<p class="center">THE TEXAS CONSTITUTION</p><br /><p class="center">APPENDIX.  Notes on Temporary Provisions for Adopted Amendments</p><br /><p class="left"><a name="AP.1"></a><a name="123405.112468"></a></p><p style="text-indent:13ex;padding-left:7ex;padding-right:7ex;" class="left">A temporary provision may be included in a joint resolution to amend the Texas Constitution for a variety of reasons.  A temporary provision can provide that the proposed constitutional amendment have a limited duration, but this is an exceedingly rare occurrence.  The more common uses of temporary provisions are as saving provisions or transition provisions.  A temporary saving provision "saves" from the application of a new or amended constitutional provision certain conduct or legal relationships that occurred before or existed on the effective date of the constitutional amendment.  A temporary transition provision provides for the orderly implementation of the constitutional amendment.  The most common type of temporary transition provision is one that provides an effective date for a constitutional amendment that is later in time than the effective date that would otherwise occur by operation of law.  Most temporary provisions include an expiration date; those with no expiration date remain in the constitution in perpetuity unless removed by a subsequent amendment to the constitution.</p><p class="left">1.
