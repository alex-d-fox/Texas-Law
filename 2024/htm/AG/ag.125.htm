The legislature finds that the health and safety of persons living and working in agricultural areas in the state may be improved by providing access to information regarding certain hazardous chemicals to which they may be exposed either during their normal employment activities, during emergency situations, or as a result of proximity to the use of those chemicals.  The legislature also finds that, because of the conditions of agricultural employment, there is a unique situation regarding certain agricultural laborers that makes it necessary to establish formal procedures to provide access to information regarding certain hazardous chemicals and to assure those laborers that there will be no retaliation by the employer for the exercise of rights under this chapter.  This chapter is intended to assure that accessibility to information regarding chemicals covered by this chapter be provided to agricultural laborers who may be exposed to those chemicals in agricultural workplaces, to certain emergency service organizations responsible for dealing with chemical hazards during emergency situations when those chemicals are in close proximity to residential areas, and to the department to make the information available to the general public through specific procedures.</p>

Office workers, cooks, maintenance workers, security personnel, and nonresident management are not agricultural laborers, except for purposes of a gross annual payroll determination, unless their job performance routinely involves potential exposure to chemicals covered under this chapter.  Farm and ranch laborers working solely with livestock and persons working solely in the retail sales component of a business are not agricultural laborers for purposes of this chapter.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  "Chemical name" means the scientific designation of a chemical in accordance with the nomenclature system developed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) or the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) rules of nomenclature, or a name that will clearly identify the chemical for the purpose of conducting a hazard evaluation.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  "Common name" means any designation of identification such as code name, code number, trade name, brand name, or generic name used to identify a chemical other than by its chemical name.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  "Chemical manufacturer" means an employer in Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Codes 20 through 39.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(5)  "Designated representative" means the individual or organization to whom an agricultural laborer gives written authorization to exercise the laborer's rights under this chapter.  A designated representative is not required to reveal the name of the agricultural laborer he represents if the department has reviewed the laborer's written authorization, certifies that the representative has that authorization, and determines that the agricultural laborer would be entitled to the information the designated representative is seeking to obtain.  A recognized or certified collective bargaining agent shall be treated automatically as a designated representative without regard to written authorization from a laborer.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(6)  "Distributor" means any business, other than a chemical manufacturer or importer, that supplies chemicals covered by this chapter to other distributors or to purchasers.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(7)  "Expose" or "exposure" means that an agricultural laborer is subjected to a chemical covered by this chapter in the course of employment through any route of entry, including inhalation, ingestion, skin contact, or absorption, and includes potential, possible, or accidental exposure.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(8)  "Fire chief" means the elected or paid administrative head of a fire department as defined in Chapter <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=AG&amp;Value=125">125</a>, Acts of the 45th Legislature, Regular Session, 1937 (Article <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CV&amp;Value=6243e">6243e</a>, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes).</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(9)  "Label" means any written, printed, or graphic material displayed on or affixed to containers of chemicals covered by this chapter.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(10)  "Material safety data sheet" ("MSDS") means a document containing chemical hazard and safe handling information that is prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard for that document or, in the case of a chemical labeled under the federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. Section 136 et seq.) for which an MSDS is both unavailable and not required under the federal OSHA's hazard communication standard, a product label or other equivalent document with precautionary statements, such as hazards to humans and domestic animals, and environmental, physical, or chemical hazards, including warning statements.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(11)  "Work area" means a room, defined space, or field where chemicals covered by this chapter are stored or used and where agricultural laborers may be present.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(12)  "Workplace" means a geographical location containing one or more work areas.</p>
