FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.  (a)  It is hereby found and declared that:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the insects Anthonomus grandis Boheman, known as the boll weevil, and Pectinophora gossypiella, known as the pink bollworm, are public nuisances and a menace to the cotton industry, and their eradication is a public necessity;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  because of the differences in soil conditions, growing seasons, farming techniques, and climate conditions among several areas in the state where cotton is grown, the eradication and suppression of the nuisance can best be accomplished by dividing the cotton-growing areas into separate zones so that integrated pest management programs may be developed for each zone;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  there is a need for a quasi-governmental entity acting under the supervision and control of the commissioner whose members are actual cotton growers who would be represented on the board of the entity by directors elected by them to manage eradication and suppression programs and to furnish expertise in the field of insect control and eradication, because such an entity would enhance the interest and participation of cotton growers in the program;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  because of the progress made in eradication, investments made by cotton growers in certain areas, the potential injustice to certain cotton growers who have made such investments, and the stage of development of the cotton crops in the statutory eradication zones, an urgent public necessity exists to validate and ratify the assessments, agreements, and obligations of the Texas Boll Weevil Eradication Foundation, Inc., made or incurred by the foundation and related to certain statutory zones;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(5)  cotton growers, in partnership with the state and federal governments, have made significant investments toward the eradication of these pests in this state;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(6)  it is essential to the well-being of the cotton industry and the agricultural economy of this state that the investments of the cotton growers and the state and federal governments be protected; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(7)  the establishment of a maintenance program to be carried out by the foundation under the supervision of the department is required to protect the investments in eradication.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  It is the intent of the legislature that the program of eradication and suppression be carried out with the best available integrated pest management techniques.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  The department may recover costs for administration of this subchapter.</p>

(a)  A cotton grower who fails to pay an assessment levied under this subchapter when due may be subject, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing, to a penalty set by the commissioner.  In determining the amount of the penalty to be assessed, the commissioner shall consider:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the seriousness of the violation, including the nature, circumstances, and extent of the violation;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  the history of previous violations;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  the amount necessary to deter future violations;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  the economic situation of the cotton grower;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(5)  any other matter that justice may require.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  The foundation may develop a compliance certificate program to manage the payment and collection of an assessment levied under this subchapter.

The rules may include:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  provisions establishing and relating to the obligations of growers, ginners, and buyers in due course of cotton produced in active eradication zones to ensure that assessments are paid within a prescribed time period;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  provisions allowing incentives in the form of discounted assessments for growers who pay assessments within a prescribed time period;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  provisions establishing penalties and interest against growers who pay assessments after a prescribed time period;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  other provisions the commissioner may determine are proper.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  In addition to any other remedies for the collection of assessments and penalties, an assessment lien in favor of the foundation attaches and is perfected 60 days after the date the foundation mails notice of the assessment on cotton produced and harvested that year from the acreage that is subject to the assessment that is due and unpaid.  An assessment lien is not an agricultural lien for the purposes of Chapter <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&amp;Value=9">9</a>, Business &amp; Commerce Code, and is not subject to the provisions of that chapter.

A buyer of cotton takes free of the assessment lien if the buyer:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  receives a compliance certificate issued by the foundation when the buyer purchases the cotton that certifies that the assessment has been paid to the foundation;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  pays for the cotton by a check on which the department is named as a joint payee;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  does not receive notice of the assessment lien as required by the Food Security Act of 1985 (7 U.S.C.
