The Commission or an authorized committee of the Commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted rule or amendment for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the Commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty (30) days after posting.

A challenge shall be made in writing, and delivered to the Chair of the Commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the Commission.</p><p class="center">ARTICLE XII.  OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ENFORCEMENT</p><br /><p style="padding-left:5ex;" class="left">A.  Oversight</p><p style="text-indent:5ex;padding-left:10ex;" class="left">1.  The Executive, Legislative and Judicial branches of state government in each Compact State shall enforce this Compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the Compact's purposes and intent. The provisions of this Compact and the rules promulgated hereunder shall have standing as statutory law.</p><p style="text-indent:5ex;padding-left:10ex;" class="left">2.  All courts shall take judicial notice of the Compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a Compact State pertaining to the subject matter of this Compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the Commission.</p><p style="text-indent:5ex;padding-left:10ex;" class="left">3.  The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the Commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact or promulgated rules.</p><p style="padding-left:5ex;" class="left">B.  Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination</p><p style="text-indent:5ex;padding-left:10ex;" class="left">1.

Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other Compact States of the nature of the default, the proposed means of remedying the default and/or any other action to be taken by the Commission; and</p><p style="text-indent:10ex;padding-left:15ex;" class="left">b.  Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.</p><p style="text-indent:5ex;padding-left:10ex;" class="left">2.  If a state in default fails to remedy the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the Compact States, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact shall be terminated on the effective date of termination. A remedy of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.</p><p style="text-indent:5ex;padding-left:10ex;" class="left">3.  Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be submitted by the Commission to the Governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the Compact States.</p><p style="text-indent:5ex;padding-left:10ex;" class="left">4.  A Compact State which has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations which extend beyond the effective date of termination.</p><p style="text-indent:5ex;padding-left:10ex;" class="left">5.  The Commission shall not bear any costs incurred by the state which is found to be in default or which has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting state.</p><p style="text-indent:5ex;padding-left:10ex;" class="left">6.  The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the state of Georgia or the federal district where the Compact has its principal offices. The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.</p><p style="padding-left:5ex;" class="left">C.  Dispute Resolution</p><p style="text-indent:5ex;padding-left:10ex;" class="left">1.  Upon request by a Compact State, the Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact which arise among Compact States and between Compact and Non-Compact States.</p><p style="text-indent:5ex;padding-left:10ex;" class="left">2.  The Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes that arise before the commission.</p><p style="padding-left:5ex;" class="left">D.  Enforcement</p><p style="text-indent:5ex;padding-left:10ex;" class="left">1.  The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and Rules of this Compact.</p><p style="text-indent:5ex;padding-left:10ex;" class="left">2.  By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the State of Georgia or the federal district where the Compact has its principal offices against a Compact State in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules and Bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.</p><p style="text-indent:5ex;padding-left:10ex;" class="left">3.  The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.</p><p class="center">ARTICLE XIII.
