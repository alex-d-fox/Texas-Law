In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on a nurse's authority to practice within that party state.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  complete any pending investigation of a nurse who changes primary state of residence during the course of such investigation.

All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against a nurse's multistate license shall include a statement that the nurse's multistate licensure privilege is deactivated in all party states during the pendency of the order.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  Nothing in this compact shall override a party state's decision that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action.
