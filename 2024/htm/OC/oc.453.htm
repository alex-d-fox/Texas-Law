The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes.

Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default and/or any other action to be taken by the Commission; and</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;padding-left:24ex;" class="left">b.  Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;padding-left:18ex;" class="left">2.  If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;padding-left:18ex;" class="left">3.  Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member states.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;padding-left:18ex;" class="left">4.

The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting state.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;padding-left:18ex;" class="left">6.  The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices.

The Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">D.  Enforcement</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;padding-left:18ex;" class="left">1.  The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this Compact.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;padding-left:18ex;" class="left">2.  By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices against a member state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;padding-left:17ex;" class="left">3.  The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">SECTION 11.

A member state's withdrawal shall not take effect until six (6) months after enactment of the repealing statute.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;padding-left:18ex;" class="left">2.

CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">This Compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof.  The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.  If this Compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any party state, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining party states and in full force and effect as to the party state affected as to all severable matters.</p>
