Appropriate alternative ratemaking methodologies are the introduction of new customer classes, the cash needs method, and phased and multi-step rate changes.  The regulatory authority may also adopt system improvement charges that may be periodically adjusted to ensure timely recovery of infrastructure investment.  The utility commission by rule shall establish a schedule that requires all utilities that have implemented a system improvement charge approved by the utility commission to make periodic filings with the utility commission to modify or review base rates charged by the utility.  Overall revenues determined according to an alternative ratemaking methodology adopted under this section must provide revenues to the utility that satisfy the requirements of Subsection (a).  The regulatory authority may not approve rates under an alternative ratemaking methodology unless the regulatory authority adopts the methodology before the date the rate application was administratively complete.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  A regulatory authority other than the utility commission may not approve an acquisition adjustment for a system purchased before the effective date of an ordinance authorizing acquisition adjustments.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  In determining to use an alternative ratemaking methodology, the regulatory authority shall assure that rates, operations, and services are just and reasonable to the consumers and to the utilities.</p>

The inclusion of construction work in progress is an exceptional form of rate relief to be granted only on the demonstration by the utility by clear and convincing evidence that the inclusion is in the ratepayers' best interest and is necessary to the financial integrity of the utility. Construction work in progress may not be included in the rate base for major projects under construction to the extent that those projects have been inefficiently or imprudently planned or managed.  Original cost is the actual money cost or the actual money value of any consideration paid, other than money, of the property at the time it shall have been dedicated to public use, whether by the utility that is the present owner or by a predecessor, less depreciation.  Utility property funded by explicit customer agreements or customer contributions in aid of construction such as surcharges may not be included in invested capital.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  Cost of facilities, revenues, expenses, taxes, and reserves shall be separated or allocated as prescribed by the regulatory authority.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  Net income is the total revenues of the utility less all reasonable and necessary expenses as determined by the regulatory authority.  The regulatory authority shall:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  base a utility's expenses on historic test year information adjusted for known and measurable changes, as determined by utility commission rules; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  determine expenses and revenues in a manner consistent with Subsections (e) through (h) of this section.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  Payment to affiliated interests for costs of any services, or any property, right or thing, or for interest expense may not be allowed either as capital cost or as expense except to the extent that the regulatory authority finds that payment to be reasonable and necessary.  A finding of reasonableness and necessity must include specific statements setting forth the cost to the affiliate of each item or class of items in question and a finding that the price to the utility is no higher than prices charged by the supplying affiliate to its other affiliates or divisions for the same item or items, or to unaffiliated persons or corporations.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  If an expense is allowed to be included in utility rates or an investment is included in the utility rate base, the related income tax benefit must be included in the computation of income tax expense to reduce the rates. If an expense is not allowed to be included in utility rates or an investment is not included in the utility rate base, the related income tax benefit may not be included in the computation of income tax expense to reduce the rates.  The income tax expense shall be computed using the statutory income tax rates.  The amount of income tax that a consolidated group of which a utility is a member saves, because the consolidated return eliminates the intercompany profit on purchases by the utility from an affiliate, shall be applied to reduce the cost of the property or service purchased from the affiliate.   The investment tax credit allowed against federal income taxes to the extent retained by the utility shall be applied as a reduction in the rate-based contribution of the assets to which the credit applies to the extent and at the rate as allowed by the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  The regulatory authority may promulgate reasonable rules and regulations with respect to the allowance or disallowance of certain expenses for ratemaking purposes.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  The regulatory authority may not include for ratemaking purposes:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  legislative advocacy expenses, whether made directly or indirectly, including legislative advocacy expenses included in trade association dues;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  costs of processing a refund or credit under this subchapter; or</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  any expenditure found by the regulatory authority to be unreasonable, unnecessary, or not in the public interest, including executive salaries, advertising expenses, legal expenses, and civil penalties or fines.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  Water and sewer utility property in service that was acquired from an affiliate or developer before September 1, 1976, and that is included by the utility in its rate base shall be included in all ratemaking formulas at the installed cost of the property rather than the price set between the entities.  Unless the funds for this property are provided by explicit customer agreements, the property is considered invested capital and not contributions in aid of construction or customer-contributed capital.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  Depreciation expense included in the cost of service includes depreciation on all currently used, depreciable utility property owned by the utility except for property provided by explicit customer agreements or funded by customer contributions in aid of construction.

The utility may send the statement of intent to a ratepayer by e-mail only if the ratepayer has agreed to receive communications electronically.

The application must include information the regulatory authority requires by rule and any appropriate cost and rate schedules supporting the requested rate increase.   If the utility fails to provide within a reasonable time after the application is filed the necessary documentation or other evidence that supports the costs and expenses that are shown in the application, the regulatory authority may disallow the nonsupported costs or expenses.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  Except as provided by Subsection (f) or (g), if the application or the statement of intent is not substantially complete or does not comply with the regulatory authority's rules, it may be rejected and the effective date of the rate change may be suspended until a properly completed application is accepted by the regulatory authority and a proper statement of intent is provided.  The utility commission may also suspend the effective date of any rate change if the utility does not have a certificate of public convenience and necessity or a completed application for a certificate or to transfer a certificate pending before the utility commission or if the utility is delinquent in paying the assessment and any applicable penalties or interest required by Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&amp;Value=5.701">5.701</a>(n).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  After written notice to the utility, a local regulatory authority may suspend the effective date of a rate change for not more than 90 days from the proposed effective date.

This approval is subject to the authority of the local regulatory authority thereafter to continue a hearing in progress.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  After written notice to the utility, the utility commission may suspend the effective date of a rate change for not more than 265 days from the proposed effective date.

This approval is subject to the authority of the utility commission thereafter to continue a hearing in progress.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  The 265-day period described by Subsection (g) shall be extended by two days for each day a hearing exceeds 15 days.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  If, before the 91st day after the effective date of the rate change, the regulatory authority receives a complaint from any affected municipality, or from the lesser of 1,000 or 10 percent of the ratepayers of the utility over whose rates the regulatory authority has original jurisdiction, the regulatory authority shall set the matter for hearing.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  If the regulatory authority receives at least the number of complaints from ratepayers required for the regulatory authority to set a hearing under Subsection (i), the regulatory authority may, pending the hearing and a decision, suspend the date the rate change would otherwise be effective.

The utility commission may delegate to an administrative law judge of the State Office of Administrative Hearings the responsibility and authority to give reasonable notice for the hearing, including notice to the governing body of each affected municipality and county.  The utility is not required to provide a formal answer or file any other formal pleading in response to the notice, and the absence of an answer does not affect an order for a hearing.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(n)  The utility shall mail notice of the hearing to each ratepayer before the hearing.  The notice must include a description of the process by which a ratepayer may intervene in the ratemaking proceeding.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(o)  If, after hearing, the regulatory authority finds the rates currently being charged or those proposed to be charged are unreasonable or in violation of law, the regulatory authority shall determine the rates to be charged by the utility and shall fix the rates by order served on the utility.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(p)  A utility may put a changed rate into effect throughout the area in which the utility sought to change its rates, including an area over which the utility commission is exercising appellate or original jurisdiction, by filing a bond with the utility commission if the suspension period has been extended under Subsection (h) and the utility commission fails to make a final determination before the 266th day after the date the rate change would otherwise be effective.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(q)  The bonded rate may not exceed the proposed rate.  The bond must be payable to the utility commission in an amount, in a form, and with a surety approved by the utility commission and conditioned on refund.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(r)  Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties to the rate proceeding, the utility shall refund or credit against future bills:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  all sums collected under the bonded rates in excess of the rate finally ordered; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  interest on those sums at the current interest rate as determined by the regulatory authority.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(s)  At any time during the pendency of the rate proceeding the regulatory authority may fix interim rates to remain in effect during the applicable suspension period under Subsection (f) or Subsections (g) and (h) or until a final determination is made on the proposed rate.  If the regulatory authority does not establish interim rates, the rates in effect when the application described by Subsection (d) was filed continue in effect during the suspension period.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(t)  If the regulatory authority sets a final rate that is higher than the interim rate, the utility shall be allowed to collect the difference between the interim rate and final rate unless otherwise agreed to by the parties to the rate proceeding.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(u)  For good cause shown, the regulatory authority may at any time during the proceeding require the utility to refund money collected under a proposed rate before the rate was suspended or an interim rate was established to the extent the proposed rate exceeds the existing rate or the interim rate.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(v)  If a regulatory authority other than the utility commission establishes interim rates or bonded rates, the regulatory authority must make a final determination on the rates not later than the first anniversary of the effective date of the interim rates or bonded rates or the rates are automatically approved as requested by the utility.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(w)  Except to implement a rate adjustment provision approved by the regulatory authority by rule or ordinance, as applicable, or to adjust the rates of a newly acquired utility system, a utility or two or more utilities under common control and ownership may not file a statement of intent to increase its rates more than once in a 12-month period, unless the regulatory authority determines that a financial hardship exists.  If the regulatory authority requires the utility to deliver a corrected statement of intent, the utility is not considered to be in violation of the 12-month filing requirement.</p>

(a)  In the event that an area is incorporated or annexed by a municipality, either before or after the effective date of this section, the municipality and a retail public utility that provides water or sewer service to all or part of the area pursuant to a certificate of convenience and necessity may agree in writing that all or part of the area may be served by a municipally owned utility, by a franchised utility, or by the retail public utility.  In this section, the phrase "franchised utility" shall mean a retail public utility that has been granted a franchise by a municipality to provide water or sewer service inside municipal boundaries.  The agreement may provide for single or dual certification of all or part of the area, for the purchase of facilities or property, and for such other or additional terms that the parties may agree on.  If a franchised utility is to serve the area, the franchised utility shall also be a party to the agreement.  The executed agreement shall be filed with the utility commission, and the utility commission, on receipt of the agreement, shall incorporate the terms of the agreement into the respective certificates of convenience and necessity of the parties to the agreement.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  If an agreement is not executed within 180 days after the municipality, in writing, notifies the retail public utility of its intent to provide service to the incorporated or annexed area, and if the municipality desires and intends to provide retail utility service to the area, the municipality, prior to providing service to the area, shall file an application with the utility commission to grant single certification to the municipally owned water or sewer utility or to a franchised utility.  If an application for single certification is filed, the utility commission shall fix a time and place for a hearing and give notice of the hearing to the municipality and franchised utility, if any, and notice of the application and hearing to the retail public utility.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b-1)  On the day a municipality submits an application for single certification to the utility commission under this section, the municipality shall send, via certified mail or hand delivery, a copy of the application to the retail public utility.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  The utility commission by order shall grant single certification to the municipality.  The utility commission shall also determine in its order the monetary amount that is adequate and just to compensate the retail public utility for any of the retail public utility's property the utility commission determines is being rendered useless or valueless by the single certification.  If the municipality in its application has requested the transfer of specified property of the retail public utility to the municipality or to a franchised utility, the utility commission shall also determine in its order the adequate and just compensation to be paid for such property pursuant to the provisions of this section, including an award for damages to property remaining in the ownership of the retail public utility after single certification.  The order of the utility commission shall not be effective to transfer property.  A transfer of property may be obtained under this section only by a court judgment rendered under Subsection (d) or (e).  The grant of single certification by the utility commission takes effect on the date the municipality or franchised utility, as the case may be, pays adequate and just compensation pursuant to court order, or pays an amount into the registry of the court or to the retail public utility under Subsection (f).  If the court judgment provides that the retail public utility is not entitled to any compensation, the grant of single certification takes effect when the court judgment becomes final.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c-1)  The utility commission by rule shall require the municipality or franchised utility to submit a report to the utility commission verifying that the municipality or franchised utility has paid all required adequate and just compensation to the retail public utility as provided by Subsection (c).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c-2)  The municipality or franchised utility must provide to each customer of the retail public utility being acquired an individual written notice within 60 days after the effective date for the transfer specified in the court judgment. The notice must clearly advise the customer of the identity of the new service provider, the reason for the transfer, the rates to be charged by the new service provider, and the effective date of those rates.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c-3)  Before filing an appeal under Subsection (e) and not later than the seventh day after the date the utility commission issues a final order under Subsection (c), the retail public utility may appeal the final order to the utility commission in a separate hearing before the utility commission.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  In the event the final order of the utility commission is not appealed within 30 days, the municipality may request the district court of Travis County to enter a judgment consistent with the order of the utility commission.  In such event, the court shall render a judgment that:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  transfers to the municipally owned utility or franchised utility title to property to be transferred to the municipally owned utility or franchised utility as delineated by the utility commission's final order and property determined by the utility commission to be rendered useless or valueless by the granting of single certification; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  orders payment to the retail public utility of adequate and just compensation for the property as determined by the utility commission in its final order.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  Any party that is aggrieved by a final order of the utility commission under this section may file an appeal with the district court of Travis County within 30 days after the order becomes final.  The hearing in such an appeal before the district court shall be by trial de novo on all issues.  After the hearing, if the court determines that the municipally owned utility or franchised utility is entitled to single certification under the provisions of this section, the court shall enter a judgment that:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  transfers to the municipally owned utility or franchised utility title to property requested by the municipality to be transferred to the municipally owned utility or franchised utility and located within the singly certificated area and property determined by the court or jury to be rendered useless or valueless by the granting of single certification; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  orders payment in accordance with Subsection (g) to the retail public utility of adequate and just compensation for the property transferred and for the property damaged as determined by the court or jury.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  Transfer of property shall be effective on the date the judgment becomes final.  However, after the judgment of the court is entered, the municipality or franchised utility may take possession of condemned property pending appeal if the municipality or franchised utility pays the retail public utility or pays into the registry of the court, subject to withdrawal by the retail public utility, the amount, if any, established in the court's judgment as just and adequate compensation.  To provide security in the event an appellate court, or the trial court in a new trial or on remand, awards compensation in excess of the original award, the municipality or franchised utility, as the case may be, shall deposit in the registry of the court an additional sum in the amount of the award, or a surety bond in the same amount issued by a surety company qualified to do business in this state, conditioned to secure the payment of an award of damages in excess of the original award of the trial court.  On application by the municipality or franchised utility, the court shall order that funds deposited in the registry of the court be deposited in an interest-bearing account, and that interest accruing prior to withdrawal of the award by the retail public utility be paid to the municipality or to the franchised utility.  In the event the municipally owned utility or franchised utility takes possession of property or provides utility service in the singly certificated area pending appeal, and a court in a final judgment in an appeal under this section holds that the grant of single certification was in error, the retail public utility is entitled to seek compensation for any damages sustained by it in accordance with Subsection (g) of this section.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  For the purpose of implementing this section, the value of real property owned and utilized by the retail public utility for its facilities shall be determined according to the standards set forth in Chapter <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&amp;Value=21">21</a>, Property Code, governing actions in eminent domain;  the value of personal property shall be determined according to the factors in this subsection.  The factors ensuring that the compensation to a retail public utility is just and adequate, shall, at a minimum, include:  impact on the existing indebtedness of the retail public utility and its ability to repay that debt, the value of the service facilities of the retail public utility located within the area in question, the amount of any expenditures for planning, design, or construction of service facilities outside the incorporated or annexed area that are allocable to service to the area in question, the amount of the retail public utility's contractual obligations allocable to the area in question, any demonstrated impairment of service or increase of cost to consumers of the retail public utility remaining after the single certification, the impact on future revenues lost from existing customers, necessary and reasonable legal expenses and professional fees, factors relevant to maintaining the current financial integrity of the retail public utility, and other relevant factors.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g-1)  The utility commission shall adopt rules governing the evaluation of the factors to be considered in determining the monetary compensation under Subsection (g).

For an area annexed by a municipality, the compensation provided under Subsection (g) shall be determined by a qualified individual or firm to which the municipality and the retail public utility agree to serve as independent appraiser.  If the retail public utility and the municipality are unable to agree on a single individual or firm to serve as the independent appraiser before the 11th day after the date the retail public utility or municipality notifies the other party of the impasse, the retail public utility and municipality each shall appoint a qualified individual or firm to serve as independent appraiser.  On or before the 10th business day after the date of their appointment, the independent appraisers shall meet to reach an agreed determination of the amount of compensation.  If the appraisers are unable to agree on a determination before the 16th business day after the date of their first meeting under this subsection, the retail public utility or municipality may petition the utility commission or a person the utility commission designates for the purpose to appoint a third qualified independent appraiser to reconcile the appraisals of the two originally appointed appraisers.  The determination of the third appraiser may not be less than the lesser or more than the greater of the two original appraisals.  The costs of the independent appraisers for an annexed area shall be shared equally by the retail public utility and the municipality.  The determination of compensation under this subsection is binding on the utility commission.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(m)  The utility commission shall deny an application for single certification by a municipality that fails to demonstrate compliance with the commission's minimum requirements for public drinking water systems.</p>

An action may not be maintained against a title insurance company for the failure to disclose that the described real property is included within the certificated service area of a utility service provider if the utility service provider did not file in the real property records or with the utility commission the map of the certificated service area.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  Any purchaser who purchases real property in a certificated service area of a utility service provider and who subsequently sells or conveys the property is conclusively considered on the closing of the subsequent sale to have waived any previous right to damages under this section.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  It is the express intent of this section that any seller, title insurance company, examining attorney, vendor of property and tax information, real estate broker, or lienholder, or any agent, representative, or person acting on behalf of the seller, company, attorney, vendor, broker, or lienholder, may rely for the purpose of completing the notice required by this section on the accuracy of the map of the certificated service area of the utility service provider filed in the real property records by the utility service provider.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(l)  Except as otherwise provided by Subsection (e), if any sale or conveyance of real property within the certificated service area of a utility service provider fails to comply with this section, the purchaser may file a suit for damages under Subsection (m) or (n).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(m)  If the sale or conveyance of real property fails to comply with this section, the purchaser may file a suit for damages in the amount of all costs related to the purchase of the property plus interest and reasonable attorney's fees.  The suit for damages may be filed jointly or severally against the individual or entity that sold or conveyed the property to the purchaser.  Following the recovery of damages under this subsection, the amount of the damages shall be paid first to satisfy all unpaid obligations on each outstanding lien on the property and the remainder of the damage amount shall be paid to the purchaser.  On payment of all damages respectively to each lienholder and the purchaser, the purchaser shall reconvey the property to the seller.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(n)  If the sale or conveyance of the property fails to comply with this section, the purchaser may file a suit for damages in an amount not to exceed $5,000, plus reasonable attorney's fees.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(o)  A purchaser may not recover damages under both Subsections (m) and (n).

Notwithstanding general or special law or the common law of this state to the contrary, the relief provided under Subsections (m) and (n) provides the exclusive remedy for a purchaser aggrieved by the seller's failure to comply with this section.  Any action for damages under this section does not apply to, affect, alter, or impair the validity of any existing vendor's lien, mechanic's lien, or deed of trust lien on the property.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(p)  A suit for damages under this section must be filed by the earlier of:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  a date on or before the 90th day after the date the purchaser discovers:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  the cost the purchaser is required to pay to the utility service provider to obtain water or sewer service;  or</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  the period required by the utility service provider to provide water or sewer service;  or</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  the fourth anniversary of the date the property was sold or conveyed to the purchaser.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(q)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the contrary, a purchaser may not recover damages under this section if the person:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  purchases an equity interest in real property and, in conjunction with the purchase, assumes any liens, including a purchase money lien;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  does not require proof of title by abstract, title insurance policy, or any other method.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(r)  A utility service provider shall:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  record in the real property records of each county in which the service area or a portion of the service area is located a certified copy of the map of the certificate of public convenience and necessity and of any amendment to the certificate as contained in the utility commission's records, and a boundary description of the service area by:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  a metes and bounds survey certified by a licensed state land surveyor or a registered professional land surveyor;</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  the Texas State Plane Coordinate System;</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(C)  verifiable landmarks, including a road, creek, or railroad line; or</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(D)  if a recorded plat of the area exists, lot and block number; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  submit to the utility commission evidence of the recording.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(s)  Each county shall accept and file in its real property records a utility service provider's map presented to the county clerk under this section if the map meets filing requirements, does not exceed 11 inches by 17 inches in size, and is accompanied by the appropriate fee.
