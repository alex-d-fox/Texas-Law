To fully address bay and estuary environmental flow issues, the foundation of work accomplished by the state should be improved.  While the state's instream flow studies program appears to encompass a comprehensive and scientific approach for establishing a process to assess instream flow needs for rivers and streams across the state, more extensive review and examination of the details of the program, which may not be fully developed until the program is under way, are needed to ensure an effective tool for evaluating riverine environmental flow conditions.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d-5)  The legislature finds that the management of water to meet instream flow and freshwater inflow needs should be evaluated on a regular basis and adapted to reflect both improvements in science related to environmental flows and future changes in projected human needs for water.  In addition, the development of management strategies for addressing environmental flow needs should be an ongoing, adaptive process that considers and addresses local issues.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d-6)  The legislature finds that recommendations for state action to protect instream flows and freshwater inflows should be developed through a consensus-based, regional approach involving balanced representation of stakeholders and that such a process should be encouraged throughout the state.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  The fact that greater pressures and demands are being placed on the water resources of the state makes it of paramount importance to ensure that these important priorities are effectively addressed by detailing how environmental flow standards are to be developed using the environmental studies that have been and are to be performed by the state and others and specifying in clear delegations of authority how those environmental flow standards will be integrated into the regional water planning and water permitting process.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  The legislature recognizes that effective implementation of the approach provided by this chapter for protecting instream flows and freshwater inflows will require more effective water rights administration and enforcement systems than are currently available in most areas of the state.</p>

In determining what conditions to include in the permit under this subsection, the commission shall consider among other factors:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the studies mandated by Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&amp;Value=16.059">16.059</a>; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  any water quality assessment performed under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&amp;Value=11.150">11.150</a>.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  The commission shall include in the permit, to the extent practicable when considering all public interests, those conditions considered by the commission necessary to maintain fish and wildlife habitats.

With respect to an amended water right, the provision may not allow the commission to adjust a condition of the amendment other than a condition that applies only to the increase in the amount of water to be stored, taken, or diverted authorized by the amendment.  This subsection does not affect an appropriation of or an authorization to store, take, or divert water under a permit or amendment to a water right issued before September 1, 2007.
