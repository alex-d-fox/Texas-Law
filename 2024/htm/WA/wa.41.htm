Hinderlider</p><br /><p class="center">For the State of New Mexico--Thomas M. McClure</p><br /><p class="center">For the State of Texas--Frank B. Clayton</p><br /><p class="right">who, after negotiations participated in by S.O. Harper, appointed by the President as the representative of the United States of America, have agreed upon the following Articles, to wit:</p><p class="center">Article I</p><br /><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(a)  The State of Colorado, the State of New Mexico, the State of Texas, and the United States of America, are hereinafter designated "Colorado," "New Mexico," "Texas," and the "United States," respectively.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  "The Commission" means the agency created by this Compact for the administration thereof.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  The term "Rio Grande Basin" means all of the territory drained by the Rio Grande and its tributaries in Colorado, in New Mexico, and in Texas above Fort Quitman, including the Closed Basin in Colorado.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  The "Closed Basin" means that part of the Rio Grande Basin in Colorado where the streams drain into the San Luis Lakes and adjacent territory, and do not normally contribute to the flow of the Rio Grande.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  The term "tributary" means any stream which naturally contributes to the flow of the Rio Grande.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  "Transmountain Diversion" is water imported into the drainage basin of the Rio Grande from any stream system outside of the Rio Grande Basin, exclusive of the Closed Basin.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  "Annual Debits" are the amounts by which actual deliveries in any calendar year fall below scheduled deliveries.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  "Annual Credits" are the amounts by which actual deliveries in any calendar year exceed scheduled deliveries.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  "Accrued Debits" are the amounts by which the sum of all annual debits exceeds the sum of all annual credits over any common period of time.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  "Accrued Credits" are the amounts by which the sum of all annual credits exceeds the sum of all annual debits over any common period of time.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  "Project Storage" is the combined capacity of Elephant Butte Reservoir and all other reservoirs actually available for the storage of usable water below Elephant Butte and above the first diversion to lands of the Rio Grande Project, but not more than a total of two million, six hundred and thirty-eight thousand, eight hundred and sixty (2,638,860) acre-feet.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(l)  "Usable Water" is all water, exclusive of credit water, which is in project storage and which is available for release in accordance with irrigation demands, including deliveries to Mexico.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(m)  "Credit Water" is that amount of water in project storage which is equal to the accrued credit of Colorado or New Mexico or both.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(n)  "Unfilled Capacity" is the difference between the total physical capacity of project storage and the amount of usable water then in storage.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(o)  "Actual Release" is the amount of usable water released in any calendar year from the lowest reservoir comprising project storage.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(p)  "Actual Spill" is all water which is actually spilled from Elephant Butte Reservoir, or is released therefrom for flood control, in excess of the current demand on project storage and which does not become usable water by storage in another reservoir;  provided, that actual spill of usable water cannot occur until all credit water shall have been spilled.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(q)  "Hypothetical Spill" is the time in any year at which usable water would have spilled from project storage if seven hundred and ninety thousand (790,000) acre-feet had been released therefrom at rates proportional to the actual release in every year from the starting date to the end of the year in which hypothetical spill occurs;  in computing hypothetical spill the initial condition shall be the amount of usable water in project storage at the beginning of the calendar year following the effective date of this Compact, and thereafter the initial condition shall be the amount of usable water in project storage at the beginning of the calendar year following each actual spill.</p><p

Within the physical limitations of storage capacity in such reservoirs, New Mexico shall retain water in storage at all times to the extent of its accrued debit.

 provided, further, that if the Commissioners for the States having accrued credits authorize the release of part, or all, of such credits in advance of spill, the amount so released shall be deemed to constitute actual spill.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">In any year in which there is actual spill of usable water, or at the time of hypothetical spill thereof, all accrued debits of Colorado or New Mexico, or both, at the beginning of the year shall be cancelled.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">In any year in which the aggregate of accrued debits of Colorado and New Mexico exceeds the minimum unfilled capacity of project storage, such debits shall be reduced proportionally to an aggregate amount equal to such minimum unfilled capacity.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">To the extent that accrued credits are impounded in reservoirs between San Marcial and Courchesne, and to the extent that accrued debits are impounded in reservoirs above San Marcial, such credits and debits shall be reduced annually to compensate for evaporation losses in the proportion that such credits or debits bore to the total amount of water in such reservoirs during the year.</p><p class="center">Article VII</p><br /><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Neither Colorado nor New Mexico shall increase the amount of water in storage in reservoirs constructed after 1929 whenever there is less than four hundred thousand (400,000) acre-feet of usable water in project storage;  provided, that if the actual releases of usable water from the beginning of the calendar year following the effective date of this Compact, or from the beginning of the calendar year following actual spill, have aggregated more than an average of seven hundred and ninety thousand (790,000) acre-feet per annum, the time at which such minimum stage is reached shall be adjusted to compensate for the difference between the total actual release and releases at such average rate;
