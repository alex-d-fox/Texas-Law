Prentiss as the representative of the United States, the said representatives for Texas and Louisiana, after negotiations participated in by the representative of the United States, have for such Compact agreed upon Articles as hereinafter set forth. The major purposes of this Compact are to provide for an equitable apportionment between the States of Louisiana and Texas of the waters of the Sabine River and its tributaries, thereby removing the causes of present and future controversy between the States over the conservation and utilization of said waters;  to encourage the development, conservation and utilization of the water resources of the Sabine River and its tributaries;  and to establish a basis for cooperative planning and action by the States for the construction, operation and maintenance of projects for water conservation and utilization purposes on that reach of the Sabine River touching both States, and for apportionment of the benefits therefrom.</p><p class="center">ARTICLE I</p><br /><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">As used in this Compact:</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(a)  The word "Stateline" means the point on the Sabine River where its waters in downstream flow first touch the States of both Louisiana and Texas.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  The term "waters of the Sabine River" means the waters either originating in the natural drainage basin of the Sabine River, or appearing as streamflow in said River and its tributaries, from its headwater source down to the mouth of the River where it enters into Sabine Lake.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  The term "Stateline flow" means the flow of waters of the Sabine River as determined by the Logansport gauge located on the U.S. Highway 84, approximately four (4) river miles downstream from the Stateline.  This flow, or the flow as determined by such substitute gauging station as may be established by the Administration, as hereinafter defined, pursuant to the provisions of Article VII of this Compact, shall be deemed the actual Stateline flow.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  The term "Stateline reach" means that portion of the Sabine River lying between the Stateline and Sabine Lake.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  The term "the Administration" means the Sabine River Compact Administration established under Article VII.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  The term "Domestic use" means the use of water by an individual, or by a family unit or household for drinking, cooking, laundering, sanitation and other personal comforts and necessities;  and for the irrigation of an area not to exceed one acre, obtained directly from the Sabine River or its tributaries by an individual or family unit, not supplied by a water company, water district or municipality.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  The term "stock water use" means the use of water for any and all livestock and poultry.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  The term "consumptive use" means use of water resulting in its permanent removal from the stream.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  The terms "domestic" and "stock water" reservoir mean any reservoir for either or both of such uses having a storage capacity of fifty (50) acre feet or less.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  "Stored water" means water stored in reservoirs (exclusive of domestic or stock water reservoirs) or water withdrawn or released from reservoirs for specific uses and the identifiable return flow from such uses.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  The term "free water" means all waters other than "stored waters" in the Stateline reach including, but not limited to, that appearing as natural stream flow and not withdrawn or released from a reservoir for specific uses.  Waters released from reservoirs for the purpose of maintaining stream flows as provided in Article V, shall be "free water".  All reservoir spills or releases of stored waters made in anticipation of spills, shall be free water.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(l)  Where the name of the State or the term "State" is used in this Compact, it shall be construed to include any person or entity of any nature whatsoever of the States of Louisiana or Texas using, claiming, or in any manner asserting any right to the use of the waters of the Sabine River under the authority of that State.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(m)  Wherever any State or Federal official or agency is referred to in this Compact, such reference shall apply equally to the comparable official or agency succeeding to their duties and functions.</p><p class="center">ARTICLE II</p><br /><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Subject to the provisions of Article X, nothing in this Compact shall be construed as applying to, or interfering with, the right or power of either signatory State to regulate within its boundaries the appropriation, use and control of water, not inconsistent with its obligation under this Compact.</p><p class="center">ARTICLE III</p><br /><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Subject to the provisions of Article X, all rights to any of the waters of the Sabine River which have been obtained in accordance with the laws of the States are hereby recognized and affirmed;  provided, however, that withdrawals, from time to time, for the satisfaction of such rights, shall be subject to the availability of supply in accordance with the apportionment of water provided under the terms of this Compact.</p><p class="center">ARTICLE IV</p><br /><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Texas shall have free and unrestricted use of all waters of the Sabine River and its tributaries above the Stateline subject, however, to the provisions of Articles V and X.</p><p class="center">ARTICLE V</p><br /><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Texas and Louisiana hereby agree upon the following apportionment of the waters of the Sabine River:</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(a)  All free water in the Stateline reach shall be divided equally between the two States, this division to be made without reference to the origin.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  The necessity of maintaining a minimum flow at the Stateline for the benefit of water users below the Stateline in both States is recognized, and to this end it is hereby agreed that:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  Reservoirs and permits above the Stateline existing as of January 1, 1953 shall not be liable for maintenance of the flow at the Stateline.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  After January 1, 1953, neither State shall permit or authorize any additional uses which would have the effect of reducing the flow at the Stateline to less than 36 cubic feet per second.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  Reservoirs on which construction is commenced after January 1, 1953, above the Stateline shall be liable for their share of water necessary to provide a minimum flow at the Stateline of 36 cubic feet per second;  provided, that no reservoir shall be liable for a greater percentage of this minimum flow than the percentage of the drainage area above the Stateline contributing to that reservoir, exclusive of the watershed of any reservoir on which construction was started prior to January 1, 1953. Water released from Texas' reservoirs to establish the minimum flow of 36 cubic feet per second, shall be classed as free water at the Stateline and divided equally between the two States.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  The right of each State to construct impoundment reservoirs and other works of improvement on the Sabine River or its tributaries located wholly within its boundaries is hereby recognized.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  In the event that either State constructs reservoir storage on the tributaries below Stateline after January 1, 1953, there shall be deducted from that State's share of the flow in the Sabine River all reductions in flow resulting from the operation of the tributary storage and conversely such State shall be entitled to the increased flow resulting from the regulation provided by such storage.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  Each State shall have the right to use the main channel of the Sabine River to convey water stored on the Sabine River or its tributaries located wholly within its boundaries, downstream to a desired point of removal without loss of ownership of such stored waters.  In the event that such water is released by a State through the natural channel of a tributary and the channel of the Sabine River to a downstream point of removal, a reduction shall be made in the amount of water which can be withdrawn at the point of removal equal to the transmission losses.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  Each State shall have the right to withdraw its share of the water from the channel of the Sabine River in the Stateline reach in accordance with Article VII.  Neither State shall withdraw at any point more than its share of the flow at that point except, that pursuant to findings and determination of the Administration as provided under Article VII of this Compact, either State may withdraw more or less of its share of the water at any point providing that its aggregate withdrawal shall not exceed its total share.  Withdrawals made pursuant to this paragraph shall not prejudice or impair the existing rights of users of Sabine River waters.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  Waters stored in reservoirs constructed by the States in the Stateline reach shall be shared by each State in proportion to its contribution to the cost of storage.  Neither State shall have the right to construct a dam on the Stateline reach without the consent of the other State.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  Each State may vary the rate and manner of withdrawal of its share of such jointly stored waters on the Stateline reach, subject to meeting the obligations for amortization of the cost of the joint storage.  In any event, neither State shall withdraw more than its prorata share in any one year (a year meaning a water year, October 1st to September 30th) except by authority of the Administration.  All jointly stored water remaining at the end of a water year shall be reapportioned between the States in the same proportion as their contribution to the cost of the storage.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  Except for jointly stored water, as provided in (h) above, each State must use its apportionment of the natural stream flows as they occur and there shall be no allowance of accumulation of credits or debits for or against either State.  The failure of either State to use the stream flow or any part thereof, the use of which is apportioned to it under the terms of this Compact, shall not constitute a relinquishment of the right to such use in the future;  conversely, the failure of either State to use the water at the time it is available does not give it the right to the flow in excess of its share of the flow at any other time.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  From the apportionment of waters of the Sabine River as defined in this Article, there shall be excluded from such apportionment all waters consumed in either State for domestic and stock water uses.  Domestic and stock water reservoirs shall be so excluded.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  Each State may use its share of the water apportioned to it in any manner that may be deemed beneficial by that State.</p><p class="center">ARTICLE VI</p><br /><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(a)  The States through their respective appropriate agencies or subdivisions may construct jointly, or cooperate with any agency or instrumentality of the United States in the construction of works on the Stateline reach for the development, conservation and utilization for all beneficial purposes of the waters of the Sabine River.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  All monetary revenues growing out of any joint State ownership, title and interest in works constructed under Section (a) above, and accruing to the States in respect thereof, shall be divided between the States in proportion to their respective contributions to the cost of construction;  provided however, that each State shall retain undivided all its revenues from recreational facilities within its boundaries incidental to the use of the waters of the Sabine River, and from its severally State-owned recreational facilities constructed appurtenant thereto.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  All operation and maintenance costs chargeable against any State ownership, title and interest in works constructed under Section (a) above, shall be assessed in proportion to the contribution of each State to the original cost of construction.</p><p class="center">ARTICLE VII</p><br /><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(a)  There is hereby created an interstate administrative agency to be designated as the "Sabine River Compact Administration" herein referred to as "the Administration".</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  The Administration shall consist of two members from each State and of one member as representative of the United States, chosen by the President of the United States, who is hereby requested to appoint such a representative.  The United States member shall be ex-officio chairman of the Administration without vote and shall not be a domiciliary of or reside in either State.  The appointed members for Texas and Louisiana shall be designated within thirty days after the effective date of this Compact.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  The Texas members shall be appointed by the Governor for a term of six years;  provided, however, that one of the original Texas members shall be appointed for a term to establish a half-term interval between the expiration dates of the terms of such members, and thereafter one such member shall be appointed each three (3) years for the regular term. The Louisiana members shall be residents of the Sabine Watershed and shall be appointed by the Governor for a term of four years, which shall run concurrent with the term of the Governor. Each state member shall hold office subject to the laws of his state or until his successor has been duly appointed and qualified.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  Interim vacancy, for whatever cause, in the office of any member of the Administration shall be filled for the unexpired term in the same manner as hereinabove provided for regular appointment.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  Within sixty days after the effective date of this Compact, the Administration shall meet and organize.
