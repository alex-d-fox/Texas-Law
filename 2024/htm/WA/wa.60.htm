Districts in this state which operate ports or waterways and harbor and terminal facilities are in keen competition with other ports, waterways, harbors, and terminals outside the state and with privately owned port and terminal facilities inside the state.  Well-situated and well-equipped ports and waterways in other nearby states and owners of substantial port and terminal facilities located inside and outside the state are advertising, promoting and developing their competing ports, waterways, harbors, and terminals through expenditure of large amounts of money without any audit or restriction on expenditure of the money.  This activity or expenditure is thwarting and impeding the use, progress, and development of the ports, waterways, harbors, and terminals of this state.  Continuation of this hardship and injustice can best be met and coped with by more liberal use of some relatively small fund set aside from the gross income from operations of the ports of this state to be used in the manner provided in this subchapter.</p>
