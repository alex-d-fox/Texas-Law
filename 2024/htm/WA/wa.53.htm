When this accumulation is completed, the board may reduce the tax levy to a rate that will produce at least 25 percent of the principal and interest requirements for each of the next succeeding years.  When actual experience of three successive years demonstrates that the net revenues are adequate to pay the principal of and the interest on the bonds as they mature, the board may discontinue the tax until it becomes necessary to levy the tax again to avoid default in paying the bonds and interest.</p>
