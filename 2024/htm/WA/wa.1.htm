The program contemplates a topic-by-topic revision of the state's general and permanent statute law without substantive change.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  Consistent with the objectives of the statutory revision program, the purpose of this code is to make the general and permanent water law more accessible and understandable, by:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  rearranging the statutes into a more logical order;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  employing a format and numbering system designed to facilitate citation of the law and to accommodate future expansion of the law;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  eliminating repealed, duplicative, unconstitutional, expired, executed, and other ineffective provisions;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  restating the law in modern American English to the greatest extent possible.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  This restatement shall not in any way make any changes in the substantive laws of the State of Texas.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  Laws of a local or special nature, such as statutes creating various kinds of conservation and reclamation districts, are not included in, or affected by, this code.

It is therefore the policy of this state to encourage voluntary land stewardship as a significant water management tool.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  "Land stewardship," as used in this code, is the voluntary practice of managing land to conserve or enhance suitable landscapes and the ecosystem values of the land.  Land stewardship includes land and habitat management, wildlife conservation, and watershed protection.  Land stewardship practices include runoff reduction, prescribed burning, managed grazing, brush management, erosion management, reseeding with native plant species, riparian management and restoration, and spring and creek-bank protection, all of which benefit the water resources of this state.</p>
