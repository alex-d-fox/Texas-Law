The Signatory States recognize that the increase in population and the growth of industrial, agricultural, mining and other activities combined with natural pollution sources may lead to a diminution of the quality of water in the Red River Basin which may render the water harmful or injurious to the health and welfare of the people and impair the usefulness or public enjoyment of the water for beneficial purposes, thereby resulting in adverse social, economic, and environmental impacts.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">"Sec. 11.02. Although affirming the primary duty and responsibility of each Signatory State to take appropriate action under its own laws to prevent, diminish, and regulate all pollution sources within its boundaries which adversely affect the water of the Red River Basin, the states recognize that the control and abatement of the naturally-occurring salinity sources as well as, under certain circumstances, the maintenance and enhancement of the quality of water in the Red River Basin may require the cooperative action of all states.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">"Sec. 11.03. The Signatory States agree to cooperate with agencies of the United States to devise and effectuate means of alleviating the natural deterioration of the water of the Red River Basin.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">"Sec. 11.04.

Upon receipt of a complaint from the governor of a Signatory State that the interstate water of the Red River Basin in which it has an interest are being materially and adversely affected by pollution and that the state in which the pollution originates has failed after reasonable notice to take appropriate abatement measures, the Commission shall make such findings as are appropriate and thereafter provide such findings to the governor of the state in which such pollution originates and request appropriate corrective action.  The Commission, however, shall not take any action with respect to pollution which adversely affects only the state in which such pollution originates.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">"Sec. 11.07. In addition to its other powers set forth under this Article, the Commission shall have the authority, upon receipt of six concurring votes, to utilize applicable Federal statutes to institute legal action in its own name against the person or entity responsible for interstate pollution problems;  provided, however, sixty (60) days before initiating legal action the Commission shall notify the Governor of the state in which the pollution source is located to allow that state an opportunity to initiate action in its own name.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">"Sec. 11.08. Without prejudice to any other remedy available to the Commission, or any Signatory State, any state which is materially and adversely affected by the pollution of the water of the Red River Basin by pollution originating in another Signatory State may institute a suit against any individual, corporation, partnership, or association, or against any Signatory State or political or governmental subdivision thereof, or against any officer, agency, department, bureau, district or instrumentality of or in any Signatory State contributing to such pollution in accordance with applicable Federal statutes.
