(a)  In this chapter unless the context otherwise requires "contract" and "agreement" are limited to those relating to the present or future sale of goods.  "Contract for sale" includes both a present sale of goods and a contract to sell goods at a future time.  A "sale" consists in the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price (Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&amp;Value=2.401">2.401</a>).
