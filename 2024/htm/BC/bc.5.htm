An adviser that is not a confirmer is not obligated to honor or give value for a presentation.  An adviser undertakes to the issuer and to the beneficiary accurately to advise the terms of the letter of credit, confirmation, amendment, or advice received by that person and undertakes to the beneficiary to check the apparent authenticity of the request to advise.  Even if the advice is inaccurate, the letter of credit, confirmation, or amendment is enforceable as issued.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  A person who notifies a transferee beneficiary of the terms of a letter of credit, confirmation, amendment, or advice has the rights and obligations of an adviser under Subsection (c).
