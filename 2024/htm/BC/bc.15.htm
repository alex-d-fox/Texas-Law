The person shall indicate in writing which if any of the answers contain trade secrets or confidential information.</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  Answers to interrogatories shall be submitted under a sworn certificate in such form as the related demand designates by a natural person having knowledge of the facts and circumstances relating to the preparation of the answers to the effect that all of the requested information in the possession, custody, control, or knowledge of the person to whom the demand is directed has been set forth fully and accurately.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(5)  Oral Examination.</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  The examination of any person pursuant to a demand for oral testimony duly served under this section shall be taken before any person authorized to administer oaths and affirmations by the laws of Texas or the United States.

Neither such person nor his or her counsel shall otherwise object to or refuse to answer any question or interrupt the oral examination.  If the person refuses to answer any question, the attorney general may petition the district court in the county where the examination is being conducted for an order compelling the person to answer the question.</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(F)  If and when the testimony has been fully transcribed, the person before whom the testimony was taken shall promptly transmit the transcript of the testimony to the witness and a copy of the transcript to the attorney general.  The witness shall have a reasonable opportunity to examine the transcript and make any changes in form or substance accompanied by a statement of the reasons for such changes.  The witness shall then sign and return the transcript, unless he or she is ill, cannot be found, refuses to sign, or in writing waives the signing.  If the witness does not sign the transcript within 15 days of receiving it, the person before whom the testimony has been given shall sign it and state on the record the reason, if known, for the witness's failure to sign.  The officer shall then certify on the transcript that the witness was duly sworn and that the transcript is a true record of the testimony given by the witness and promptly transmit a copy of the certified transcript to the attorney general.</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(G)  Upon request, the attorney general shall furnish a copy of the certified transcript to the witness.</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(H)  The witness shall be entitled to the same fees and mileage that are paid to witnesses in the district courts of Texas.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  Failure To Comply With Demand.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  Petition for Enforcement.
