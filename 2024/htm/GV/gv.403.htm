A contract may also apply to a tax or other amount owed by a person residing outside this state and not known by the agency referring the debt to have sufficient assets in this state to satisfy the debt to a political subdivision of this state, if the comptroller or another state official is required by law to collect the tax or other amount owed for the political subdivision.

If the debt to be collected consists of unpaid taxes, including any penalties, interest, or costs incurred in connection with the taxes, for which tax enforcement funds are available, the comptroller shall pay the compensation for services provided under the contract from those funds.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  An amount collected under a contract authorized by this section shall be deposited in a suspense account established for that purpose in the state treasury.

The person who owes the other amounts to be collected under the contract is liable for the collection fee.  The collection fee may be collected under the contract in addition to the other amounts due.  The amount of the collection fee is the amount provided by the contract, whether a specified amount or an amount contingent on the amount collected or other factor, for compensation of the person with whom the contract is made and any court costs or attorney's fees incurred in collecting the amount owed to this state.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  The comptroller shall require a person acting on behalf of the state under a contract authorized by this section to post a bond or other security in an amount the comptroller determines is sufficient to cover all revenue or other property of the state that is expected to come into the possession or control of the person in the course of providing the service.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  A person acting on behalf of the state under a contract authorized by this section does not exercise any of the sovereign power of this state, except that the person is an agent of this state for purposes of determining the priority of a claim that the person is attempting to collect under the contract with respect to the claims of other creditors.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  The comptroller may provide a person acting on behalf of the state under a contract authorized by this section with any confidential information in the custody of the comptroller relating to the debtor that is necessary to the collection of the claim and that the comptroller is not prohibited from sharing under an agreement with another state or the federal government.  A person acting on behalf of the state under a contract authorized by this section, and each employee or agent of the person, is subject to all prohibitions against the disclosure of confidential information obtained from the state in connection with the contract that apply to the comptroller or an employee of the comptroller.  A person acting on behalf of the state under a contract authorized by this section or an employee or agent of the person who discloses confidential information in violation of a prohibition made applicable to the person under this subsection is subject to the same sanctions and penalties that would apply to the comptroller or an employee of the comptroller for that disclosure.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  The comptroller shall require a person acting on behalf of the state under a contract authorized by this section to obtain and maintain insurance coverage adequate to provide reasonable coverage for damages negligently, recklessly, or intentionally caused by the person or the person's agent in the course of collecting a debt under the contract and to protect the state from any liability for those damages.  This state is not liable for and may not indemnify a person acting on behalf of the state under a contract authorized by this section for damages negligently, recklessly, or intentionally caused by the person or the person's agent in the course of collecting a tax or other amount under the contract.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  In addition to any other reasons that may be provided in the contract, a contract authorized under this section may be terminated if a person acting on behalf of the state under such contract, or an employee or agent of the person, is found to be in violation of the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, discloses confidential information to a person not authorized to receive it as provided in Subsection (i) of this section, or performs any act resulting in a final judgment for damages against this state.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(l)  The execution of a contract under this section does not accelerate the imposition of any penalty imposed or to be imposed on the tax or other amount to be collected under the contract.</p>

(a)  The comptroller shall conduct a study using comparable sales and generally accepted auditing and sampling techniques to determine the total taxable value of all property in each school district. The study shall determine the taxable value of all property and of each category of property in the district and the productivity value of all land that qualifies for appraisal on the basis of its productive capacity and for which the owner has applied for and received a productivity appraisal.  The comptroller shall make appropriate adjustments in the study to account for actions taken under Chapter <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&amp;Value=49">49</a>, Education Code.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(a-1)  The comptroller shall conduct a study:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  at least every two years in each school district for which the most recent study resulted in a determination by the comptroller that the school district's local value was valid; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  each year in a school district for which the most recent study resulted in a determination by the comptroller that the school district's local value was not valid.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(a-2)  If in any year the comptroller does not conduct a study, the school district's local value for that year is considered to be valid.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  In conducting the study, the comptroller shall determine the taxable value of property in each school district:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  using, if appropriate, samples selected through generally accepted sampling techniques;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  according to generally accepted standard valuation, statistical compilation, and analysis techniques;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  ensuring that different levels of appraisal on sold and unsold property do not adversely affect the accuracy of the study; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  ensuring that different levels of appraisal resulting from protests determined under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=41.43">41.43</a>, Tax Code, are appropriately adjusted in the study.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  If after conducting the study the comptroller determines that the local value for a school district is valid, the local value is presumed to represent taxable value for the school district.  In the absence of that presumption, taxable value for a school district is the state value for the school district determined by the comptroller under Subsections (a) and (b) unless the local value exceeds the state value, in which case the taxable value for the school district is the district's local value.  In determining whether the local value for a school district is valid, the comptroller shall use a margin of error that does not exceed five percent unless the comptroller determines that the size of the sample of properties necessary to make the determination makes the use of such a margin of error not feasible, in which case the comptroller may use a larger margin of error.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c-1)  This subsection applies only to a school district whose central administrative office is located in a county with a population of 10,000 or less and a total area of more than 6,000 square miles.
