The rules must require the commissioner to consider:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  whether resources are available after taking into account any ongoing board investigations, investigations under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&amp;Value=4007.053">4007.053</a>, and criminal prosecutions for which assistance is being provided;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  the seriousness of the alleged violation or violations in the case, including the severity of the harm and number of victims involved; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  the state's interest in the prosecution of a particular case and the availability of other methods of redress for the alleged violations, including the pursuit of a civil action.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  In response to a request for assistance under Subsection (e), the board may provide only those board employees or resources, if any, determined to be available for that case in accordance with Subsection (f). If a change in circumstances occurs after the time of the determination under Subsection (f), the commissioner may reconsider the commissioner's determination under that subsection and may increase or reduce the number of board employees or other resources to be made available for a case using the process established under Subsection (g).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  The attorney general, at least biennially, shall review a sample of criminal cases for which the board provided requested assistance to county or district attorneys under this section. The review must include an evaluation of the pre-referral determination of available resources to support each case being reviewed as required by Subsection (f) and any subsequent determination of those resources made by the commissioner as authorized under Subsection (h).  The attorney general may report any concerns the attorney general has in connection with the board's provision of assistance to the standing committee of each house of the legislature with primary jurisdiction over board matters.</p>
