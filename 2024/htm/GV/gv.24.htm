The board shall complete its work on the reapportionment and file its order with the secretary of state not later than August 31 of the same year.

If the court determines that good cause exists for the issuance of the subpoena, the court shall order compliance.  The court may modify the requirements of a subpoena that the court determines are unreasonable.  Failure to comply with the order of the district court is punishable as contempt.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  The board may provide for the compensation of subpoenaed witnesses.
