Section 207(o)(3)(A), not more than 480 hours of overtime credit that may be taken as compensatory leave under Subsection (c)(1).  An employee must be paid at the rate prescribed by Subsection (c)(2) for the number of overtime hours the employee works that cause the employee to exceed the amount of overtime credit the employee may accumulate.
