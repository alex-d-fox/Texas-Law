In making its final regulatory decision, the agency shall assess:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  all information submitted to it, whether quantitative or qualitative, consistent with generally accepted scientific standards;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  actual data where possible;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  assumptions that reflect actual impacts that the regulation is likely to impose.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  A person who submitted public comment in accordance with Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&amp;Value=2001.029">2001.029</a> may challenge the validity of a major environmental rule that is not proposed and adopted in accordance with the procedural requirements of this section by filing an action for declaratory judgment under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&amp;Value=2001.038">2001.038</a> not later than the 30th day after the effective date of the rule.
