If the final determination of the appeal decreases the property owner's tax liability to an amount less than the amount of taxes paid, each taxing unit shall refund to the property owner the difference between the amount of taxes paid and the amount of taxes for which the property owner is liable.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  A property owner may not appeal to the office if the taxes on the property subject to the appeal are delinquent.
