CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS:  COMPUTATION OF CONTINGENT FEE;  REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES.  (a)  The contract must establish the reasonable hourly rate for work performed by an attorney, law clerk, or paralegal who will perform legal or support services under the contract based on the reasonable and customary rate in the relevant locality for the type of work performed and on the relevant experience, demonstrated ability, and standard hourly billing rate, if any, of the person performing the work.  The contract may establish the reasonable hourly rate for one or more persons by name and may establish a rate schedule for work performed by unnamed persons.  The highest hourly rate for a named person or under a rate schedule may not exceed $1,000 an hour.  This subsection applies to subcontracted work performed by an attorney, law clerk, or paralegal who is not a contracting attorney or a partner, shareholder, or employee of a contracting attorney or law firm as well as to work performed by a contracting attorney or by a partner, shareholder, or employee of a contracting attorney or law firm.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  The contract must establish a base fee to be computed as follows.

Add the resulting amounts to obtain the base fee.  The computation of the base fee may not include hours or costs attributable to work performed by a person who is not a contracting attorney or a partner, shareholder, or employee of a contracting attorney or law firm.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  Subject to Subsection (d), the contingent fee is computed by multiplying the base fee by a multiplier.

The multiplier may not exceed four without prior approval by the legislature.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  In addition to establishing the method of computing the fee under Subsections (a), (b), and (c), the contract must limit the amount of the contingent fee to a stated percentage of the amount recovered.

The percentage limitation may not exceed 35 percent without prior approval by the legislature.  The contract must state that the amount of the contingent fee will not exceed the lesser of the stated percentage of the amount recovered or the amount computed under Subsections (a), (b), and (c).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  The contract also may:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  limit the amount of expenses that may be reimbursed;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  provide that the amount or payment of only part of the fee is contingent on the outcome of the matter for which the services were obtained, with the amount and payment of the remainder of the fee payable on a regular hourly rate basis without regard to the outcome of the matter.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  Except as provided by Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&amp;Value=2254.107">2254.107</a>, this section does not apply to a contingent fee contract for legal services:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  in which the expected amount to be recovered and the actual amount recovered do not exceed $100,000;  or</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  under which a series of recoveries is contemplated and the amount of each individual recovery is not expected to and does not exceed $100,000.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  This section applies to a contract described by Subsection (f) for each individual recovery under the contract that actually exceeds $100,000, and the contract must provide for computing the fee in accordance with this section for each individual recovery that actually exceeds $100,000.</p>
