They also recognize that optimum benefit from an acquisition of energy resources and facilities require systematic encouragement, guidance, and assistance from the party states on a cooperative basis.  It is the policy of the party states to undertake such cooperation on a continuing basis;  it is the purpose of this compact to provide the instruments and the framework for such a cooperative effort to improve the economy of the South and contribute to the individual and community well-being of the people of this region.</p><p class="center">ARTICLE II--THE BOARD</p><br /><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(a)  There is hereby created an agency of the party states to be known as the "Southern States Energy Board" (hereinafter referred to as the Board).
