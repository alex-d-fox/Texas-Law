For purposes of this subsection and Subsection (l), "business organization" means an investment pool or investment management firm under contract with an investing entity to invest or manage the entity's investment portfolio that has accepted authority granted by the entity under the contract to exercise investment discretion in regard to the investing entity's funds.  Nothing in this subsection relieves the investing entity of the responsibility for monitoring the investments made by the investing entity to determine that they are in compliance with the investment policy.  The qualified representative of the business organization offering to engage in an investment transaction with an investing entity shall execute a written instrument in a form acceptable to the investing entity and the business organization substantially to the effect that the business organization has:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  received and reviewed the investment policy of the entity; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  acknowledged that the business organization has implemented reasonable procedures and controls in an effort to preclude investment transactions conducted between the entity and the organization that are not authorized by the entity's investment policy, except to the extent that this authorization:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  is dependent on an analysis of the makeup of the entity's entire portfolio;</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  requires an interpretation of subjective investment standards; or</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(C)  relates to investment transactions of the entity that are not made through accounts or other contractual arrangements over which the business organization has accepted discretionary investment authority.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(l)  The investment officer of an entity may not acquire or otherwise obtain any authorized investment described in the investment policy of the investing entity from a business organization that has not delivered to the entity the instrument required by Subsection (k).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(m)  An investing entity other than a state agency, in conjunction with its annual financial audit, shall perform a compliance audit of management controls on investments and adherence to the entity's established investment policies.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(n)  Except as provided by Subsection (o), at least once every two years a state agency shall arrange for a compliance audit of management controls on investments and adherence to the agency's established investment policies.

Not later than January 1 of each even-numbered year a state agency shall report the results of the most recent audit performed under this subsection to the state auditor.
