The Bond Review Board has sole authority to modify or waive the required allocation levels.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(n)  In addition to any other loan originators selected by the department, the department shall authorize colonia self-help centers and any other community-based, nonprofit institutions considered appropriate by the board to originate loans on behalf of the department.
