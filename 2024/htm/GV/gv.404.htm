The state depository and the custodian of securities pledged by that state depository may not be the same bank or be owned by the same bank holding company.  The securities shall be held in trust by the custodian to secure funds deposited by the comptroller in the state depository pledging the securities.  On receipt of the securities, the custodian shall immediately, by book entry or otherwise, identify on its books and records the pledge of the securities and shall promptly issue and deliver to the comptroller controlled trust receipts for the securities pledged.  The security evidenced by the trust receipts is subject to inspection by the comptroller at any time.

When the pledged securities are deposited, the bank may apply book entry to the securities.
