If the order is determined to be a qualified domestic relations order, the public retirement system (or applicable carrier, if under the optional retirement program), shall pay benefits in accordance with the order.  If the order is determined not to be a qualified domestic relations order, the member or retiree or any alternate payee named in the order may appeal the administrative head's determination in the manner specified in Subsection (b) or the optional retirement program carrier's determination in the manner specified in Subsection (d) and may petition the court which issued the order to amend the order so that it will be qualified.  The court which issued the order or which would otherwise have jurisdiction over the matter has jurisdiction to amend the order so that it will be qualified even though all other matters incident to the action or proceeding have been fully and finally adjudicated.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  During any period in which the issue of whether a domestic relations order is a qualified domestic relations order is being determined by the agency administrative head, his designee, the board of trustees, a court of competent jurisdiction, optional retirement program carrier, or otherwise, the public retirement system shall separately account for the amounts, in this section referred to as the "segregated amounts," which would have been payable to the alternate payee during such period if the order had been determined to be a qualified domestic relations order.</p><p class="left"> </p><p class="center">Text of subsection as amended by Acts 2023, 88th Leg., R.S., Ch. 78 (S.B. <a target="new" href="http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/88R/billtext/html/SB00729F.HTM">729</a>), Sec. 1</p><br /><p class="left"> </p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  Except as provided by Subsection (k-1), if a domestic relations order is determined to be a qualified domestic relations order, then the public retirement system (or applicable carrier, if under the optional retirement program) shall pay the segregated amounts without interest to the person or persons entitled thereto and shall thereafter pay benefits pursuant to the order.</p><p class="left"> </p><p class="center">Text of subsection as amended by Acts 2023, 88th Leg., R.S., Ch. 1092 (S.B. <a target="new" href="http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/88R/billtext/html/SB01245F.HTM">1245</a>), Sec. 2</p><br /><p class="left"> </p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  Except as provided by Subsection (k-2), if a domestic relations order is determined to be a qualified domestic relations order, then the public retirement system (or applicable carrier, if under the optional retirement program) shall pay the segregated amounts without interest to the person or persons entitled thereto and shall thereafter pay benefits pursuant to the order.</p><p class="left"> </p><p class="center">Text of subsection as amended by Acts 2023, 88th Leg., R.S., Ch. 78 (S.B. <a target="new" href="http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/88R/billtext/html/SB00729F.HTM">729</a>), Sec. 1</p><br /><p class="left"> </p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  Except as provided by Subsection (k-1), if a domestic relations order is determined not to be a qualified domestic relations order or if within 18 months of the date a domestic relations order is received by the public retirement system (or applicable carrier, if under the optional retirement program) the issue as to whether such order is a qualified domestic relations order is not resolved, then the public retirement system (or applicable carrier, if under the optional retirement program) shall pay the segregated amounts without interest and shall thereafter pay benefits to the person or persons who would have been entitled to such amounts if there had been no order.
