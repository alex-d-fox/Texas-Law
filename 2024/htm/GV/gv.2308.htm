(a)  The council shall develop and recommend to the governor and report to the legislature a single strategic plan that establishes the framework for the budgeting and operation of the workforce development system, including school to careers and welfare to work components, administered by agencies represented on the council.  The council shall annually report to the governor and the legislature on the implementation of the strategic plan.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  The council shall engage in strategic planning by selecting or developing two types of performance measures as described by Subsections (c) and (d).  To the fullest extent possible, all measures must be selected from those already developed and approved before September 1, 2001, by one or more state agencies that administer workforce programs.  The council may develop a new measure only if the council:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  identifies a gap in accountability;  or</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  determines that at least one state agency administering a workforce program cannot report under the measures developed and approved before September 1, 2001.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  The first type of performance measure consists of formal measures identifying outcomes that are essentially consistent across all workforce programs.  Job placement rates, job retention rates, and wage rates may be included among those measures.  The council may develop or select not more than five formal measures.  The council shall develop or select each formal measure in consultation with the state agencies required to report under this subsection.

Employer participation rates, customer satisfaction levels, and educational attainment may be included among those measures.  The council shall develop or select each less formal measure with the approval of the governor and in consultation with the state agencies required to report under this subsection.  The Legislative Budget Board shall provide technical assistance to the council to ensure that the measures and associated reporting criteria are consistent with the state's performance budget and accounting system.  The council may exempt a state agency that administers a workforce program from any requirement to use a less formal measure.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  In addition to the other requirements of this chapter, the strategic plan recommended by the council must recognize and address literacy and basic education as activities that are critical to the well-being of individuals and the state without regard to whether the training and education is directed at preparing an individual for employment. </p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  The council shall include in the strategic plan goals, objectives, and performance measures for the workforce development system that involve programs of all state agencies that administer workforce programs.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  On approval of the plan by the governor, an agency administering a workforce program shall use the strategic plan to develop the agency's operational plan.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  The council shall include in the strategic plan long-range strategies developed by the council under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&amp;Value=2308.1015">2308.1015</a> to facilitate the seamless delivery of integrated workforce services in this state.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  The council shall include in the strategic plan the long-range strategies developed by the council under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&amp;Value=2308.1016">2308.1016</a> to facilitate the efficient delivery of integrated adult education and literacy services in this state.</p>
