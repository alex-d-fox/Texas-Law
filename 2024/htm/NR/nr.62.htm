(a)  The provisions of this chapter apply to counties that are located or border on the Gulf of Mexico and have within their boundaries beaches that are suitable for park purposes.  The suitability of a beach for park purposes is established conclusively when the commissioners court of the county makes a finding that the beach located within its boundaries, but not located within the boundaries of an incorporated city, is suitable for park purposes.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  As long as an island or peninsula is not accessible by a public road or common carrier ferry facility, the provisions of this chapter do not apply to that island or peninsula.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  The provisions of this chapter do not interfere with, preempt, or in any manner restrict or usurp the authority of the land office over state-owned beaches.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  The provisions of this chapter do not prohibit the creation of, or limit the lawful actions of, a beach park board of trustees of a home-rule city as provided in Chapter <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&amp;Value=306">306</a>, Local Government Code.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  The provisions of this chapter do not permit any interference with the right the public has under the provisions of Subchapter B, Chapter <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&amp;Value=61">61</a>, to the free and unrestricted use of, and to ingress and egress to, the area bordering on the Gulf of Mexico from mean low tide to the line of vegetation, as that term is defined in Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&amp;Value=61.001">61.001</a>.  A county, county official, or anyone acting under the authority of this chapter may not exercise any authority, contract out a right to exercise authority, or otherwise delegate authority beyond that specifically granted to it in Sections <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&amp;Value=61.122">61.122</a> through <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&amp;Value=61.128">61.128</a> over that area notwithstanding any of the specific provisions of this chapter.  The rights established in Subchapters B and D, Chapter <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&amp;Value=61">61</a>, are paramount over the rights or interests that might otherwise be created by the provisions of this chapter, and nothing in this chapter encroaches on those rights or upon land, or interests in land, that may ultimately be held subject to those rights.</p>
