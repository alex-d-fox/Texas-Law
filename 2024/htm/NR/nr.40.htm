This chapter may be cited as the Oil Spill Prevention and Response Act of 1991.</p>
<p class="left">Added by Acts 1991, 72nd Leg., ch. 10, Sec. 1, eff. March 28, 1991.</p>

<p class="left"><a name="40.002"></a><a name="50828.43830"></a></p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 40.002.  POLICY.  (a)  The legislature finds and declares that the preservation of the Texas coast is a matter of the highest urgency and priority.  It is the policy of this state to keep its coastal waters, rivers, lakes, estuaries, marshes, tidal flats, beaches, and public lands as pristine as possible, taking into account multiple use accommodations necessary to provide the broadest possible promotion of public and private interests.  Spills, discharges, and escapes of crude oil, petroleum, and other such substances resulting from their handling, storage, and transportation, particularly by vessel, endanger the coastal environment of the state, public and private property on the coast, and the well-being of those deriving their livelihood from marine-related activity in coastal waters.  The hazards posed by the handling, storage, and transportation of these substances in the coastal waters are contrary to the paramount interests of the state.  These state interests outweigh the economic burdens imposed under this chapter.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  The legislature finds and declares that the natural resources of the state and particularly those in the coastal waters of the state offer significant benefits to the citizens of Texas.  These natural resources are important for their existence and their recreational, aesthetic, and commercial value.  It is the policy of the state to protect these natural resources and to restore, rehabilitate, replace, and/or acquire the equivalent of these natural resources with all deliberate speed when they have been damaged.  The legislature finds and declares that it is difficult to assess the value of these natural resources and to quantify injury to natural resources at a reasonable cost.  The procedures and protocols utilized by the trustees must therefore consider the unique characteristics of each spill incident and the location of the natural resources affected.  It is the intent of the legislature that natural resource damage assessment methodologies be developed for the purpose of reasonably valuing the natural resources of the State of Texas in the event of an oil spill and that the state recover monetary damages or have actions commenced by the spiller as early as possible to expedite the restoration, rehabilitation, and/or replacement of injured natural resources.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  The legislature intends by this chapter to exercise the police power of the state to protect its coastal waters and adjacent shorelines by conferring upon the Commissioner of the General Land Office the power to:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  prevent spills and discharges of oil by requiring and monitoring preventive measures and response planning;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  provide for prompt response to abate and contain spills and discharges of oil and ensure the removal and cleanup of pollution from such spills and discharges;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  administer a fund to provide for funding these activities and to guarantee the prompt payment of certain reasonable claims resulting from spills and discharges of oil.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  The legislature declares that it is the intent of this chapter to support and complement the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-380)  and other federal law, specifically those provisions relating to the national contingency plan for cleanup of oil and hazardous substance spills and discharges, including provisions relating to the responsibilities of state agencies designated as natural resources trustees.  The legislature intends this chapter to be interpreted and implemented in a manner consistent with federal law.</p>

These procedures and protocols shall be adopted by rule, by the trustee agencies after negotiation, notice, and public comment, by June 1, 1994.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(5)  The administrative procedures and protocols shall include provisions which address:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  notification by the commissioner to all trustees in the event of an unauthorized discharge of oil;</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  coordination with and among trustees, spill response agencies, potentially responsible parties, experts in science and economics, and the public;

 the purpose of utilizing the expedited assessment procedure is to allow prompt initiation of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of an equivalent natural resource without lengthy analysis of the impact on affected natural resources;  this procedure shall, at a minimum, require that the trustees consider the following items:</p><p style="text-indent:31ex;" class="left">(aa)  the quantity and quality of oil discharged;</p><p style="text-indent:31ex;" class="left">(bb)  the time period during which coastal waters are affected by the oil and the physical extent of the impact;</p><p style="text-indent:31ex;" class="left">(cc)  the condition of the natural resources prior to the unauthorized discharge of oil;

The trustees may petition the commissioner for a longer period of time to complete the assessment by showing that the full impact of the discharge on the affected natural resources cannot be determined in 20 months.</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(E)  Any assessment generated by the trustees shall be reasonable and have a rational connection to the costs of conducting the assessment and of restoring, rehabilitating, replacing, and/or acquiring the equivalent of the injured natural resources.  The trustees shall ensure that the cost of any restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, or acquisition project shall not be disproportionate to the value of the natural resource before the injury.  The trustees shall utilize the most cost-effective method to achieve restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, or acquisition of an equivalent resource.  Furthermore, the trustees shall take into account the quality of the actions undertaken by the responsible party in response to the spill incident, including but not limited to containment and removal actions and protection and preservation of natural resources.</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(F)  The potentially responsible party shall make full payment within 60 days of the completion of the assessment by the trustees or, if mediation pursuant to this paragraph is conducted, within 60 days of the conclusion of the mediation.  To facilitate an expedited recovery of funds for natural resource restoration and to assist the trustees and the responsible party in the settlement of disputed natural resource damage assessments at their discretion and at any time, all disputed natural resource damage assessments shall be referred to mediation as a prerequisite to the jurisdiction of any court.  Results of the mediation and any settlement offers tendered during the mediation shall be treated as settlement negotiations for the purposes of admissibility in a court of law.  Either the trustees or the potentially responsible person may initiate the mediation process, after an assessment has been issued, by giving written notice to the commissioner, who shall give written notice to all parties.  One mediator shall be chosen by the trustees and one mediator shall be chosen by the responsible parties.  Within 45 days of the receipt of the assessment from the trustees, the mediators shall be designated.  The mediation shall end 135 days after the receipt of the assessment from the trustees.</p>
