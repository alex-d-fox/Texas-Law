(a)  An owner of the soil may acquire by assignment a lease which he executed on land subject to the Relinquishment Act, Subchapter <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&amp;Value=52.171">F</a>, Chapter <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&amp;Value=52">52</a> of this code;  however, such an assignment is subject to the terms of this section.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  When an owner of the soil seeks an assignment under Subsection (a) of this section, both the current lessee and the owner of the soil should notify the General Land Office of the proposed assignment.  This notification must include proof of the consideration to be paid for the assignment.  The land commissioner may then approve the assignment;  if the commissioner does approve it, then both the current lessee and the owner of the soil will receive written notice of this approval.

Any conflict of interest must be resolved by putting the interests of the state before the interests of the owner of the soil.

Such an action or proceeding shall be filed in a district court in Travis County.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  A penalty of 10 percent shall be imposed on any sums due the state because a surface owner breaches a fiduciary duty.  This penalty shall be applied only to amounts owed as a result of breaches occurring on and after the effective date of this subsection.
