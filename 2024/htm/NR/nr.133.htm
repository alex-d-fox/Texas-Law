The Legislature of the State of Texas finds that:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  protection of the public good by requiring safety devices for certain aggregate quarries and pits and regulation of public access to such aggregate quarries and pits, with reasonable, fair, and certain laws, accompanied by civil penalties for failure to obey such laws, are essential to protect the public good and welfare;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  to carry out the stated purpose of this Act, a method must be provided to secure usable information concerning the definition, existence of, operation of, and abandonment of aggregate quarries and pits;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  to provide for a centralized, easily understood method of requiring safety devices and the administration thereof by one agency of this state to the exclusion of any other governmental entity is essential to the smooth workings of any law having statewide impact.</p>
