vegetation when restored during reclamation, except if topsoil is of insufficient quantity or of poor quality for sustaining vegetation and if other strata can be shown to be as suitable for vegetation requirements, then the operator shall remove, segregate, and preserve in a like manner the other strata which is best able to support vegetation, provided that the requirements of this

or runoff outside the permit area above natural levels under seasonal flow conditions;</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(C)  removing temporary or large siltation structures from drainways consistent with good water conservation practices after disturbed areas are revegetated and stabilized;  or</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(D)  other actions as the commission may prescribe pursuant to its rules;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(9)  stabilize any waste piles;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(10)  refrain from surface mining in proximity to active and abandoned underground mines in which mining would cause breakthroughs or would endanger the health or safety of miners;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(11)  incorporate with respect to the use of impoundments for the disposal of mine wastes, processing wastes, or other liquid or solid wastes current engineering practices for the design and construction of water retention facilities which, at a minimum, shall be compatible with the requirements of Section 6.0731, Water Code, and applicable federal laws, ensure that leachate will not pollute surface or groundwater, and locate impoundments so as not to endanger public health and safety should failure occur;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(12)  ensure that all debris, toxic materials, or materials constituting a fire hazard are treated or disposed of in a manner designed to prevent contamination of ground or surface water or combustion;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(13)  ensure that any explosives are used only in accordance with existing state and federal law and rules promulgated by the commission;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(14)  ensure that all reclamation efforts proceed as contemporaneously as practicable with the surface mining operations;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(15)  ensure that construction, maintenance, and postmining conditions of access roads into and across the site of operations will minimize erosion and siltation, pollution of air and water, damage to fish or wildlife or their habitat, or public or private property, provided that the commission may permit the retention after mining of certain access roads if compatible with the approved reclamation plan;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(16)  refrain from the construction of roads or other access ways up a streambed or drainage channel or in proximity to such channel where such construction would seriously alter the normal flow of water;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(17)  establish on all affected land, where required in the approved reclamation plan, a diverse vegetative cover native to the affected land where vegetation existed prior to mining and capable of self-regeneration and plant succession equal in extent of cover to the natural vegetation of the area, except that introduced species may be used in the revegetation process where desirable or necessary to achieve the approved reclamation plan;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(18)  assume responsibility for successful revegetation for a period of four years beyond the first year in which the vegetation has been successfully established as evidenced by the land being used as anticipated in the reclamation plan;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(19)  ensure with respect to permanent impoundments of water as part of the approved reclamation plan that:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  the size of the impoundment and the availability of water are adequate for its intended purpose;</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  the impoundment dam construction will meet the requirements of Section 6.0731, Water Code, and applicable federal laws;</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(C)  the quality of impounded water will be suitable on a permanent basis for its intended use and the discharges from the impoundment will not degrade the water quality in the receiving stream;</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(D)  final grading will provide adequate safety and access for anticipated water users;  and</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(E)  the water impoundments will not result in the diminution of the quality or quantity of water utilized by adjacent or surrounding landowners for agricultural, industrial, recreational, or domestic uses;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;"
