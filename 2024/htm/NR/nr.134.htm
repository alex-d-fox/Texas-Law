The legislature finds and declares that:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the Congress of the United States has enacted the federal Act, which provides for the establishment of a nationwide program to regulate surface coal mining and reclamation and which vests exclusive authority in the Department of the Interior over the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation in the United States;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  Section 101 of the federal Act contains the finding by Congress that because of the diversity in terrain, climate, biologic, chemical, and other physical conditions in areas subject to mining operations, the primary governmental responsibility for developing, authorizing, issuing, and enforcing regulations for surface mining and reclamation operations subject to that Act should rest with the states;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  Section 503 of the federal Act provides that each state may assume and retain exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations in that state by obtaining approval of a state program of regulation that demonstrates that the state is able to carry out the provisions and meet the purposes of that Act;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  Section 503 of the federal Act further provides that a state wishing to assume exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations in the state must have a state law that provides for the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations in accordance with that Act;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(5)  this state wishes to assume exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations in the state under the federal Act.</p>

It is the purpose of this chapter:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  to prevent adverse effects to society and the environment from unregulated surface coal mining operations as defined by this chapter;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  to assure that the rights of surface landowners and other persons with a legal interest in the land or appurtenances to the land are protected from unregulated surface coal mining operations;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  to assure that surface coal mining operations are conducted in a manner that will prevent unreasonable degradation of land and water resources;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  to assure that reclamation of all land on which surface coal mining takes place occurs as contemporaneously as practicable with the surface coal mining, recognizing that extracting coal by responsible mining operations is an essential and beneficial economic activity;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(5)  to assure that the coal supply essential to this state's energy requirements and to its economic and social well-being is provided and to strike a balance between environmental protection and agricultural productivity and this state's need for coal as an essential source of energy;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(6)  to promote the reclamation of mined areas left without adequate reclamation before the enactment of the federal Act and that continue, in their unreclaimed condition, substantially to degrade the quality of the environment, prevent or damage the beneficial use of land or water resources, or endanger the health or safety of the public.</p>
