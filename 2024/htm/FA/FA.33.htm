The defense does not apply if the physician is shown to have had independent knowledge of the minor's actual age or identity or failed to use due diligence in determining the minor's age or identity.  In this subsection, "defense" has the meaning and application assigned by Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&amp;Value=2.03">2.03</a>, Penal Code.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  In relation to the trial of an offense under this section in which the conduct charged involves a conclusion made by the physician under Subsection (a)(3)(A), the defendant may seek a hearing before the Texas Medical Board on whether the physician's conduct was necessary because of a medical emergency.  The findings of the Texas Medical Board under this subsection are admissible on that issue in the trial of the defendant.  Notwithstanding any other reason for a continuance provided under the Code of Criminal Procedure or other law, on motion of the defendant, the court shall delay the beginning of the trial for not more than 30 days to permit a hearing under this subsection to take place.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  A physician shall use due diligence to determine that any woman on which the physician performs an abortion who claims to have reached the age of majority or to have had the disabilities of minority removed has, in fact, reached the age of majority or has had the disabilities of minority removed. </p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  For the purposes of this section, "due diligence" includes requesting proof of identity and age described by Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&amp;Value=2.005">2.005</a>(b) or a copy of the court order removing disabilities of minority.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(l)  If proof of identity and age cannot be provided, the physician shall provide information on how to obtain proof of identity and age. If the woman is subsequently unable to obtain proof of identity and age and the physician chooses to perform the abortion, the physician shall document that proof of identity and age was not obtained and report to the Department of State Health Services that proof of identity and age was not obtained for the woman on whom the abortion was performed.  The department shall report annually to the legislature regarding the number of abortions performed without proof of identity and age.</p>
