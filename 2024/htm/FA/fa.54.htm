Notice shall be given to the child and, if they can be found, to his parents, guardian, or custodian.  Prior to the commencement of the hearing, the court shall inform the parties of the child's right to counsel and to appointed counsel if they are indigent and of the child's right to remain silent with respect to any allegations of delinquent conduct, conduct indicating a need for supervision, or conduct that violates an order of probation imposed by a juvenile court.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b-1)  Unless the court finds that the appointment of counsel is not feasible due to exigent circumstances, the court shall appoint counsel within a reasonable time before the first detention hearing is held to represent the child at that hearing.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  At the detention hearing, the court may consider written reports from probation officers, professional court employees, guardians ad litem appointed under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&amp;Value=51.11">51.11</a>(d), or professional consultants in addition to the testimony of witnesses. Prior to the detention hearing, the court shall provide the attorney for the child with access to all written matter to be considered by the court in making the detention decision.  The court may order counsel not to reveal items to the child or the child's parent, guardian, or guardian ad litem if such disclosure would materially harm the treatment and rehabilitation of the child or would substantially decrease the likelihood of receiving information from the same or similar sources in the future.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  A detention hearing may be held without the presence of the child's parents if the court has been unable to locate them.  If no parent or guardian is present, the court shall appoint counsel or a guardian ad litem for the child, subject to the requirements of Subsection (b-1).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  At the conclusion of the hearing, the court shall order the child released from detention unless it finds that:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  he is likely to abscond or be removed from the jurisdiction of the court;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  suitable supervision, care, or protection for him is not being provided by a parent, guardian, custodian, or other person;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  he has no parent, guardian, custodian, or other person able to return him to the court when required;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  he may be dangerous to himself or may threaten the safety of the public if released;  or</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(5)  he has previously been found to be a delinquent child or has previously been convicted of a penal offense punishable by a term in jail or prison and is likely to commit an offense if released.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  Unless otherwise agreed in the memorandum of understanding under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&amp;Value=37.011">37.011</a>, Education Code, a release may be conditioned on requirements reasonably necessary to insure the child's appearance at later proceedings, but the conditions of the release must be in writing and a copy furnished to the child.  In a county with a population greater than 125,000, if a child being released under this section is expelled under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&amp;Value=37.007">37.007</a>, Education Code, the release shall be conditioned on the child's attending a juvenile justice alternative education program pending a deferred prosecution or formal court disposition of the child's case.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  No statement made by the child at the detention hearing shall be admissible against the child at any other hearing.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  A detention order extends to the conclusion of the disposition hearing, if there is one, but in no event for more than 10 working days.  Further detention orders may be made following subsequent detention hearings.  The initial detention hearing may not be waived but subsequent detention hearings may be waived in accordance with the requirements of Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&amp;Value=51.09">51.09</a>. Each subsequent detention order shall extend for no more than 10 working days, except that in a county that does not have a certified juvenile detention facility, as described by Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&amp;Value=51.12">51.12</a>(a)(3), each subsequent detention order shall extend for no more than 15 working days.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  A child in custody may be detained for as long as 10 days without the hearing described in Subsection (a) of this section if:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  a written request for shelter in detention facilities pending arrangement of transportation to his place of residence in another state or country or another county of this state is voluntarily executed by the child not later than the next working day after he was taken into custody;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  the request for shelter contains:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  a statement by the child that he voluntarily agrees to submit himself to custody and detention for a period of not longer than 10 days without a detention hearing;</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  an allegation by the person detaining the child that the child has left his place of residence in another state or country or another county of this state, that he is in need of shelter, and that an effort is being made to arrange transportation to his place of residence;  and</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(C)  a statement by the person detaining the child that he has advised the child of his right to demand a detention hearing under Subsection (a) of this section;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  the request is signed by the juvenile court judge to evidence his knowledge of the fact that the child is being held in detention.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  The request for shelter may be revoked by the child at any time, and on such revocation, if further detention is necessary, a detention hearing shall be held not later than the next working day in accordance with Subsections (a) through (g) of this section.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  Notwithstanding anything in this title to the contrary, the child may sign a request for shelter without the concurrence of an adult specified in Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&amp;Value=51.09">51.09</a> of this code.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(l)  The juvenile board may appoint a referee to conduct the detention hearing.  The referee shall be an attorney licensed to practice law in this state.  Such payment or additional payment as may be warranted for referee services shall be provided from county funds.  Before commencing the detention hearing, the referee shall inform the parties who have appeared that they are entitled to have the hearing before the juvenile court judge or a substitute judge authorized by Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&amp;Value=51.04">51.04</a>(f). If a party objects to the referee conducting the detention hearing, an authorized judge shall conduct the hearing within 24 hours.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the referee shall transmit written findings and recommendations to the juvenile court judge or substitute judge.  The juvenile court judge or substitute judge shall adopt, modify, or reject the referee's recommendations not later than the next working day after the day that the judge receives the recommendations.  Failure to act within that time results in release of the child by operation of law.  A recommendation that the child be released operates to secure the child's immediate release, subject to the power of the juvenile court judge or substitute judge to reject or modify that recommendation.  The effect of an order detaining a child shall be computed from the time of the hearing before the referee.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(m)  The detention hearing required in this section may be held in the county of the designated place of detention where the child is being held even though the designated place of detention is outside the county of residence of the child or the county in which the alleged delinquent conduct, conduct indicating a need for supervision, or probation violation occurred.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(n)  An attorney appointed by the court under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&amp;Value=51.10">51.10</a>(c) because a determination was made under this section to detain a child who was not represented by an attorney may request on behalf of the child and is entitled to a de novo detention hearing under this section.  The attorney must make the request not later than the 10th working day after the date the attorney is appointed.  The hearing must take place not later than the second working day after the date the attorney filed a formal request with the court for a hearing.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(o)  The court or referee shall find whether there is probable cause to believe that a child taken into custody without an arrest warrant or a directive to apprehend has engaged in delinquent conduct, conduct indicating a need for supervision, or conduct that violates an order of probation imposed by a juvenile court.  The court or referee must make the finding within 48 hours, including weekends and holidays, of the time the child was taken into custody.  The court or referee may make the finding on any reasonably reliable information without regard to admissibility of that information under the Texas Rules of Evidence.  A finding of probable cause is required to detain a child after the 48th hour after the time the child was taken into custody.  If a court or referee finds probable cause, additional findings of probable cause are not required in the same cause to authorize further detention.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(p)  If a child is detained in a county jail or other facility as provided by Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&amp;Value=51.12">51.12</a>(l) and the child is not released under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&amp;Value=53.02">53.02</a>(f), a detention hearing without a jury shall be held promptly, but not later than the 24th hour, excluding weekends and holidays, after the time the child is taken into custody.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(q)  If a child has not been released under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&amp;Value=53.02">53.02</a> or this section and a petition has not been filed under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&amp;Value=53.04">53.04</a> or <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&amp;Value=54.05">54.05</a> concerning the child, the court shall order the child released from detention not later than:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the 30th working day after the date the initial detention hearing is held, if the child is alleged to have engaged in conduct constituting a capital felony, an aggravated controlled substance felony, or a felony of the first degree;  or</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  the 15th working day after the date the initial detention hearing is held, if the child is alleged to have engaged in conduct constituting an offense other than an offense listed in Subdivision (1) or conduct that violates an order of probation imposed by a juvenile court.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(q-1)  The juvenile board may impose an earlier deadline than the specified deadlines for filing petitions under Subsection (q) and may specify the consequences of not filing a petition by the deadline the juvenile board has established.  The juvenile board may authorize but not require the juvenile court to release a respondent from detention for failure of the prosecutor to file a petition by the juvenile board's deadline.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(r)  On the conditional release of a child from detention by judicial order under Subsection (f), the court, referee, or detention magistrate may order that the child's parent, guardian, or custodian present in court at the detention hearing engage in acts or omissions specified by the court, referee, or detention magistrate that will assist the child in complying with the conditions of release.  The order must be in writing and a copy furnished to the parent, guardian, or custodian.  An order entered under this subsection may be enforced as provided by Chapter <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&amp;Value=61">61</a>.</p>
