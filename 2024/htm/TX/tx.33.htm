(a)  A delinquent tax incurs a penalty of six percent of the amount of the tax for the first calendar month it is delinquent plus one percent for each additional month or portion of a month the tax remains unpaid prior to July 1 of the year in which it becomes delinquent.  However, a tax delinquent on July 1 incurs a total penalty of twelve percent of the amount of the delinquent tax without regard to the number of months the tax has been delinquent.  A delinquent tax continues to incur the penalty provided by this subsection as long as the tax remains unpaid, regardless of whether a judgment for the delinquent tax has been rendered.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  If a person who exercises the split-payment option provided by Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=31.03">31.03</a> of this code fails to make the second payment before July 1, the second payment is delinquent and incurs a penalty of twelve percent of the amount of unpaid tax.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  A delinquent tax accrues interest at a rate of one percent for each month or portion of a month the tax remains unpaid.

A copy of each notice shall be filed with the clerk of the court together with an affidavit by the tax collector or by the taxing unit's attorney attesting to the fact and date of mailing of the notice.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  In addition to the notice required by Subsection (g), the taxing unit shall provide notice by publication and by posting to all persons with a property interest in the parcel subject to foreclosure.

When returned and filed in the trial court, an  affidavit of the editor or publisher of the newspaper attesting to the date of publication, together with a printed copy of the notice as published, is sufficient proof of publication under this subsection.  If a newspaper is not published in the county in which the parcel is located, publication in an otherwise  qualifying newspaper published in an adjoining county is sufficient.  The maximum fee for publishing the citation shall be the lowest published word or line rate of that newspaper for classified advertising.  The notice by posting shall be in the English language and given by posting a copy of the notice at the courthouse door of the county in which the foreclosure is pending not less than the 45th day before the date on which the taxing unit's petition is scheduled to be heard.  Proof of the posting of the notice shall be made by affidavit of the attorney for the taxing unit, or of the person posting it.  If the publication of the notice cannot be had for the maximum fee established in this subsection, and that fact is supported by the affidavit of the attorney for the taxing unit, the notice by posting under this subsection is sufficient.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  The notice required by Subsections (g) and (h) must include:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  a statement that foreclosure proceedings have been commenced and the date the petition was filed;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  a legal description, tax account number, and, if known, a street address for the parcel in which the addressee owns a property interest;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  the name of the person to whom the notice is addressed and the name of each other person who, according to the title search, has an interest in the parcel in which the addressee owns a property interest;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  the date, time, and place of the scheduled hearing on the petition;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(5)  a statement that the recipient of the notice may lose whatever property interest the recipient owns in the parcel as a result of the hearing and any subsequent tax sale;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(6)  a statement explaining how a person may contest the taxing unit's petition as provided by Subsection (j) and that a person's interest in the parcel may be preserved by paying all delinquent taxes, penalties, interest, attorney's fees, and court costs before the date of the scheduled hearing on the petition;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(7)  the name, address, and telephone number of the taxing unit and the taxing unit's attorney of record; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(8)  the name of each other taxing unit that imposes taxes on the parcel, together with a notice that any taxing unit may intervene without further notice and set up its claims for delinquent taxes.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  A person claiming a property interest in a parcel subject to foreclosure may contest a taxing unit's petition by filing with the clerk of the court a written response to the petition not later than the seventh day before the date scheduled for hearing on the petition and specifying in the response any affirmative defense of the person.  A copy of the response must be served on the taxing unit's attorney of record in the manner required by Rule 21a, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.  The taxing unit is entitled on request to a continuance of the hearing if a written response filed to a notice of the hearing contains an affirmative defense or requests affirmative relief against the taxing unit.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  Before entry of a judgment under this section, a taxing unit may remove a parcel erroneously included in the petition and may take a voluntary nonsuit as to one or more parcels of property without prejudicing its action against the remaining parcels.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(l)  If before the hearing on a taxing unit's petition the taxing unit discovers a deficiency in the provision of notice under this section, the taxing unit shall take reasonable steps in good faith to correct the deficiency before the hearing.  A notice provided by Subsections (g)-(i) is in lieu of citation issued and served under Rule 117a, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.  Regardless of the manner in which notice under this section is given, an attorney ad litem may not be appointed for a person with an interest in a parcel with delinquent taxes, penalties, interest, and attorney's fees against the parcel in an amount that exceeds the parcel's appraised value.
