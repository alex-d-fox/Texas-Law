The program contemplates a topic-by-topic revision of the state's general and permanent statute law without substantive change.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  Consistent with the objectives of the statutory revision program, the purpose of this code is to make the general and permanent state tax laws more accessible and understandable by:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  rearranging the statutes into a more logical order;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  employing a format and numbering system designed to facilitate citation of the law and to accommodate future expansion of the law;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  eliminating repealed, duplicative, unconstitutional, expired, executed, and other ineffective provisions;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  restating the law in modern American English to the greatest extent possible.</p>
