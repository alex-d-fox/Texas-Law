(a)  By July 25, the chief appraiser shall prepare and certify to the assessor for each taxing unit participating in the district that part of the appraisal roll for the district that lists the property taxable by the unit.  The part certified to the assessor is the appraisal roll for the unit.  The chief appraiser shall consult with the assessor for each taxing unit and notify each unit in writing by April 1 of the form in which the roll will be provided to each unit.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(a-1)  If by July 20 the appraisal review board for an appraisal district has not approved the appraisal records for the district as required under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=41.12">41.12</a>, the chief appraiser shall not later than July 25 prepare and certify to the assessor for each taxing unit participating in the district an estimate of the taxable value of property in that taxing unit.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  When a chief appraiser submits an appraisal roll for county taxes to a county assessor-collector, the chief appraiser also shall certify the appraisal district appraisal roll to the comptroller.  However, the comptroller by rule may provide for submission of only a summary of the appraisal roll.  The chief appraiser shall certify the district appraisal roll or the summary of that roll in the form and manner prescribed by the comptroller's rule.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  The chief appraiser shall prepare and certify to the assessor for each taxing unit a listing of those properties which are taxable by that unit but which are under protest and therefore not included on the appraisal roll approved by the appraisal review board and certified by the chief appraiser.  This listing shall include the appraised market value, productivity value (if applicable), and taxable value as determined by the appraisal district and shall also include the market value, taxable value, and productivity value (if applicable) as claimed by the property owner filing the protest if available.  If the property owner does not claim a value and the appraised value of the property in the current year is equal to or less than its value in the preceding year, the listing shall include a reasonable estimate of the market value, taxable value, and productivity value (if applicable) that would be assigned to the property if the taxpayer's claim is upheld.  If the property owner does not claim a value and the appraised value of the property is higher than its appraised value in the preceding year, the listing shall include the appraised market value, productivity value (if applicable) and taxable value of the property in the preceding year, except that if there is a reasonable likelihood that the appraisal review board will approve a lower appraised value for the property than its appraised value in the preceding year, the chief appraiser shall make a reasonable estimate of the taxable value that would be assigned to the property if the property owner's claim is upheld.  The taxing unit shall use the lower value for calculations as prescribed in Sections <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=26.04">26.04</a> and <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=26.041">26.041</a> of this code.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  The chief appraiser shall prepare and certify to the assessor for each taxing unit a list of those properties of which the chief appraiser has knowledge that are reasonably likely to be taxable by that unit but that are not included on the appraisal roll certified to the assessor under Subsection (a) or included on the listing certified to the assessor under Subsection (c).  The chief appraiser shall include on the list for each property the market value, appraised value, and kind and amount of any partial exemptions as determined by the appraisal district for the preceding year and a reasonable estimate of the market value, appraised value, and kind and amount of any partial exemptions for the current year.  Until the property is added to the appraisal roll, the assessor for the taxing unit shall include each property on the list in the calculations prescribed by Sections <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=26.04">26.04</a> and <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=26.041">26.041</a>, and for that purpose shall use the lower market value, appraised value, or taxable value, as appropriate, included on or computed using the information included on the list for the property.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  Except as provided by Subsection (f), not later than April 30, the chief appraiser shall prepare and certify to the assessor for each county, municipality, and school district participating in the appraisal district an estimate of the taxable value of property in that taxing unit.  The chief appraiser shall assist each county, municipality, and school district in determining values of property in that taxing unit for the taxing unit's budgetary purposes.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  Subsection (e) does not apply to a county or municipality that notifies the chief appraiser that the county or municipality elects not to receive the estimate or assistance described by that subsection.</p>

(a)  The governing body of each taxing unit shall adopt a tax rate for the current tax year and shall notify the assessor for the taxing unit of the rate adopted.  The governing body must adopt a tax rate before the later of September 30 or the 60th day after the date the certified appraisal roll is received by the taxing unit, except that the governing body must adopt a tax rate that exceeds the voter-approval tax rate not later than the 71st day before the next uniform election date prescribed by Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=EL&amp;Value=41.001">41.001</a>, Election Code, that occurs in November of that year.  The tax rate consists of two components, each of which must be approved separately.  The components are:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  for a taxing unit other than a school district, the rate that, if applied to the total taxable value, will impose the total amount described by Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=26.04">26.04</a>(e)(3)(C), less any amount of additional sales and use tax revenue that will be used to pay debt service, or, for a school district, the rate calculated under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&amp;Value=44.004">44.004</a>(c)(5)(A)(ii)(b), Education Code; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  the rate that, if applied to the total taxable value, will impose the amount of taxes needed to fund maintenance and operation expenditures of the taxing unit for the next year.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  A taxing unit may not impose property taxes in any year until the governing body has adopted a tax rate for that year, and the annual tax rate must be set by ordinance, resolution, or order, depending on the method prescribed by law for adoption of a law by the governing body. The vote on the ordinance, resolution, or order setting the tax rate must be separate from the vote adopting the budget.  For a taxing unit other than a school district, the vote on the ordinance, resolution, or order setting a tax rate that exceeds the no-new-revenue tax rate must be a record vote, and at least 60 percent of the members of the governing body must vote in favor of the ordinance, resolution, or order.  For a school district, the vote on the ordinance, resolution, or order setting a tax rate that exceeds the rate calculated as provided by Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&amp;Value=44.004">44.004</a>(c)(5)(A)(ii), Education Code, must be a record vote, and at least 60 percent of the members of the governing body must vote in favor of the ordinance, resolution, or order.  A motion to adopt an ordinance, resolution, or order setting a tax rate that exceeds the no-new-revenue tax rate must be made in the following form: "I move that the property tax rate be increased by the adoption of a tax rate of (specify tax rate), which is effectively a (insert percentage by which the proposed tax rate exceeds the no-new-revenue tax rate) percent increase in the tax rate."  If the ordinance, resolution, or order sets a tax rate that, if applied to the total taxable value, will impose an amount of taxes to fund maintenance and operation expenditures of the taxing unit that exceeds the amount of taxes imposed for that purpose in the preceding year, the taxing unit must:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  include in the ordinance, resolution, or order in type larger than the type used in any other portion of the document:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  the following statement: "THIS TAX RATE WILL RAISE MORE TAXES FOR MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS THAN LAST YEAR'S TAX RATE."; and</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  if the tax rate exceeds the no-new-revenue maintenance and operations rate, the following statement: "THE TAX RATE WILL EFFECTIVELY BE RAISED BY (INSERT PERCENTAGE BY WHICH THE TAX RATE EXCEEDS THE NO-NEW-REVENUE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS RATE) PERCENT AND WILL RAISE TAXES FOR MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS ON A $100,000 HOME BY APPROXIMATELY $(Insert amount)."; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  include on the home page of the Internet website of the taxing unit:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  the following statement: "(Insert name of taxing unit) ADOPTED A TAX RATE THAT WILL RAISE MORE TAXES FOR MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS THAN LAST YEAR'S TAX RATE"; and</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  if the tax rate exceeds the no-new-revenue maintenance and operations rate, the following statement: "THE TAX RATE WILL EFFECTIVELY BE RAISED BY (INSERT PERCENTAGE BY WHICH THE TAX RATE EXCEEDS THE NO-NEW-REVENUE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS RATE) PERCENT AND WILL RAISE TAXES FOR MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS ON A $100,000 HOME BY APPROXIMATELY $(Insert amount)."</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  If the governing body of a taxing unit does not adopt a tax rate before the date required by Subsection (a), the tax rate for the taxing unit for that tax year is the lower of the no-new-revenue tax rate calculated for that tax year or the tax rate adopted by the taxing unit for the preceding tax year.  A tax rate established by this subsection is treated as an adopted tax rate.  Before the fifth day after the establishment of a tax rate by this subsection, the governing body of the taxing unit must ratify the applicable tax rate in the manner required by Subsection (b).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  The governing body of a taxing unit other than a school district may not adopt a tax rate that exceeds the lower of the voter-approval tax rate or the no-new-revenue tax rate calculated as provided by this chapter until the governing body has held a public hearing on the proposed tax rate and has otherwise complied with Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=26.06">26.06</a> and Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=26.065">26.065</a>.

It is a defense in an action for an injunction under this subsection that the failure to comply was in good faith.  An action to enjoin the collection of taxes must be filed not later than the 15th day after the date the taxing unit adopts a tax rate.  A property owner is not required to pay the taxes imposed by a taxing unit on the owner's property while an action filed by the property owner to enjoin the collection of taxes imposed by the taxing unit on the owner's property is pending.  If the property owner pays the taxes and subsequently prevails in the action, the property owner is entitled to a refund of the taxes paid, together with reasonable attorney's fees and court costs.  The property owner is not required to apply to the collector for the taxing unit to receive the refund.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e-1)  The governing body of a taxing unit that imposes an additional sales and use tax may not adopt the component of the tax rate of the taxing unit described by Subsection (a)(1) of this section until the chief financial officer or the auditor for the taxing unit submits to the governing body of the taxing unit a written certification that the amount of additional sales and use tax revenue that will be used to pay debt service has been deducted from the total amount described by Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=26.04">26.04</a>(e)(3)(C) as required by Subsection (a)(1) of this section.  The comptroller shall prescribe the form of the certification required by this subsection and the manner in which it is required to be submitted.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  Except as required by the law under which an obligation was created, the governing body may not apply any tax revenues generated by the rate described in Subsection (a)(1) of this section for any purpose other than the retirement of debt.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), the governing body of a school district that elects to adopt a tax rate before the adoption of a budget for the fiscal year that begins in the current tax year may adopt a tax rate for the current tax year before receipt of the certified appraisal roll for the school district if the chief appraiser of the appraisal district in which the school district participates has certified to the assessor for the school district an estimate of the taxable value of property in the school district as provided by Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=26.01">26.01</a>(e).
