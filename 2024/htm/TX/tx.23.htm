(a)  Except as otherwise provided by this chapter, all taxable property is appraised at its market value as of January 1.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  The market value of property shall be determined by the application of generally accepted appraisal methods and techniques.  If the appraisal district determines the appraised value of a property using mass appraisal standards, the mass appraisal standards must comply with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice.  The same or similar appraisal methods and techniques shall be used in appraising the same or similar kinds of property.  However, each property shall be appraised based upon the individual characteristics that affect the property's market value, and all available evidence that is specific to the value of the property shall be taken into account in determining the property's market value.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  Notwithstanding Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=1.04">1.04</a>(7)(C), in determining the market value of a residence homestead, the chief appraiser may not exclude from consideration the value of other residential property that is in the same neighborhood as the residence homestead being appraised and would otherwise be considered in appraising the residence homestead because the other residential property:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  was sold at a foreclosure sale conducted in any of the three years preceding the tax year in which the residence homestead is being appraised and was comparable at the time of sale based on relevant characteristics with other residence homesteads in the same neighborhood; or</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  has a market value that has declined because of a declining economy.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  The market value of a residence homestead shall be determined solely on the basis of the property's value as a residence homestead, regardless of whether the residential use of the property by the owner is considered to be the highest and best use of the property.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  Notwithstanding any provision of this subchapter to the contrary, if the appraised value of property in a tax year is lowered under Subtitle F, the appraised value of the property as finally determined under that subtitle is considered to be the appraised value of the property for that tax year.  In the next tax year in which the property is appraised, the chief appraiser may not increase the appraised value of the property unless the increase by the chief appraiser is reasonably supported by clear and convincing evidence when all of the reliable and probative evidence in the record is considered as a whole.  If the appraised value is finally determined in a protest under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=41.41">41.41</a>(a)(2) or an appeal under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=42.26">42.26</a>, the chief appraiser may satisfy the requirement to reasonably support by clear and convincing evidence an increase in the appraised value of the property in the next tax year in which the property is appraised by presenting evidence showing that the inequality in the appraisal of property has been corrected with regard to the properties that were considered in determining the value of the subject property.  The burden of proof is on the chief appraiser to support an increase in the appraised value of property under the circumstances described by this subsection.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  The selection of comparable properties and the application of appropriate adjustments for the determination of an appraised value of property by any person under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=41.43">41.43</a>(b)(3) or <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=42.26">42.26</a>(a)(3) must be based on the application of generally accepted appraisal methods and techniques.  Adjustments must be based on recognized methods and techniques that are necessary to produce a credible opinion.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, property owners representing themselves are entitled to offer an opinion of and present argument and evidence related to the market and appraised value or the inequality of appraisal of the owner's property.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  Appraisal methods and techniques included in the most recent versions of the following are considered generally accepted appraisal methods and techniques for the purposes of this title:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the Appraisal of Real Estate published by the Appraisal Institute;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  the Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal published by the Appraisal Institute;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice published by The Appraisal Foundation; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  a publication that includes information related to mass appraisal.</p>

Notwithstanding the presumption created by this subsection, a chief appraiser may, at his or her sole discretion, designate as the date on which a dealer commenced business a date other than the date of issuance to the dealer of a dealer's general distinguishing number.  The declaration is sufficient to comply with this subsection if it sets forth the following information:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the name and business address of each location at which the dealer owner conducts business;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  each of the dealer's general distinguishing numbers issued by the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  a statement that the dealer owner is the owner of a dealer's motor vehicle inventory; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  the market value of the dealer's motor vehicle inventory for the current tax year as computed under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=23.121">23.121</a>(b).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  Under the terms provided by this subsection, the chief appraiser may examine the books and records of the holder of a general distinguishing number issued by the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles.  A request made under this subsection must be made in writing, delivered personally to the custodian of the records, at the location for which the general distinguishing number has been issued, must provide a period not less than 15 days for the person to respond to the request, and must state that the person to whom it is addressed has the right to seek judicial relief from compliance with the request.  In a request made under this section the chief appraiser may examine:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the document issued by the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles showing the person's general distinguishing number;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  documentation appropriate to allow the chief appraiser to ascertain the applicability of this section and Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=23.122">23.122</a> to the person;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  sales records to substantiate information set forth in the dealer's declaration filed by the person.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  If a dealer fails to file a declaration as required by this section, the chief appraiser may report the dealer to the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles to initiate cancellation of the dealer's general distinguishing number.

The chief appraiser shall include with the report a copy of a declaration indicating the sale by a dealer of fewer than five motor vehicles in the prior year. A report by a chief appraiser to the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles as provided by this subsection is prima facie grounds for the cancellation of the dealer's general distinguishing number under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&amp;Value=503.038">503.038</a>(a)(9), Transportation Code, or for refusal by the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles to renew the dealer's general distinguishing number.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  A dealer who fails to file a declaration required by this section commits an offense.  An offense under this subsection is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed $500.  Each day during which a dealer fails to comply with the terms of this subsection is a separate violation.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  A dealer who violates Subsection (g) of this section commits an offense.  An offense under this subsection is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed $500.  Each day during which a person fails to comply with the terms of Subsection (g) of this section is a separate violation.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  In addition to other penalties provided by law, a dealer who fails to file or fails to timely file a declaration required by this section shall forfeit a penalty.  A tax lien attaches to the dealer's business personal property to secure payment of the penalty.  The appropriate district attorney, criminal district attorney, county attorney, chief appraiser, or person designated by the chief appraiser shall collect the penalty established by this section in the name of the chief appraiser.  Venue of an action brought under this subsection is in the county in which the violation occurred or in the county in which the owner maintains the owner's principal place of business or residence.  A penalty forfeited under this subsection is $1,000 for each month or part of a month in which a declaration is not filed or timely filed after it is due.</p>

A dealer who owes no vehicle inventory tax for the current year because he was not in business on January 1 may neither assign a unit property tax to a motor vehicle sold by the dealer nor remit money with the statement unless pursuant to the terms of a contract as provided by Subsection (l) of this section.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  A collector may establish a procedure, voluntary or mandatory, by which the unit property tax of a vehicle is paid and deposited into an owner's escrow account at the time of processing the transfer of title to the motor vehicle.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  A relevant taxing unit shall, on its tax bill prepared for the owner of a dealer's motor vehicle inventory, separately itemize the taxes levied against the dealer's motor vehicle inventory.  When the tax bill is prepared by a relevant taxing unit for a dealer's motor vehicle inventory, the assessor for the relevant taxing unit, or an entity, if any, other than the collector, that collects taxes on behalf of the taxing unit, shall provide the collector a true and correct copy of the tax bill sent to the owner, including taxes levied against the dealer's motor vehicle inventory.  The collector shall apply the money in the owner's escrow account to the taxes imposed and deliver a tax receipt to the owner.  The collector shall apply the amount to each relevant taxing unit in proportion to the amount of taxes levied, and the assessor of each relevant taxing unit shall apply the funds received from the collector to the taxes owed by the owner.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  If the amount in the escrow account is not sufficient to pay the taxes in full, the collector shall apply the money to the taxes and deliver to the owner a tax receipt for the partial payment and a tax bill for the amount of the deficiency together with a statement that the owner must remit to the collector the balance of the total tax due.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  The collector shall remit to each relevant taxing unit the total amount collected by the collector in deficiency payments.  The assessor of each relevant taxing unit shall apply those funds to the taxes owed by the owner.  Taxes that are due but not received by the collector on or before January 31 are delinquent.  Not later than February 15 the collector shall distribute to relevant taxing units in the manner set forth in this section all funds collected pursuant to the authority of this section and held in escrow by the collector as provided by this section.  This section does not impose a duty on a collector to collect delinquent taxes that the collector is not otherwise obligated by law or contract to collect.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(l)  A person who acquires the business or assets of an owner may, by contract, agree to pay the current year vehicle inventory taxes owed by the owner.  The owner who owes the current year tax and the person who acquires the business or assets of the owner shall jointly notify the chief appraiser and the collector of the terms of the agreement and of the fact that the purchaser has agreed to pay the current year vehicle inventory taxes owed by the selling dealer.  The chief appraiser and the collector shall adjust their records accordingly.  Notwithstanding the terms of Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=23.121">23.121</a> of this code, a person who agrees to pay current year vehicle inventory taxes as provided by this subsection is not required to file a declaration until the year following the acquisition.  This subsection does not relieve the selling owner of tax liability.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(m)  A dealer who fails to file a statement as required by this section commits an offense.  An offense under this subsection is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed $100.  Each day during which a dealer fails to comply with the terms of this subsection is a separate violation.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(n)  In addition to other penalties provided by law, a dealer who fails to file or fails to timely file a statement as required by this section shall forfeit a penalty.  A tax lien attaches to the dealer's business personal property to secure payment of the penalty.  The appropriate district attorney, criminal district attorney, county attorney, collector, or person designated by the collector shall collect the penalty established by this section in the name of the collector.  Venue of an action brought under this subsection is in the county in which the violation occurred or in the county in which the owner maintains the owner's principal place of business or residence.  A penalty forfeited under this subsection is $500 for each month or part of a month in which a statement is not filed or timely filed after it is due.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(o)  An owner who fails to remit unit property taxes due as required by this section shall pay a penalty of five percent of the amount due.  If the amount is not paid within 10 days after the due date, the owner shall pay an additional penalty of five percent of the amount due.  Notwithstanding the terms of this section, unit property taxes paid on or before January 31 of the year following the date on which they are due are not delinquent.  The collector, the collector's designated agent, or the county or district attorney shall enforce the terms of this subsection.  A penalty under this subsection is in addition to any other penalty provided by law if the owner's taxes are delinquent.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(p)  Fines collected pursuant to the authority of this section shall be deposited in the county depository to the credit of the general fund.  Penalties collected pursuant to the authority of this section are the sole property of the collector, may be used by no entity other than the collector, and may not be used to reduce or otherwise affect the annual appropriation to the collector that would otherwise be made.</p>

(a)  In this section:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  "Aggregate tax rate" means the combined tax rates of all appropriate taxing units authorized by law to levy property taxes against a dealer's heavy equipment inventory.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  "Dealer's heavy equipment inventory," "declaration," "dealer," "sales price," "subsequent sale," and "total annual sales" have the meanings assigned those terms by Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=23.1241">23.1241</a>.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  "Statement" means the dealer's heavy equipment inventory tax statement filed on a form adopted by the comptroller under this section.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  "Unit property tax factor" means a number equal to one-twelfth of the preceding year's aggregate ad valorem tax rate at the location where a dealer's heavy equipment inventory is located on January 1 of the current year.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  Except for an item of heavy equipment sold to a dealer, an item of heavy equipment included in a fleet transaction, an item of heavy equipment that is the subject of a subsequent sale, or an item of heavy equipment that is subject to a lease or rental, an owner or a person who has agreed by contract to pay the owner's current year property taxes levied against the owner's heavy equipment inventory shall assign a unit property tax to each item of heavy equipment sold from a dealer's heavy equipment inventory.  In the case of a lease or rental, the owner shall assign a unit property tax to each item of heavy equipment leased or rented.  The unit property tax of each item of heavy equipment is determined by multiplying the sales price of the item or the monthly lease or rental payment received for the item, as applicable, by the unit property tax factor.  If the transaction is a lease or rental, the owner shall collect the unit property tax from the lessee or renter at the time the lessee or renter submits payment for the lease or rental.  The owner of the equipment shall state the amount of the unit property tax assigned as a separate line item on an invoice.  On or before the 20th day of each month the owner shall, together with the statement filed by the owner as required by this section, deposit with the collector an amount equal to the total of unit property tax assigned to all items of heavy equipment sold, leased, or rented from the dealer's heavy equipment inventory in the preceding month to which a unit property tax was assigned.  The money shall be deposited by the collector to the credit of the owner's escrow account for prepayment of property taxes as provided by this section.  An escrow account required by this section is used to pay property taxes levied against the dealer's heavy equipment inventory, and the owner shall fund the escrow account as provided by this subsection.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  The collector shall maintain the escrow account for each owner in the county depository.  The collector is not required to maintain a separate account in the depository for each escrow account created as provided by this section but shall maintain separate records for each owner.  The collector shall retain any interest generated by the escrow account to defray the cost of administration of the prepayment procedure established by this section.  Interest generated by an escrow account created as provided by this section is the sole property of the collector and that interest may not be used by an entity other than the collector.  Interest generated by an escrow account may not be used to reduce or otherwise affect the annual appropriation to the collector that would otherwise be made.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  Except as provided by Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=23.1243">23.1243</a>, the owner may not withdraw funds in an escrow account created under this section.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  The comptroller by rule shall adopt a dealer's heavy equipment inventory tax statement form.  Each month, a dealer shall complete the form regardless of whether an item of heavy equipment is sold, leased, or rented.  A dealer may use no other form for that purpose.  The statement may include the information the comptroller considers appropriate but shall include at least the following:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  a description of each item of heavy equipment sold, leased, or rented including any unique identification or serial number affixed to the item by the manufacturer;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  the sales price of or lease or rental payment received for the item of heavy equipment, as applicable;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  the unit property tax of the item of heavy equipment, if any; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  the reason no unit property tax is assigned if no unit property tax is assigned.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  On or before the 20th day of each month, a dealer shall file with the collector the statement covering the sale, lease, or rental of each item of heavy equipment sold, leased, or rented by the dealer in the preceding month.  On or before the 20th day of a month following a month in which a dealer does not sell, lease, or rent an item of heavy equipment, the dealer must file the statement with the collector and indicate that no sales, leases, or rentals were made in the prior month.  A dealer shall file a copy of the statement with the chief appraiser and retain documentation relating to the disposition of each item of heavy equipment sold and the lease or rental of each item of heavy equipment.  A chief appraiser or collector may examine documents held by a dealer as provided by this subsection in the same manner, and subject to the same conditions, as provided by Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=23.1241">23.1241</a>(g).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  Except as provided by this subsection, Subsection (f) applies to any dealer, regardless of whether a dealer owes heavy equipment inventory tax for the current year.  A dealer who owes no heavy equipment inventory tax for the current year because the dealer was not in business on January 1:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  shall file the statement required by this section showing the information required by this section for each month that the dealer is in business;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  may not assign a unit property tax to an item of heavy equipment sold by the dealer or remit money with the statement except in compliance with the terms of a contract as provided by Subsection (k).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  A taxing unit shall, on its tax bill prepared for the owner of a dealer's heavy equipment inventory, separately itemize the taxes levied against the dealer's heavy equipment inventory.  When the tax bill is prepared for a dealer's heavy equipment inventory, the assessor for the taxing unit, or an entity, if any, other than the collector, that collects taxes on behalf of the taxing unit, shall provide the collector a true and correct copy of the tax bill sent to the owner, including taxes levied against the dealer's heavy equipment inventory.  The collector shall apply the money in the owner's escrow account to the taxes imposed and deliver a tax receipt to the owner.  The collector shall apply the amount to each appropriate taxing unit in proportion to the amount of taxes levied, and the assessor of each taxing unit shall apply the funds received from the collector to the taxes owed by the owner.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  If the amount in the escrow account is not sufficient to pay the taxes in full, the collector shall apply the money to the taxes and deliver to the owner a tax receipt for the partial payment and a tax bill for the amount of the deficiency together with a statement that the owner must remit to the collector the balance of the total tax due.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  The collector shall remit to each appropriate taxing unit the total amount collected by the collector in deficiency payments.  The assessor of each taxing unit shall apply those funds to the taxes owed by the owner.  Taxes that are due but not received by the collector on or before January 31 are delinquent.  Not later than February 15, the collector shall distribute to each appropriate taxing unit in the manner provided by this section all funds collected under authority of this section and held in escrow by the collector under this section.  This section does not impose a duty on a collector to collect delinquent taxes that the collector is not otherwise obligated by law or contract to collect.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  A person who acquires the business or assets of an owner may, by contract, agree to pay the current year heavy equipment inventory taxes owed by the owner.  The owner who owes the current year tax and the person who acquires the business or assets of the owner shall jointly notify the chief appraiser and the collector of the terms of the agreement and of the fact that the other person has agreed to pay the current year heavy equipment inventory taxes owed by the dealer.  The chief appraiser and the collector shall adjust their records accordingly.  Notwithstanding Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=23.1241">23.1241</a>, a person who agrees to pay current year heavy equipment inventory taxes as provided by this subsection is not required to file a declaration until the year following the acquisition.  This subsection does not relieve the selling owner of the tax liability.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(l)  Repealed by Acts 2011, 82nd Leg., R.S., Ch. 322, Sec. 8, eff. January 1, 2012.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(m)  In addition to other penalties provided by law, a dealer who fails to file or fails to timely file a statement as required by this section shall forfeit a penalty.  A tax lien attaches to the dealer's business personal property to secure payment of the penalty.  The appropriate district attorney, criminal district attorney, or county attorney may collect the penalty established by this section in the name of the collector.  The chief appraiser may collect the penalty in the name of the chief appraiser.  The chief appraiser or the appropriate district attorney, criminal district attorney, or county attorney may sue to enforce compliance with this section.  Venue of an action brought under this subsection, including an action for injunctive relief, is in the county in which the violation occurred or in the county in which the owner maintains the owner's principal place of business or residence.  The court may award attorney's fees to a chief appraiser, district attorney, criminal district attorney, or county attorney who prevails in a suit to collect a penalty or enforce compliance with this section.  A penalty forfeited under this subsection is $500 for each month or part of a month in which a statement is not filed or timely filed after it is due.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(n)  An owner who fails to remit unit property taxes due as required by this section shall pay a penalty of five percent of the amount due.  If the amount is not paid within 10 days after the due date, the owner shall pay an additional penalty of five percent of the amount due.  Notwithstanding this section, unit property taxes paid on or before January 31 of the year following the date on which they are due are not delinquent.  The collector, the collector's designated agent, or the county or district attorney shall enforce this subsection.  A penalty under this subsection is in addition to any other penalty provided by law if the owner's taxes are delinquent.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(o)  A fine collected under this section shall be deposited in the county depository to the credit of the general fund.  A penalty collected under this section is the sole property of the collector, may be used by no entity other than the collector, and may not be used to reduce or otherwise affect the annual appropriation to the collector that would otherwise be made.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(p)  Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=23.123">23.123</a> applies to a declaration or statement filed under this section in the same manner in which that section applies to a statement or declaration filed as required by Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=23.121">23.121</a> or <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=23.122">23.122</a>.</p>

The unit property tax of each vessel or outboard motor is determined by multiplying the sales price of the vessel or outboard motor by the unit property tax factor.

On or before the 10th day of a month following a month in which a dealer does not sell a vessel or outboard motor, the dealer must file the statement with the collector and indicate that no sales were made in the prior month.  A dealer shall file a copy of the statement with the chief appraiser and retain documentation relating to the disposition of each vessel and outboard motor sold.  A chief appraiser or collector may examine documents held by a dealer as provided by this subsection in the same manner, and subject to the same provisions, as are set forth in Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=23.124">23.124</a>(g).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  Except as provided by this subsection, the requirements of Subsection (f) of this section apply to all dealers, without regard to whether or not the dealer owes vessel and outboard motor inventory tax for the current year.  A dealer who owes no vessel and outboard motor inventory tax for the current year because he was not in business on January 1:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  shall file the statement required by this section showing the information required by this section for each month during which the dealer is in business;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  may neither assign a unit property tax to a vessel or outboard motor sold by the dealer nor remit money with the statement unless pursuant to the terms of a contract as provided by Subsection (l) of this section.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  A collector may establish a procedure, voluntary or mandatory, by which the unit property tax of a vessel or outboard motor is paid and deposited into an owner's escrow account at the time of processing the transfer of title to the vessel or outboard motor.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  A relevant taxing unit shall, on its tax bill prepared for the owner of a dealer's vessel and outboard motor inventory, separately itemize the taxes levied against the dealer's vessel and outboard motor inventory.  When the tax bill is prepared by a relevant taxing unit for a dealer's vessel and outboard motor inventory, the assessor for the relevant taxing unit, or an entity, if any, other than the collector, that collects taxes on behalf of the taxing unit, shall provide the collector a true and correct copy of the tax bill sent to the owner, including taxes levied against a dealer's vessel and outboard motor inventory.  The collector shall apply the money in the owner's escrow account to the taxes imposed and deliver a tax receipt to the owner.  The collector shall apply the amount to each relevant taxing unit in proportion to the amount of taxes levied, and the assessor of each relevant taxing unit shall apply the funds received from the collector to the taxes owed by the owner.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  If the amount in the escrow account is not sufficient to pay the taxes in full, the collector shall apply the money to the taxes and deliver to the owner a tax receipt for the partial payment and a tax bill for the amount of the deficiency together with a statement that the owner must remit to the collector the balance of the total tax due.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  The collector shall remit to each relevant taxing unit the total amount collected by the collector in deficiency payments.  The assessor of each relevant taxing unit shall apply those funds to the taxes owed by the owner.  Taxes that are due but not received by the collector on or before January 31 are delinquent.  Not later than February 15, the collector shall distribute to relevant taxing units in the manner set forth in this section all funds collected pursuant to the authority of this section and held in escrow by the collector as provided by this section.  This section does not impose a duty on a collector to collect delinquent taxes that the collector is not otherwise obligated by law or contract to collect.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(l)  A person who acquires the business or assets of an owner may, by contract, agree to pay the current year vessel and outboard motor inventory taxes owed by the owner.  The owner who owes the current year tax and the person who acquires the business or assets of the owner shall jointly notify the chief appraiser and the collector of the terms of the agreement and of the fact that the other person has agreed to pay the current year vessel and outboard motor inventory taxes owed by the dealer.  The chief appraiser and the collector shall adjust their records accordingly.  Notwithstanding the terms of Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=23.124">23.124</a> of this code, a person who agrees to pay current year vessel and outboard motor inventory taxes as provided by this subsection is not required to file a declaration until the year following the acquisition.  This subsection does not relieve the selling owner of the tax liability.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(m)  A dealer who fails to file a statement as required by this section commits an offense.  An offense under this subsection is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed $100.  Each day during which a dealer fails to comply with the terms of this subsection is a separate violation.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(n)  In addition to other penalties provided by law, a dealer who fails to file or fails to timely file a statement as required by this section shall forfeit a penalty.  A tax lien attaches to the owner's business personal property to secure payment of the penalty.  The appropriate district attorney, criminal district attorney, or county attorney shall collect the penalty established by this section in the name of the chief appraiser or collector.  Venue of an action brought under this subsection is in the county in which the violation occurred or in the county in which the owner maintains the owner's principal place of business or residence.  A penalty forfeited under this subsection is $500 for each month or part of a month in which a statement is not filed or timely filed after it is due.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(o)  An owner who fails to remit unit property taxes due as required by this section shall pay a penalty of five percent of the amount due.  If the amount is not paid within 10 days after the due date, the owner shall pay an additional penalty of five percent of the amount due.  Notwithstanding the terms of this section, unit property taxes paid on or before January 31 of the year following the date on which they are due are not delinquent.  The collector, the collector's designated agent, or the county or district attorney shall enforce the terms of this subsection.  A penalty under this subsection is in addition to any other penalty provided by law if the owner's taxes are delinquent.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(p)  Fines and penalties collected pursuant to the authority of this section shall be deposited in the county depository to the credit of the general fund.</p>

(a)  In this section:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  "Aggregate tax rate" means the combined tax rates of all appropriate taxing units authorized by law to impose property taxes on a retail manufactured housing inventory.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  "Appropriate taxing unit" means a taxing unit, including the county, authorized by law to impose property taxes on a retail manufactured housing inventory.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  "Chief appraiser," "collector," "declaration," "manufactured housing," "owner," "retail manufactured housing inventory," "retailer," "sales price," "subsequent sale," and "total annual sales" have the meanings assigned by Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=23.127">23.127</a>.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  "Statement" means the retail manufactured housing inventory tax statement filed on a form adopted by the comptroller under this section.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(5)  "Unit property tax factor" means a number equal to one-twelfth of the preceding year's aggregate ad valorem tax rate at the location at which a retail manufactured housing inventory is located on January 1 of the current year.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  Except for a unit of manufactured housing sold to a retailer or a unit of manufactured housing that is the subject of a subsequent sale, a retailer or a person who has agreed by contract to pay the retailer's current year property taxes imposed on the retailer's manufactured housing inventory shall assign a unit property tax to each unit of manufactured housing sold from a retail manufactured housing inventory.  The unit property tax of each unit of manufactured housing is determined by multiplying the sales price of the unit by the unit property tax factor.  On or before the 10th day of each month the retailer shall, together with the statement filed by the retailer as required by this section, deposit with the collector an amount equal to the total of the unit property tax assigned to all units of manufactured housing sold from the retail manufactured housing inventory in the preceding month to which a unit property tax was assigned.  The collector shall deposit the money to the credit of the retailer's escrow account for prepayment of property taxes as provided by this section.  An escrow account required by this section is used to pay property taxes imposed on the retail manufactured housing inventory, and the retailer shall fund the escrow account as provided by this subsection.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  The collector shall maintain the escrow account for each retailer in the county depository.  The collector is not required to maintain a separate account in the depository for each escrow account created as provided by this section but shall maintain separate records for each retailer.  The collector shall retain any interest generated by the escrow account to defray the cost of administration of the prepayment procedure established by this section.  Interest generated by an escrow account created as provided by this section is the sole property of the collector and may not be used by an entity other than the collector.  Interest generated by an escrow account may not be used to reduce or otherwise affect the annual appropriation to the collector that would otherwise be made.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  The retailer may not withdraw money in an escrow account created under this section.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  The comptroller by rule shall adopt a form entitled "Retail Manufactured Housing Inventory Tax Statement." Each month, a retailer shall complete the form regardless of whether a unit of manufactured housing is sold.  A retailer may not use another form for that purpose.  The statement shall include:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  a description of the unit of manufactured housing sold, including any unique identification or serial number affixed to each unit by the manufacturer;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  the sales price of the unit of manufactured housing;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  any unit property tax of the unit of manufactured housing;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  the reason a unit property tax is not assigned if that is the case; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(5)  any other information the comptroller considers appropriate.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  On or before the 10th day of each month, a retailer shall file with the collector the statement covering the sale of each unit of manufactured housing sold by the retailer in the preceding month.  On or before the 10th day of a month following a month in which a dealer does not sell a unit of manufactured housing, the dealer must file the statement with the collector and indicate that no sales were made in the prior month.  A retailer shall file a copy of the statement with the chief appraiser and retain documentation relating to the disposition of each unit of manufactured housing sold.  A chief appraiser or collector may examine documents held by a retailer as required by this subsection in the same manner, and subject to the same conditions, as in Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=23.127">23.127</a>(g).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  Subsection (f) applies to a retailer regardless of whether the retailer owes retail manufactured housing inventory tax for the current year.  A retailer who does not owe any retail manufactured housing inventory tax for the current year because the retailer was not in business on January 1 may not assign a unit property tax to a unit of manufactured housing sold by the retailer or remit money with the statement unless under the terms of a contract as provided by Subsection (k).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  An appropriate taxing unit shall, on its tax bill prepared for the owner of a retail manufactured housing inventory, separately itemize the taxes imposed on the retail manufactured housing inventory.  When the tax bill is prepared for a retail manufactured housing inventory, the assessor for the taxing unit, or an entity, if any, other than the collector, that collects taxes on behalf of the taxing unit, shall provide the collector a true and correct copy of the tax bill sent to the owner, including taxes imposed on the retail manufactured housing inventory.  The collector shall apply the money in the owner's escrow account to the taxes imposed and deliver a tax receipt to the owner.  The collector shall apply the amount to each appropriate taxing unit in proportion to the amount of taxes imposed, and the assessor of each taxing unit shall apply the money received from the collector to the taxes owed by the owner.  No penalties or interest shall be assessed against an owner for property taxes which the owner has previously paid but which are not delivered to the appropriate taxing unit before the date on which such taxes become delinquent.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  If the amount in the escrow account is not sufficient to pay the taxes in full, the collector shall apply the money to the taxes and deliver to the owner a tax receipt for the partial payment and a tax bill for the amount of the deficiency together with a statement that the owner must remit to the collector the balance of the total tax due;  however, no penalty or interest shall be assessed against an owner for that portion of the property taxes which represents the amount of the partial payment if the amount of the deficiency is not paid before the date the deficiency is delinquent.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  The collector shall remit to each appropriate taxing unit the total amount collected by the collector in deficiency payments.  The assessor of each taxing unit shall apply that amount to the taxes owed by the owner.  Taxes that are due but not received by the collector on or before January 31 are delinquent.  Not later than February 15, the collector shall distribute to each appropriate taxing unit in the manner provided by this section all money collected under this section and held in escrow by the collector under this section.  This section does not impose a duty on a collector to collect delinquent taxes that the collector is not otherwise obligated by law or contract to collect.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  A person who acquires the business or assets of a retailer may, by contract, agree to pay the current year retail manufactured housing inventory taxes owed by the retailer.  The retailer who owes the current year tax and the person who acquires the business or assets of the retailer shall jointly notify the chief appraiser and the collector of the terms of the agreement and of the fact that the purchaser has agreed to pay the current year retail manufactured housing inventory taxes owed by the selling retailer.  The chief appraiser and the collector shall adjust their records accordingly.  Notwithstanding Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=23.127">23.127</a>, a person who agrees to pay current year retail manufactured housing inventory taxes as provided by this subsection is not required to file a declaration until the year following the acquisition.  This subsection does not relieve the selling retailer of tax liability.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(l)  A retailer who fails to file a statement as required by this section commits an offense.  An offense under this subsection is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed $100. Each day that a retailer fails to comply with this subsection is a separate violation.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(m)  In addition to other penalties provided by law, a retailer who fails to file or fails to timely file a statement as required by this section is liable for a penalty in the amount of $500 for each month or part of a month in which a statement is not filed after it is due.  A tax lien attaches to the retailer's business personal property to secure payment of the penalty.  The appropriate district attorney, criminal district attorney, county attorney, collector, or person designated by the collector shall collect the penalty established by this section in the name of the collector.  Venue of an action brought under this subsection is in the county in which the violation occurred or in the county in which the retailer maintains the retailer's principal place of business or residence.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(n)  A retailer who fails to remit unit property taxes due as required by this section shall pay a penalty of five percent of the amount due.  If the amount is not paid within 10 days after the due date, the retailer shall pay an additional penalty of five percent of the amount due.  Notwithstanding this section, unit property taxes paid on or before January 31 of the year following the date on which they are due are not delinquent.  The collector, the collector's designated agent, or the county or district attorney shall enforce this subsection.  A penalty under this subsection is in addition to any other penalty provided by law if the owner's taxes are delinquent.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(o)  A fine collected under this section shall be deposited in the county depository to the credit of the general fund.  A penalty collected under this section is the sole property of the collector and may not be used by an entity other than the collector or used to reduce or otherwise affect the annual appropriation to the collector that would otherwise be made.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(p)  Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=23.123">23.123</a> applies to a statement filed under this section in the same manner in which that section applies to a statement filed as required by Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=23.122">23.122</a>.</p>

(a)  If a real property interest in oil or gas in place is appraised by a method that takes into account the future income from the sale of oil or gas to be produced from the interest, the method must use the average price of the oil or gas from the interest for the preceding calendar year multiplied by a price adjustment factor as the price at which the oil or gas produced from the interest is projected to be sold in the current year of the appraisal.  The average price for the preceding calendar year is calculated by dividing the sum of the monthly average prices for which oil and gas from the interest was selling during each month of the preceding calendar year by 12.  If there was no production of oil or gas from the interest during any month of the preceding calendar year, the average price for which similar oil and gas from comparable interests was selling during that month is to be used.

The price for the interest used in the second through the sixth calendar year of the appraisal may not reflect an annual escalation or de-escalation rate that exceeds the average annual percentage change from 1982 to the most recent year for which the information is available in the producer price index for domestically produced petroleum or for natural gas, as applicable, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor.

A waiver of the right to special appraisal provided by Subchapter C, D, E, F, or G may be submitted with an application for appraisal under that subchapter or at any other time.  A property owner who has waived special appraisal under this section as to one or more taxing units may make additional waivers under this section as to other taxing units in which the property is located.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  A waiver under this section is effective for 25 consecutive tax years beginning on the first tax year in which the waiver is effective without regard to whether the property is subject to appraisal under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=23.12">23.12</a> or Subchapter C, D, E, F, or G. To be effective in the year in which the waiver is executed, it must be filed before May 1 of that year with the chief appraiser of the appraisal district in which the property is located, unless for good cause shown the chief appraiser extends the filing deadline for not more than 60 days.

An application for revocation must be filed with the governing body of each taxing unit to which the revocation is to apply.  A waiver may not be revoked if revocation is prohibited under a rule adopted under Subsection (e). The revocation is effective in the year in which the governing body approves the revocation if the chief appraiser receives a written notice of the approval before the appraisal review board approves the appraisal records.  If the notice is not received before the deadline the revocation takes effect in the next tax year.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, a commissioners court, and the Texas Transportation Commission each, by rule, may ensure that a waiver under this section that applies to real property is properly and timely executed, and is irrevocable by the owner of the property to which the waiver applies or by any other related person receiving or proposing to receive, directly or indirectly, the proceeds of any bonds issued by or to be issued by the taxing unit.  The rules of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality apply to waivers applicable to taxing units that are conservation and reclamation districts subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.  The rules of the commissioners court apply to waivers applicable to taxing units that are road districts created by the commissioners court.  The rules of the Texas Transportation Commission apply to waivers applicable to taxing units that are road utility districts subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  For computations required to be made under this title, the appraised value of the property for taxation by a taxing unit to which a waiver applies is the value at which the property is taxed under this section.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  A waiver of a special appraisal of property under Subchapter C, D, E, F, or G of this chapter does not constitute a change of use of the property or diversion of the property to another use for purposes of the imposition of additional taxes under any of those subchapters.</p>

If the owner does not file a timely protest or if the final determination of the protest is that the additional taxes are due, the assessor for each taxing unit shall prepare and deliver a bill for the additional taxes plus interest as soon as practicable after the change of use occurs.  If the additional taxes are due because of a sale of the land, the assessor for each taxing unit shall prepare and deliver the bill as soon as practicable after the sale occurs.

The notice must include a form on which the owner may indicate that the owner remains entitled to have the land designated for agricultural use and a self-addressed postage prepaid envelope with instructions for returning the form to the chief appraiser.  The chief appraiser shall consider the owner's response on the form in determining whether the land has been diverted to a nonagricultural use.  If the chief appraiser does not receive a response on or before the 60th day after the date the notice is mailed, the chief appraiser must make a reasonable effort to locate the owner and determine whether the owner remains entitled to have the land designated for agricultural use before determining that the land has been diverted to a nonagricultural use.  For purposes of this subsection, sending an additional notice to the owner immediately after the expiration of the 60-day period by first class mail in an envelope on which is written, in all capital letters, "RETURN SERVICE REQUESTED," or another appropriate statement directing the United States Postal Service to return the notice if it is not deliverable as addressed, or providing the additional notice in another manner that the chief appraiser determines is appropriate, constitutes a reasonable effort on the part of the chief appraiser.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  If the additional taxes are due because the land has been diverted to a nonagricultural use as a result of a condemnation, the additional taxes and interest imposed by this section are the personal obligation of the condemning entity and not the property owner from whom the property was taken.</p>

In determining the appraised value of the land under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=23.41">23.41</a>, the effect on the value of the land caused by the infestation of ticks is an additional factor that must be taken into account.

Each taxing unit that participates in the appraisal district and imposes taxes on the land shall share the costs of the reappraisal in the proportion the total dollar amount of taxes imposed by that taxing unit on that land in the preceding year bears to the total dollar amount of taxes all taxing units participating in the appraisal district imposed on the land in the preceding year.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  If land is reappraised as provided by this section, the governing body of each taxing unit that participates in the appraisal district and imposes  taxes on the land shall provide for prorating the taxes on the land for the tax year in which the reappraisal is conducted.  If the taxes are prorated, taxes due on the land are determined as follows:  the taxes on the land based on its value on January 1 of that year are multiplied by a fraction, the denominator of which is 365 and the numerator of which is the number of days in that year before the date the reappraisal was conducted; the taxes on the land based on its reappraised value are multiplied by a fraction, the denominator of which is 365 and the numerator of which is the number of days, including the date the reappraisal was conducted, remaining in the year; and the total of the two amounts is the amount of taxes imposed on the land for that year.

The assessor for each taxing unit that imposed taxes on the property on the basis of appraisal under this section shall add the amount of the penalty to the unit's tax bill for taxes on the property against which the penalty is imposed.  The penalty shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as the taxes on the property against which the penalty is imposed.  The amount of the penalty constitutes a lien on the property against which the penalty is imposed and accrues penalty and interest in the same manner as a delinquent tax.</p>

APPRAISAL OF AGRICULTURAL LAND</p><br /><p class="left"><a name="23.51"></a><a name="65354.56158"></a></p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 23.51.  DEFINITIONS.  In this subchapter:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  "Qualified open-space land" means land that is currently devoted principally to agricultural use to the degree of intensity generally accepted in the area and that has been devoted principally to agricultural use or to production of timber or forest products for five of the preceding seven years or land that is used principally as an ecological laboratory by a public or private college or university and that has been used principally in that manner by a college or university for five of the preceding seven years.  Qualified open-space land includes all appurtenances to the land.  For the purposes of this subdivision, appurtenances to the land means private roads, dams, reservoirs, water wells, canals, ditches, terraces, and other reshapings of the soil, fences, and riparian water rights.  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subdivision, land that is currently devoted principally to wildlife management as defined by Subdivision (7)(B) or (C) to the degree of intensity generally accepted in the area qualifies for appraisal as qualified open-space land under this subchapter regardless of the manner in which the land was used in any preceding year.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  "Agricultural use" includes but is not limited to the following activities:  cultivating the soil, producing crops for human food, animal feed, or planting seed or for the production of fibers; floriculture, viticulture, and horticulture; raising or keeping livestock; raising or keeping exotic animals for the production of human food or of fiber, leather, pelts, or other tangible products having a commercial value; planting cover crops or leaving land idle for the purpose of participating in a governmental program, provided the land is not used for residential purposes or a purpose inconsistent with agricultural use; and planting cover crops or leaving land idle in conjunction with normal crop or livestock rotation procedure.  The term also includes the use of land to produce or harvest logs and posts for the use in constructing or repairing fences, pens, barns, or other agricultural improvements on adjacent qualified open-space land having the same owner and devoted to a different agricultural use.  The term also includes the use of land for wildlife management.  The term also includes the use of land to raise or keep bees for pollination or for the production of human food or other tangible products having a commercial value, provided that the land used is not less than 5 or more than 20 acres.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  "Category" means the value classification of land considering the agricultural use to which the land is principally devoted.  The chief appraiser shall determine the categories into which land in the appraisal district is classified.  In classifying land according to categories, the chief appraiser shall distinguish between irrigated cropland, dry cropland, improved pasture, native pasture, orchard, and waste.  The chief appraiser may establish additional categories.  The chief appraiser shall further divide each category according to soil type, soil capability, irrigation, general topography, geographical factors, and other factors that influence the productive capacity of the category.  The chief appraiser shall obtain information from the Texas Agricultural Extension Service, the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the United States Department of Agriculture, and other recognized agricultural sources for the purposes of determining the categories of land existing in the appraisal district.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  "Net to land" means the average annual net income derived from the use of open-space land that would have been earned from the land during the five-year period preceding the year before the appraisal by an owner using ordinary prudence in the management of the land and the farm crops or livestock produced or supported on the land and, in addition, any income received from hunting or recreational leases.  The chief appraiser shall calculate net to land by considering the income that would be due to the owner of the land under cash lease, share lease, or whatever lease arrangement is typical in that area for that category of land, and all expenses directly attributable to the agricultural use of the land by the owner shall be subtracted from this owner income and the results shall be used in income capitalization.  In calculating net to land, a reasonable deduction shall be made for any depletion that occurs of underground water used in the agricultural operation.  In this subdivision, "wildlife or livestock disease or pest area" means an area designated by a state agency as an area in which a disease or pest that affects wildlife or livestock exists or may exist, including a chronic wasting disease containment or surveillance zone and an area subject to a quarantine authorized by Subtitle C, Title 6, Agriculture Code. In calculating net to land of open-space land located in or adjacent to a wildlife or livestock disease or pest area, the chief appraiser shall take into consideration the effect that the presence of the applicable disease or pest or the designation of the area has on the net income from the land.  For land that qualifies under Subdivision (7) for appraisal under this subchapter, the chief appraiser may not consider in the calculation of net to land the income that would be due to the owner under a hunting or recreational lease of the land.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(5)  "Income capitalization" means the process of dividing net to land by the capitalization rate to determine the appraised value.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(6)  "Exotic animal" means a species of game not indigenous to this state, including axis deer, nilga antelope, red sheep, other cloven-hoofed ruminant mammals, or exotic fowl as defined by Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=AG&amp;Value=142.001">142.001</a>, Agriculture Code.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(7)  "Wildlife management" means:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  actively using land that at the time the wildlife-management use began was appraised as qualified open-space land under this subchapter or as qualified timber land under Subchapter E in at least three of the following ways to propagate a sustaining breeding, migrating, or wintering population of indigenous wild animals for human use, including food, medicine, or recreation:</p><p style="text-indent:25ex;" class="left">(i)  habitat control;</p><p style="text-indent:25ex;" class="left">(ii)  erosion control;</p><p style="text-indent:25ex;" class="left">(iii)  predator control;</p><p style="text-indent:25ex;" class="left">(iv)  providing supplemental supplies of water;</p><p style="text-indent:25ex;" class="left">(v)  providing supplemental supplies of food;</p><p style="text-indent:25ex;" class="left">(vi)  providing shelters; and</p><p style="text-indent:25ex;" class="left">(vii)  making of census counts to determine population;</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  actively using land to protect federally listed endangered species under a federal permit if the land is:</p><p style="text-indent:25ex;" class="left">(i)  included in a habitat preserve and is subject to a conservation easement created under Chapter <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&amp;Value=183">183</a>, Natural Resources Code; or</p><p style="text-indent:25ex;" class="left">(ii)  part of a conservation development under a federally approved habitat conservation plan that restricts the use of the land to protect federally listed endangered species; or</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(C)  actively using land for a conservation or restoration project to provide compensation for natural resource damages pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C.

If the taxes are prorated, taxes due on the land are determined as follows:  the taxes on the land based on its value on January 1 of that year are multiplied by a fraction, the denominator of which is 365 and the numerator of which is the number of days in that year before the date the reappraisal was conducted; the taxes on the land based on its reappraised value are multiplied by a fraction, the denominator of which is 365 and the numerator of which is the number of days, including the date the reappraisal was conducted, remaining in the year; and the total of the two amounts is the amount of taxes imposed on the land for that year.

The assessor for each taxing unit that imposed taxes on the property on the basis of appraisal under this section shall add the amount of the penalty to the unit's tax bill for taxes on the property against which the penalty is imposed.  The penalty shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as the taxes on the property against which the penalty is imposed.

Once an application is filed and appraisal under this subchapter is allowed, the land is eligible for appraisal under this subchapter in subsequent years without a new application unless the ownership of the land changes or its eligibility under this subchapter ends.  However, the chief appraiser if he has good cause to believe the land's eligibility under this subchapter has ended, may require a person allowed appraisal under this subchapter in a prior year to file a new application to confirm that the land is currently eligible under this subchapter by delivering a written notice that a new application is required, accompanied by the application form, to the person who filed the application that was previously allowed.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  The appraisal office shall make a sufficient number of printed application forms readily available at no charge.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  Each year the chief appraiser for each appraisal district shall publicize, in a manner reasonably designed to notify all residents of the district, the requirements of this section and the availability of application forms.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  A person whose land is allowed appraisal under this subchapter shall notify the appraisal office in writing before May 1 after eligibility of the land under this subchapter ends.

The notice shall include a brief explanation of the procedures for protesting the imposition of the penalty.  The assessor for each taxing unit that imposed taxes on the property on the basis of appraisal under this subchapter shall add the amount of the penalty to the unit's tax bill for taxes on the property against which the penalty is imposed.  The penalty shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as the taxes on the property against which the penalty is imposed.

The assessor for each taxing unit that imposed taxes on the property on the basis of appraisal under this subchapter shall add the amount of the penalty to the unit's tax bill for taxes on the property against which the penalty is imposed.  The penalty shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as the taxes on the property against which the penalty is imposed.
