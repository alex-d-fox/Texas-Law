If the boundaries of a zone are reduced, the tax increment base is reduced by the taxable value of the real property removed from the zone for the year in which the property was originally included in the zone's boundaries. If the municipality that designates a zone does not levy an ad valorem tax in the year in which the zone is designated, the tax increment base is determined by the appraisal district in which the zone is located using assumptions regarding exemptions and other relevant information provided to the appraisal district by the municipality.</p>

The governing body of the municipality may pledge irrevocably all or part of the fund for payment of tax increment bonds or notes.  The part of the fund pledged in payment may be used only for the payment of the bonds or notes or interest on the bonds or notes until the bonds or notes have been fully paid.  A holder of the bonds or notes or of coupons issued on the bonds has a lien against the fund for payment of the bonds or notes and interest on the bonds or notes and may protect or enforce the lien at law or in equity.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  Tax increment bonds are issued by ordinance of the municipality without any additional approval other than that of the attorney general.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  Tax increment bonds or notes, together with the interest on and income from those bonds or notes, are exempt from all taxes.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  The issuing municipality may provide in the contract with the owners or holders of tax increment bonds that it will pay into the tax increment fund all or any part of the revenue produced or received from the operation or sale of a facility acquired, improved, or constructed pursuant to a project plan, to be used to pay principal and interest on the bonds.  If the municipality agrees, the owners or holders of tax increment bonds may have a lien or mortgage on a facility acquired, improved, or constructed with the proceeds of the bonds.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  Tax increment bonds may be issued in one or more series.
