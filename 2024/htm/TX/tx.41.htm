The board of directors may refer the matter to the local administrative district judge with a recommendation that the judge remove the member of the appraisal review board serving as chairman of the appraisal review board from that member's position as chairman if the board determines that the chairman has failed to take the actions necessary to bring the appraisal review board into compliance with Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=5.103">5.103</a>(d) or this chapter, as applicable.
