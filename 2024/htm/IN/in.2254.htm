The period for the refund and interest begins on the date the department first provides the insurer with formal written notice that the insurer's filed rate is excessive or unfairly discriminatory, and interest continues to accrue until the refund is paid.  An insurer may not be required to pay any interest penalty if the insurer prevails in an appeal of the commissioner's order under Subchapter D, Chapter <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&amp;Value=36">36</a>.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  An insurer may not claim a premium tax credit to which the insurer is otherwise entitled unless the insurer complies with Subsection (b).</p>
