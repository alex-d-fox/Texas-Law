A withdrawal of consent is effective within a reasonable period of time after the date of the receipt by the regulated entity of the withdrawal.  Failure by a regulated entity to comply with Subsection (d) may be treated by the party as a withdrawal of consent.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  If the consent of a party to receive a written communication by electronic means is on file with a regulated entity before September 1, 2013, and if the entity intends to deliver to the party written communications under this section, then before the entity may deliver by electronic means additional written communications, the entity must notify the party of:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the written communications that may be delivered by electronic means that were not previously delivered by electronic means; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  the party's right to withdraw consent to have written communications delivered by electronic means.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  Except as otherwise provided by law, an oral communication or a recording of an oral communication may not qualify as a written communication delivered by electronic means for purposes of this chapter.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  If a signature on a written communication is required by law to be notarized, acknowledged, verified, or made under oath, the requirement is satisfied if the electronic signature of the notary public or other authorized person and the other required information are attached to or logically associated with the signature or written communication.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(l)  A notice of the cancellation or termination of a policy to which this section applies must be:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  a written communication; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  delivered to a party:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  by electronic means; and</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  in paper or another nonelectronic form.</p>
