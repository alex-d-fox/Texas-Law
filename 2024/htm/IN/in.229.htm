An agreement or amendment of an agreement takes effect according to its terms, except that an agreement or amendment may not take effect until the proposed agreement or amendment is published in the Texas Register.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  An agreement may provide for:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  determining a base state and multistate allocation of insurance premiums;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  tax reporting requirements;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  audit and refund claim procedures;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  exchange of information;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(5)  requirements for reporting on a multistate basis;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(6)  insurance and tax related terms and definitions;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(7)  penalties, fees, administrative costs, and interest rates;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(8)  audit assessment and refund claim limitation periods;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(9)  procedures for  collecting amounts due from agents, insurers, or other persons and for collecting and forwarding the  amounts due to the jurisdiction to which the amount is owed;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(10)  procedures for verifying refund claims by agents, insurers, or other persons and for collecting those amounts from the jurisdiction owing the refund amount;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(11)  the temporary remittal of funds equal to the amounts due to another jurisdiction, subject to appropriation of funds for that purpose; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(12)  other provisions to facilitate the administration of the agreement.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  The comptroller may, as required by the terms of an agreement, provide to an officer of another state any information that relates to the solicitation, negotiation, procurement, placement, issuance, receipt, or collection of premiums by an agent, insurer, or other person for an insurance contract or policy that may be subject to the premium taxes imposed by Chapter <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&amp;Value=225">225</a> or <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&amp;Value=226">226</a>.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  An agreement may provide for each state to audit the records of an agent, insurer, or other person based in this state to determine if insurance premium taxes due each state that is a party to the agreement are properly reported and paid.  An agreement may provide for each state to forward the findings of an audit performed on an agent, insurer, or other person based in this state to each other state in which the person has an allocation of taxable premiums.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  For an agent, insurer, or other person who has an allocation of taxable premiums in this state, the comptroller may use an audit performed by another state that is a party to an agreement with this state to make an assessment of insurance premium taxes against the agent, insurer, or other person.
