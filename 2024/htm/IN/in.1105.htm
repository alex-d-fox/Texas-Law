(a)  This section applies only to a policy issued before January 1, 1989, to which Subchapter B does not apply.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  The adjusted premiums for a policy to which this section applies must be computed on an annual basis or, at the option of the company, on a fully continuous basis if that basis is consistent with actual policy provisions and the use of that basis is specified by the policy.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  Except as provided by Subsection (f), the adjusted premiums must be a uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified by the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts stated in the policy as extra premiums to cover impairments or special hazards, so that the present value, as of the date the policy is issued, of all the adjusted premiums is equal to the sum of:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the then present value of the future guaranteed benefits available under the policy;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  two percent of:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount;  or</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  the equivalent uniform amount of insurance, as determined under this section, if the amount of insurance varies with the duration of the policy;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  40 percent of the adjusted premium for the first policy year;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  25 percent of the lesser of:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  the adjusted premium for the first policy year;  or</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  the adjusted premium for a whole life policy of the same or an equivalent uniform amount with uniform premiums for the whole of life issued at the same age for the same amount of insurance.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  In applying the percentages specified by Subsections (c)(3) and (4), an adjusted premium may not be considered to exceed four percent of the amount of insurance or equivalent uniform amount.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  For purposes of this section, for a policy that provides an amount of insurance that varies with the duration of the policy:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  except as provided by Subdivision (2), the equivalent uniform amount of insurance is considered to be the uniform amount of insurance provided by an otherwise similar policy, containing the same endowment benefit, if any, issued at the same age and for the same term, the amount of which does not vary with duration and the benefits under which have the same present value at the date of issue as the benefits under the policy;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  if the policy is issued on the life of a child younger than 10 years of age, the equivalent uniform amount of insurance may be computed as though the amount of insurance provided by the policy before the insured reaches 10 years of age were the amount provided by the policy at age 10.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  The adjusted premiums for a policy that provides term insurance benefits by rider or a supplemental policy provision must be equal to the adjusted premiums for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without the term insurance benefits, increased, during the period for which premiums for the term insurance benefits are payable, by the adjusted premiums for the term insurance.  The adjusted premiums specified by this subsection must be computed separately in the manner specified by Subsections (b)-(e).</p>
