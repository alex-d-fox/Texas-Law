The right provided by this subsection expires on the 90th day after the date the society's supreme governing body authorizes the conversion.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  Before an incorporated stock company that is converted from a fraternal benefit society may offer any stock for public sale, the society's membership has a preference right to purchase the stock.  A member may not subscribe for or purchase more than:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  25 percent of the capital stock of the new company;  or</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  10 percent of the capital stock of the new company, if there are other members applying in writing to purchase stock whose subscriptions are not filled.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  If the membership of a converted fraternal benefit society has not subscribed for the total capital stock authorized, the new company may permit others who were not society members at the time of the conversion to subscribe for stock and hold equal rights in the ownership of the stock.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  Not later than the 10th day after the date a fraternal benefit society approves a resolution authorizing the society to convert to an incorporated stock company, the society shall notify each holder of a benefit certificate or other member of:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the member's right to subscribe for and purchase the stock of the incorporated stock company;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  the amount of stock for which the member is entitled to subscribe;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  all other terms of the subscription and purchase.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  The notice required under Subsection (d) must be in a form approved by the department.
