or</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  knowingly failed to implement or comply with government-promulgated standards, guidance, or protocols intended to lower the likelihood of exposure to the disease that were applicable to the person or the person's business, provided that:</p><p style="text-indent:25ex;" class="left">(i)  the person had a reasonable opportunity and ability to implement or comply with the standards, guidance, or protocols;</p><p style="text-indent:25ex;" class="left">(ii)  the person refused to implement or comply with or acted with flagrant disregard of the standards, guidance, or protocols;

and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  reliable scientific evidence shows that the failure to warn the individual of the condition, remediate the condition, or implement or comply with the government-promulgated standards, guidance, or protocols was the cause in fact of the individual contracting the disease.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  Except as provided by Subsection (c), not later than the 120th day after the date a defendant files an answer to a claim to which Subsection (a) applies, the claimant shall serve on the defendant:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  a report authored by at least one qualified expert that provides a factual and scientific basis for the assertion that the defendant's failure to act caused the individual to contract a pandemic disease;
