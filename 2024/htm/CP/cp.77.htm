In this chapter, "human body part" means any tissue, organ, blood, or components thereof from a human.</p>
<p class="left">Acts 1985, 69th Leg., ch. 959, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1985.</p>

<p class="left"><a name="77.002"></a><a name="5474.4708"></a></p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 77.002.  POLICY.  It is important to the health and welfare of the people of this state that scientific knowledge, skills, and materials be available for the procedures of transplantation, injection, transfusion, or other transfer of human body parts.  The imposition of strict liability on persons and organizations engaged in these scientific procedures inhibits the exercise of sound medical judgment and restricts the availability of the knowledge, skills, and materials.  It is therefore the public policy of this state to promote the health and welfare of the people by limiting the legal liability arising from those scientific procedures to instances of negligence.</p>
