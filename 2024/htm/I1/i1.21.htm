DISSOLUTION OF THE ASSOCIATION.  Upon the effective date of this article, the board shall, after consultation with the joint underwriting association, representatives of the public, the Texas Medical Association, the Texas Podiatry Association, the Texas Hospital Association, and other affected individuals and organizations, promulgate a plan of suspension consistent with the provisions of this article, to become effective and operative on December 31, 1985, unless the board determines before that time that the association may be suspended or is no longer needed to accomplish the purposes for which it was created.  The plan of suspension shall contain provisions for maintaining reserves for losses which may be reported subsequent to the expiration of all policies in force at the time of such suspension.  If, after the date of suspension ordered by the board, the board finds, after notice and hearing, that all known claims have been paid, provided for, or otherwise disposed of by the association, relating to policies issued prior to such suspension, then the board may wind up the affairs of the association, relating to policies issued prior to such suspension, by paying all funds remaining in the association to a special fund created by the statutory liquidator of the board as a reasonable reserve to be administered by said liquidator for unknown claims and claims expenses and for reimbursing assessments and contributions in accordance with Section 4(b)(5) of this article.  The board shall, after consultation with the representatives of the public, the Texas Medical Association, the Texas Podiatry Association, the Texas Hospital Association, and other affected individuals and organizations, promulgate a plan for distribution of funds, if any, less reasonable and necessary expenses, to the policyholders ratably in proportion to premiums and assessments paid during the period of time prior to suspension in which the association issued policies.  When all claims have been paid and no further liability of this association exists, the statutory liquidator shall distribute all funds in its possession to the applicable policyholders in accordance with the plan promulgated by the board.  If such reserve fund administered by the statutory liquidator proves inadequate, the association shall be treated as an insolvent insurer in respect to the applicable provisions of Articles 21.28, 21.28A and 21.28-C, Insurance Code, not inconsistent with this article.  Notice of claim shall be made upon the board.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 12. AUTHORITY OF THE BOARD OVER DISSOLUTION.  At any time the board finds that the association is no longer needed to accomplish the purposes for which it was created, the board may issue an order suspending the association as of a certain date stated in the order.  As soon as may be reasonably practical after December 31, 1984, the board shall determine whether or not medical liability insurance is reasonably available to physicians, health care providers, or any category of physicians or health care providers in this state through facilities other than the association and the need for the continuation of the operation of the association as to physicians, health care providers, or any category of physicians or health care providers.  The board shall not make such determination until a public meeting has been held.  Prior notice of such meeting shall be given at least 10 days to the same persons or entities as are required for consultation in Section 11 of this article.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 13.
