In promulgating any such rating plans the Board shall give due consideration to the peculiar hazards and experience of individual risks, past and prospective, within and outside the State and to all other relevant factors, within and outside the State.  The Board shall have the authority also to alter or amend any and all of such rates of premiums so fixed and determined and adopted by it, and to raise or lower the same or any part thereof.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c) At least annually, the Board shall conduct a hearing to review the reports of premiums earned and losses incurred in the writing of motor vehicle insurance in this State and may fix, determine, and adopt new rates in whole or in part or may alter or amend rates previously fixed, determined, and adopted by the Board to assure that those rates comply with the requirements of this subchapter.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d) Said Board shall have authority to employ clerical help, inspectors, experts, and other assistants, and to incur such other expenses as may be necessary in carrying out the provisions of this law;  provided, however, that the number of employees and salary of each shall be fixed in the General Appropriation Bill passed by the Legislature.  The Board shall ascertain as soon as practicable the annual insurance losses incurred under all policies on motor vehicles in this State, make and maintain a record thereof, and collect such data as will enable said Board to classify the various motor vehicles of the State according to the risk and usage made thereof, and to classify and assign the losses according to the various classes of risks to which they are applicable;  the Board shall also ascertain the amount of premiums on all such policies for each class of risks, and maintain a permanent record thereof in such manner as will aid in determining just, reasonable and adequate rates of premiums.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e) Motor vehicle or automobile insurance as referred to in this subchapter shall be taken and construed to mean every form of insurance on any automobile or other vehicle hereinafter enumerated and its operating equipment or necessitated by reason of the liability imposed by law for damages arising out of the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use in this State of any automobile, motorcycle, motorbicycle, truck, truck-tractor, tractor, traction engine, or any other self-propelled vehicle, and including also every vehicle, trailer or semi-trailer pulled or towed by a motor vehicle, but excluding every motor vehicle running only upon fixed rails or tracks.

(a)  On and after the filing and effective date of such classification of such risks and rates, no such insurer, except as otherwise provided herein, shall issue or renew any such insurance at premium rates which are greater or lesser than those promulgated by the Board as just, reasonable, adequate and not excessive for the risks to which they respectively apply, and not confiscatory as to any class of insurance carriers authorized by law to write such insurance after taking into consideration the deviation provisions of this Article.  Any insurer desiring to write insurance at rates different from those promulgated by the Board shall make a written application to the Board for permission to file a uniform percentage deviation for a lesser or greater rate, on a statewide basis unless otherwise ordered by the Board, from the class rates or classes of rates promulgated by the Board.  Any insurer desiring to write insurance under a classification plan different from that promulgated by the Board shall make written application to the Board for permission to do so;  provided, however, the Board shall approve the use of only such additions or refinements in its classification plan as will produce subclassifications which, when combined, will enable consideration of the insurer's experience under both the Board classification plan and its own classification plan.  Such application shall be approved in whole or in part by the Board, provided the Board finds that the resulting premiums will be just, adequate, reasonable, not excessive and not unfairly discriminatory, taking into consideration the following:</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(1) the financial condition of the insurer;</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(2) the method of operation and expenses of such insurer;</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(3) the actual paid and incurred loss experience of the insurer;</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(4) earnings of the insurer from investments together with a projection of prospective earnings from investments during the period for which the application is made;  and</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(5) such application meets the reasonable conditions, limitations, and restrictions deemed necessary by the Board.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">In considering all matters set forth in such application the Board shall give consideration to the composite effect of items (2), (3), and (4) above and the Board shall deny such application if it finds that the resulting premiums would be inadequate, excessive, or unfairly discriminatory.  Any original or renewal policy of insurance issued pursuant to an approved plan of deviation shall have attached to or imprinted on the face of such policy the following notice:  "The premium charged for this policy is greater than the premium rates promulgated by the State Board of Insurance."  The notice shall be in 10-point or larger prominent typesize.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Except as the Board may authorize, the deviation provisions in this Article shall not apply to insurance written pursuant to other provisions of this Chapter in which a deviation from standard rates is authorized, including, but not limited to, automobile liability experience rating and fleet rating plans.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b) The Board shall issue its order in writing setting forth the terms of approval or reasons for denial of each application filed for deviation.  On January 1, 1974 and thereafter if the Board has not issued its order within 30 days after the filing of an application, the application shall be "deemed approved" by the Board.  Provided, however, that the Board may thereafter require the applicant insurer to furnish proof to the Board that the matters set out in the application are true and correct and that such application meets the requirements of this Article.  If after notice and hearing the Board determines that any application "deemed to have been approved" by the Board contains false or erroneous information or the Board determines that the application does not meet the requirements of this Article the Board may suspend or revoke the approval "deemed to have been granted."</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">An insurer that has received approval, or is "deemed to have received approval" for the use of a deviation may apply for an amendment to such deviation or by notice to the Board withdraw the deviation.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c) From and after the effective date of an application approved by the Board, or "deemed to have been approved" by the Board, such insurer may write insurance in accordance with such approval.  Provided, however, that the right to write insurance at a lesser or greater rate as approved may be suspended or revoked by the Board, after notice and hearing, if upon examination or at any time it appears to or is the opinion of the Board that such insurer:</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(1) has had a change in its financial condition since the granting of the application;  or</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(2) the actual paid and incurred losses of the insurer have materially changed since the granting of the application;  or</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(3) there has been a material increase in expenses of such insurer since the granting of the application;  or</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(4) there has been a material reduction in earnings from investments by the insurer since the granting of the application;  or</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(5) the insurer has failed or refused to furnish information required by the Board;  or</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(6) the insurer has failed to abide by or follow its rate deviation previously approved by the Board.  The Board may suspend the right of an insurer to write insurance at the rates approved under such application, pending hearing, provided that the Board in or accompanying the order suspending such right, sets such hearing within not less than 10 nor more than 30 days following the issuance of its order.  The Board shall conduct the hearing within not less than 10 nor more than 30 days following the issuance of its order suspending such right, unless the insurer subject to the order requests the Board to delay the hearing beyond 30 days.  The right to write insurance at the lesser or greater rate previously approved by the Board shall automatically terminate, except as herein provided, upon the promulgation by the Board of new or different rates as provided for in the first sentence of "Section (a)" of this Article, and as further provided in paragraphs one and two of Article <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=I1&amp;Value=5.01">5.01</a>, Insurance Code, as amended.  After the effective date of the Board's promulgation or authorization of new or different rates, the insurer may not thereafter write insurance at a lesser or greater rate, except that an insurer may continue to write insurance at a deviated rate by applying the percentage of the previously approved deviation applicable to the prior rates as the percentage of deviation applicable to the new or different rates promulgated by the Board, limited, however, to a period of 60 days after the effective date of the new or different rates, and not thereafter, and only if such insurer within 30 days following promulgation by the Board of new or different rates, shall make a written application to the Board for permission to deviate from the new or different rates promulgated by the Board.  The Board by order may extend the use of prior approved deviations beyond the 60 day period hereinabove set out.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d) It is expressly provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, a rate or premium for such insurance greater than the standard rate or premium that has been promulgated by the Board may be used on any specific risk if:</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(1) a written application is made to the Board naming the insurer and stating the coverage and rate proposed;</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(2) the person to be insured or person authorized to act in relation to the risk to be insured consents to such rate;</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(3) the reasons for requiring such greater rate or premium are stated in or attached to the application;</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(4) the person to be insured or person authorized to act for such person signs the application;  and</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(5) the Board approves the application by order or by stamping.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e) In the administration of this Act the Board shall resolve by rules and regulations, to the extent permitted by law, any conflicts or ambiguities as may be necessary to accomplish the purposes of this Act.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f) This Article, as amended, is effective September 1, 1973.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g) Notwithstanding Sections (a) through (e) of this article, on and after the effective date of S.B.

(a)  Every insurer governed by Subchapter B of Chapter 5 of the Insurance Code, as amended, and every life, health, and accident insurer governed by Chapter 3 of the Insurance Code, as amended, is authorized to issue prepaid legal services contracts.  Every such insurer or rating organization authorized under Article 5.16 of the Insurance Code shall file with the State Board of Insurance all rules and forms applicable to prepaid legal service contracts in a manner to be established by the State Board of Insurance.  Certification, by a qualified actuary, to the appropriateness of the charges, rates, or rating plans, based upon reasonable assumptions, shall accompany the filing along with adequate supporting information.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b) The State Board of Insurance shall, within a reasonable period, approve any form if the requirements of this section are met.  It shall be unlawful to issue such forms until approved or to use such schedules of charges, rates, or rating plans until filed.  If the State Board of Insurance has good cause to believe such rates and rating plans do not comply with the standards of this article, it shall give notice in writing to every insurer or rating organization which filed such rates or rating plans, stating therein in what manner and to what extent such noncompliance is alleged to exist and specifying therein a reasonable time, not less than 30 days thereafter, in which such noncompliance may be corrected.  If the board has not acted on any form, rate, rating plan, or charges within 30 days after the filing of same, they shall be deemed approved.

Such description should include, but not be limited to, a description of coverage offered as either an indemnity coverage or a contract that provides only consultation and advice on simple legal matters, either alone or in combination with a referral service, and that provides fee discounts for other matters.  To provide for the actuarial soundness of a prepaid legal services contract issued under this article, the State Board of Insurance may require that prepaid legal services contracts have rates that are adequate to reasonably provide the benefits under the prepaid legal services contracts.  This subsection does not apply to a prepaid legal services contract that provides only consultation and advice on simple legal matters, either alone or in combination with a referral service, and that provides fee discounts for other matters.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g) The State Board of Insurance may not determine, fix, prescribe, set, or promulgate maximum rates or maximum amounts of premium to be charged for a prepaid legal services contract issued under this chapter.

For purposes of this subsection, "national insurer" means an insurer subject to this article that, either directly or together with its affiliates as part of an insurance holding company system as those terms are defined by Article 21.49-1 of this code, is licensed to do business and write the kinds of insurance that are subject to this subchapter in 26 or more states and maintains minimum annual direct written premiums for residential property insurance of $750 million in the aggregate for all states. </p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c) The commissioner may approve the use of policy forms and endorsements adopted by a national organization of insurance companies or a similar organization, if such forms or endorsements are filed with and are approved by the commissioner in accordance with this article. </p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d) An insurer may use an endorsement to the policy forms adopted or approved by the commissioner under this article if the endorsement is approved by the commissioner pursuant to this article. </p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e) Unless adopted or approved by the commissioner pursuant to Subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this article or, in the case of an endorsement, under Subsection (d) of this article, an insurance policy or endorsement for use in writing the types of insurance subject to this article may not be delivered or issued for delivery in this state. </p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f) Each filing pursuant to Subsection (c) or (d) of this article shall be made not later than the 60th day before the date of any use or delivery for use.  At the expiration of the 60-day period, a filed form or endorsement is approved unless before the expiration of the 60 days the commissioner either disapproves the form or endorsement by order or approves the form or endorsement.  Approval of a form or endorsement by the commissioner constitutes a waiver of any unexpired portion of the 60-day period.  The commissioner may extend, by not more than an additional 30 days, the period during which the commissioner may approve or disapprove a form or endorsement by giving notice to the filer of the extension before the expiration of the initial period.

For the purposes of this subsection, a policy or endorsement is written in plain language if it achieves the minimum score established by the commissioner on the Flesch reading ease test or an equivalent test selected by the commissioner or, at the option of the commissioner, if it conforms to the language requirements in a National Association of Insurance Commissioners model act relating to plain language.
