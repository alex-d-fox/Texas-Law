If the department and the affected utility enter into an agreement after negotiations under Subsection (e), the terms and conditions of the agreement govern the relocation of public utility facilities covered by the agreement.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  If the department and an affected utility do not enter into an agreement under Subsection (e), the department shall provide to the affected utility:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  written notice of the department's determination that the public utility facility must be removed;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  a final plan for relocation of the public utility facility;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  reasonable terms and conditions for an agreement with the utility for the relocation of the public utility facility.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  Not later than the 90th day after the date a utility receives the notice from the department, including the plan and agreement terms and conditions under Subsection (g), the utility shall enter into an agreement with the department that provides for the relocation.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  If the utility fails to enter into an agreement within the 90-day period under Subsection (h), the department may relocate the public utility facility at the sole cost and expense of the utility less any reimbursement of costs that would have been payable to the utility under applicable law.  A relocation by the department under this subsection shall be conducted in full compliance with applicable law, using standard equipment and construction practices compatible with the utility's existing facilities, and in a manner that minimizes disruption of utility service.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  The 90-day period under Subsection (h) may be extended:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  by mutual agreement between the department and the utility;  or</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  for any period during which the utility is negotiating in good faith with the department to relocate its facility.</p>
