LEGISLATIVE INTENT AND CONSTRUCTION.  (a)  Public transportation services are provided in this state by many different entities, both public and private.  The multiplicity of public transportation providers and services, coupled with a lack of coordination between state oversight agencies, has generated inefficiencies, overlaps in service, and confusion for consumers.  It is the intent of this chapter:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  to eliminate waste in the provision of public transportation services;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  to generate efficiencies that will permit increased levels of service;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  to further the state's efforts to reduce air pollution.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  This chapter shall be liberally construed to achieve its purposes.</p>
