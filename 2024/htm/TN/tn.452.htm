In this subsection, "collision" includes:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  a collision that involves an authority's revenue vehicle, other than a lawfully parked revenue vehicle, and results in property damage, injury, or death; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  an operating incident resulting in the injury or death of a person on board or boarding or alighting from an authority's revenue vehicle.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  The number of miles between mechanical service calls is computed by dividing the annual number of miles for all service, including charter service and nonrevenue service, by the number of mechanical service calls for the same period.  In this subsection, "mechanical service call" means an interruption in revenue service that is caused by revenue vehicle equipment failure that requires assistance from a person other than the vehicle operator before the vehicle can be operated normally.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  In this section:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  "Operating cost" means an authority's costs of providing public transit service, including purchased transit service not performed by the authority, but excluding the costs of:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  depreciation, amortization, and capitalized charges;</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  charter bus operations;  and</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(C)  coordination of carpool and vanpool activities.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  "Passenger" or "passenger trips" means the number of all passenger boardings, including transfers, but excluding charter passengers and carpool and vanpool passengers whose trips are only coordinated by the authority.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  "Revenue service" means the time an authority revenue vehicle is in service to carry passengers, other than charter passengers.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  "Revenue vehicle" means a vehicle, or a combination of rail vehicles comprising a train, that is:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  used to carry paying passengers; and</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  operated by an authority or as a purchased service.</p>
