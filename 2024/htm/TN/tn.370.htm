(a)  In this section, "unit of election" means a political subdivision that previously voted to join the service area of a transit provider.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  An authority may request in writing a transit provider to transfer the provider's transit system and taxing authority to the authority if the board determines that the traffic needs of the counties in which the authority operates could be most efficiently and economically met by the transfer.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  On receipt of a written request under Subsection (b), the governing body of the transit provider may authorize the authority to solicit public comment and conduct at least one public hearing on the proposed transfer in each unit of election in the transit provider's service area.  Notice of a hearing must be published in the Texas Register, one or more newspapers of general circulation in the transit provider's service area, and a newspaper, if any, published in the counties of the requesting authority.  The notice shall also solicit written comments on the proposed transfer.  The transit provider may participate fully with the authority in conducting a public hearing.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  A board may approve the acquisition of the transit provider if the governing body of the transit provider approves transfer of its operations to the authority and dissolution of the transit provider is approved in an election ordered under Subsection (e).

The governing body of the transit provider shall submit to the qualified voters in the units of election in the transit provider's service area a proposition that reads substantially as follows: "Shall (name of transit provider) be dissolved and its services, property, funds, assets, employees, debts, and obligations be transferred to (name of regional mobility authority)?"</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  An election under Subsection (e) shall be conducted so that votes are separately tabulated and canvassed in each participating unit of election in the transit provider's service area.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  The governing body of the transit provider shall canvass the returns and declare the results of the election separately with respect to each unit of election.  If a majority of the votes received in a unit of election are in favor of the proposition, the proposition is approved in that unit of election.  The transit provider is dissolved and its services, property, funds, assets, employees, debts, and obligations are transferred to the authority only if the proposition is approved in every unit of election.  If the proposition is not approved in every unit of election, the proposition does not pass and the transit provider is not dissolved.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  A certified copy of the order or resolution recording the results of the election shall be filed with the department, the comptroller, and the governing body of each unit of election in the transit provider's service area.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  The authority shall assume all debts or other obligations of the transferred transit provider in connection with the acquisition of property under Subsection (g).

After payment of the stipend, the authority may make use of any work product contained in the unsuccessful proposal, including the techniques, methods, processes, and information contained in the proposal.  The use by the authority of any design element contained in an unsuccessful proposal is at the sole risk and discretion of the authority and does not confer liability on the recipient of the stipend under this subsection.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  An authority may provide in a request for detailed proposals for the payment of a partial stipend in the event a procurement is terminated prior to securing project financing and execution of a design-build contract.</p>
