The activities prohibited by this section are unfair competition and unlawful trade practices.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  No person having an interest in a permit issued under Subtitle A, Title 3, of this code may secure or hold, directly or indirectly, an ownership interest in the business or corporate stocks, including a stock option, convertible debenture, or similar interest, in a permit or business of a permittee of a different level who maintains licensed premises in Texas.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  No person may act or serve as officer, director, or employee of the businesses of permittees at different levels.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  No permittee may own the premises, fixtures, or equipment of a permittee of a different level.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  No permittee may secure or in any manner obtain the use of any premises, fixtures, or equipment on the credit of a permittee of a different level.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  No permittee may loan to, or by means of his credit secure a loan for, a permittee of a different level.
