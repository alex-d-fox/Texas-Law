Any corporation (except carrier) holding a permit under this code which shall violate any provisions hereof, or any rule or regulation promulgated hereunder, shall be subject to forfeiture of its charter and it shall be the duty of the attorney general, when any such violation is called to the attorney general's attention, to file a suit for such cancellation in a district court of Travis County.

No minor, unless accompanied by his or her parent, guardian, adult husband or adult wife, or other adult person into whose custody he or she has been committed for the time by some court, shall knowingly be allowed on the premises of the holder of a package store permit.  The prohibition against the presence of a minor on the premises of the holder of a package store permit does not apply to the presence on the premises of the holder or a person lawfully employed by the holder.  Any package store permittee who shall be injured in the permittee's business or property by another package store permittee by reason of anything prohibited in this section may institute suit in any district court in the county wherein the violation is alleged to have occurred to require enforcement by injunctive procedures and/or to recover threefold the damages sustained by the permittee; plus costs of suit including a reasonable attorney's fee.
