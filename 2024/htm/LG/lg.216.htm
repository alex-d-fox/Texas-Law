(a)  For an off-premise sign that is required to be removed, the compensable cost is an amount computed by determining the average annual gross revenue received by the owner from the sign during the two years preceding September 1, 1985, or the two years preceding the month in which the removal date of the sign occurs, whichever is less, and by multiplying that amount by three.  If the sign has not been in existence for all of either two-year period, the average annual gross revenue for that period, for the purpose of this computation, is an amount computed by dividing 12 by the number of months that the sign has been in existence, and multiplying that result by the total amount of the gross revenue received for the period that the sign has been in existence.  However, if the sign did not generate revenue for at least one month preceding September 1, 1985, this computation of compensable costs is to be made using only the average annual gross revenue received during the two years preceding the month in which the removal date of the sign occurs, and by multiplying that amount by three.  In determining the amounts under this paragraph, a sign is treated as if it were in existence for the entire month if it was in existence for more than 15 days of the month and is treated as if it were not in existence for any part of the month if it was in existence for 15 or fewer days of the month.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  The owner of the real property on which the sign was located is entitled to be compensated for any decrease in the value of the real property.

The abated taxes may be on any real or personal property owned by the owner of the sign except residential property.  The right to the abatement of taxes is assignable by the holder, and the assignee may use the right to abatement with respect to taxes on any nonresidential property in the same taxing jurisdiction.  In a municipality where tax abatement is used to pay compensable costs, the costs include reasonable interest and the abatement period may not exceed five years.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  The municipality may allocate to a special fund in the municipal treasury, to be known as the sign abatement and community beautification fund, all or any part of the municipal property taxes paid on signs, on the real property on which the signs are located, or on other real or personal property owned by the owner of the sign.  The municipality may make payments from that fund to reimburse compensable costs to owners of signs required to be relocated, reconstructed, or removed.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  The municipality may provide for the issuance of sign abatement revenue bonds and use the proceeds to make payments to reimburse costs to the owners of signs within the corporate limits of such municipality that are required to be relocated, reconstructed, or removed.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  The municipality may pay compensable costs in cash.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  Except as prohibited by federal law, a municipality with a population of more than 1.9 million may pay the compensable costs to the owner of an on-premise sign by allowing the sign to remain in place for a period sufficient to recover the compensable cost of the sign as determined under Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&amp;Value=216.009">216.009</a>, based on a determination by the municipal board of the average annual gross revenue as determined under Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&amp;Value=216.008">216.008</a> that would be generated by the sign in its specific location if the sign were used as an off-premise sign rather than an on-premise sign.
