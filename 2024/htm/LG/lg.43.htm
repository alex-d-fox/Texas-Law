Any attempted annexation of the smaller municipality that does not include the adoption of that comprehensive zoning ordinance is void.  That comprehensive zoning ordinance may not be repealed or amended for a period of 10 years unless the written consent of the landowners who own at least two-thirds of the surface land of the annexed smaller municipality is obtained.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  If the annexed smaller municipality has on hand any bond funds for public improvements that are not appropriated or contracted for, the funds shall be kept in a separate special fund to be used only for public improvements in the area for which the bonds were voted.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  On the annexation, all claims, fines, debts, or taxes due and payable to the smaller municipality become due and payable to the larger municipality and shall be collected by it.

Upon placement of the funds in the escrow account, the annexation may become effective.  In the event a municipality timely escrows all estimated reimbursable amounts as required by this subsection and all such amounts, determined to be owed, including interest, are subsequently disbursed to the developer within five days of final determination in immediately available funds as required by this section, no penalties or interest shall accrue during the pendency of the escrow.  Either the municipality or developer may, by written notice to the other party, require disputes regarding the amount owed under this section to be subject to nonbinding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  A delinquent sum incurs a penalty of six percent of the amount of the sum for the first calendar month it is delinquent plus one percent for each additional month or portion of a month the sum remains unpaid.  For an annexation occurring prior to the effective date of the changes in law made by this Act in amending Subsection (b), a delinquent sum begins incurring a penalty on the first day of the eighth month following the month in which the municipality enacted its annexation ordinance.  For an annexation occurring after the effective date of this Act, a delinquent sum begins incurring a penalty on the first day after the date the municipality enacts its annexation ordinance.</p>
