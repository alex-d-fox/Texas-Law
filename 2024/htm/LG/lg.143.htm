(a)  In addition to the other notice requirements prescribed by this chapter, the letter of disciplinary action issued to a fire fighter or police officer must state that in an appeal of an indefinite suspension, a suspension, a promotional pass over, or a recommended demotion, the appealing fire fighter or police officer may elect to appeal to an independent third party hearing examiner instead of to the commission.  The letter must also state that if the fire fighter or police officer elects to appeal to a hearing examiner, the person waives all rights to appeal to a district court except as provided by Subsection (j).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  To exercise the choice of appealing to a hearing examiner, the appealing fire fighter or police officer must submit to the director a written request as part of the original notice of appeal required under this chapter stating the person's decision to appeal to an independent third party hearing examiner.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  The hearing examiner's decision is final and binding on all parties.  If the fire fighter or police officer decides to appeal to an independent third party hearing examiner, the person automatically waives all rights to appeal to a district court except as provided by Subsection (j).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  If the appealing fire fighter or police officer chooses to appeal to a hearing examiner, the fire fighter or police officer and the department head or their designees shall first attempt to agree on the selection of an impartial hearing examiner.  If the parties do not agree on the selection of a hearing examiner on or within 10 days after the date the appeal is filed and no motion to consolidate is filed under Subsection (k) of this section, the director shall on the next work day following notice that the parties have failed to agree on a selection of a hearing examiner request a list of seven qualified neutral arbitrators from the American Arbitration Association or the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service or their successors in function.  The fire fighter or police officer and the department head or their designees may agree on one of the seven neutral arbitrators on the list.  If they do not agree within 25 days after the date the appeal was filed, each party or the party's designee shall on the 25th day after the appeal was filed alternate striking a name from the list and the name remaining is the hearing examiner.  In the event that the 25th day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, then the parties shall strike the list the next work day.  The parties or their designees shall agree on a date for the hearing that is within the time period prescribed by Subsection (e).  In the event that the director does not request the list of seven qualified neutral arbitrators within the time prescribed by this subsection or the department head or his designee fails to strike the list within the time prescribed by this subsection, the fire fighter or police officer or his designee shall select the arbitrator from the list provided.  In the event that the fire fighter or police officer or his designee fails to strike the list within the time prescribed by this subsection, the department head or his designee shall select the arbitrator from the list provided.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  The appeal hearing must begin within 60 days after the date the appeal is filed and shall begin as soon as the hearing examiner can be scheduled.  If the hearing examiner cannot begin the hearing within 45 calendar days after the date of selection, the fire fighter or police officer may, within two days after learning of that fact, call for the selection of a new hearing examiner using the procedure prescribed by Subsection (d).  If the appeal hearing is not begun within 60 days after the date the appeal is filed, the indefinite suspension, suspension, promotional pass over, or recommended demotion is upheld and the appeal is withdrawn if the fire fighter or police officer is not ready to proceed, and the appeal is sustained if the department head is not ready to proceed.  In computing the 60-day period, a period of delay not to exceed 30 calendar days because of a continuance granted at the request of the department head or his representative or the fire fighter or police officer or his representative on good cause being shown, or because of the unavoidable unavailability of the hearing examiner on the date of the hearing, or because of the pendency of a motion to consolidate with another hearing as provided in Subsection (k) of this section is excluded.  In no event may a hearing examiner grant a continuance beyond 30 days in an indefinite suspension.  A hearing examiner may grant a continuance beyond the 30-day period upon good cause being shown in a disciplinary suspension unless the fire fighter or police officer has another disciplinary action pending.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  In each hearing conducted under this section, the hearing examiner has the same duties and powers as the commission, including the right to issue subpoenas.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  In a hearing conducted under this section, the parties may agree to an expedited hearing procedure.  Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, in an expedited procedure the hearing examiner shall render a decision on the appeal within 10 days after the date the hearing closed.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  In an appeal that does not involve an expedited hearing procedure, the hearing examiner shall make a reasonable effort to render a decision on the appeal within 30 days after the date the hearing ends or the briefs are filed.  The hearing examiner's inability to meet the time requirements imposed by this section does not affect the hearing examiner's jurisdiction, the validity of the disciplinary action, or the hearing examiner's final decision.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  The hearing examiner's fees and expenses are shared equally by the appealing fire fighter or police officer and by the department.  The costs of a witness are paid by the party who calls the witness.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  A district court may hear an appeal of a hearing examiner's award only on the grounds that the arbitration panel was without jurisdiction or exceeded its jurisdiction or that the order was procured by fraud, collusion, or other unlawful means.  If the basis for the appeal of the hearing examiner's award is based on the grounds that the arbitration panel was without jurisdiction or exceeded its jurisdiction, the petition must be filed in district court within 10 days of the hearing examiner's decision.  An appeal must be brought in the district court having jurisdiction in the municipality in which the fire or police department is located.  In the event the municipality is located in more than one county then the suit must be brought in the county having the majority of the population of the municipality.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  In an appeal of an indefinite suspension, a suspension, a promotional pass over, or a recommended demotion, each appealing fire fighter or police officer or the appealing fire fighter's or police officer's representative shall be entitled to the selection of a hearing examiner pursuant to Subsection (d) of this section to hear the case.  The fire fighter, police officer, department head, or a representative of any of those may, within 10 days of the date they received notice of the appeal, file a motion with a copy to the opposing side to consolidate the case with that of one or more other fire fighters or police officers where the charges arise out of the same incident.  The motion to consolidate may be agreed to in writing and filed with the director.  If a motion to consolidate the cases is filed and not agreed to, a hearing examiner shall be chosen pursuant to the provisions of Subsection (d) of this section to hear the motion.  The decision of the hearing examiner shall be final and binding as to the issue of consolidation.  The hearing examiner chosen to hear the motion to consolidate shall not hear the case, and the provisions of Subsection (d) of this section shall be used to choose the hearing examiner with the day the decision is rendered being the equivalent of the date the appeal was filed.</p>

If the department head intends to order an indefinite suspension after the 180-day period, the department head must file with the attorney general a statement describing the criminal investigation and its objectives within 180 days after the date the act complained of occurred.</p>

(a)  In this section:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  "Complainant" means a person claiming to be the victim of misconduct by a fire fighter or police officer.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  "Investigation" means an administrative investigation, conducted by the municipality, of alleged misconduct by a fire fighter or police officer that could result in punitive action against that person.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  "Investigator" means an agent or employee of the municipality who is assigned to conduct an investigation.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  "Punitive action" means a disciplinary suspension, indefinite suspension, demotion in rank, reprimand, or any combination of those actions.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(5)  "Normally assigned working hours" includes those hours during which a fire fighter or police officer is actually at work or at the person's assigned place of work, but does not include any time when the person is off duty on authorized leave, including sick leave.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  An investigator may interrogate a fire fighter or police officer who is the subject of an investigation only during the fire fighter's or police officer's normally assigned working hours unless:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the seriousness of the investigation, as determined by the fire fighter's or police officer's department head or the department head's designee, requires interrogation at another time;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  the fire fighter or police officer is compensated for the interrogation time on an overtime basis.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  The department head may not consider work time missed from regular duties by a fire fighter or police officer due to participation in the conduct of an investigation in determining whether to impose a punitive action or in determining the severity of a punitive action.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  An investigator may not interrogate a fire fighter or police officer who is the subject of an investigation or conduct any part of the investigation at that person's home without that person's permission.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  A person may not be assigned to conduct an investigation if the person is the complainant, the ultimate decisionmaker regarding disciplinary action, or a person who has any personal involvement regarding the alleged misconduct.  A fire fighter or police officer who is the subject of an investigation has the right to inquire and, on inquiry, to be informed of the identities of each investigator participating in an interrogation of the fire fighter or police officer.  Not later than the 30th day after the date that a complaint is received by an investigator, the investigator must inform the fire fighter in writing of the nature of the investigation and the name of each person who complained about the fire fighter, if known, concerning the matters under investigation unless:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  a criminal investigation has been initiated as a result of the complaint; or</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  the disclosure of information concerning the name of the complainant or the matters under investigation would hinder a criminal investigation.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  Before an investigator may interrogate a fire fighter or police officer who is the subject of an investigation, the investigator must inform the fire fighter or police officer in writing of the nature of the investigation and the name of each person who complained about the fire fighter or police officer concerning the matters under investigation.  An investigator may not conduct an interrogation of a fire fighter or police officer based on a complaint by a complainant who is not a peace officer unless the complainant verifies the complaint in writing before a public officer who is authorized by law to take statements under oath.  In an investigation authorized under this subsection, an investigator may interrogate a fire fighter or police officer about events or conduct reported by a witness who is not a complainant without disclosing the name of the witness.  Not later than the 48th hour before the hour on which an investigator begins to interrogate a fire fighter or police officer regarding an allegation based on a complaint, affidavit, or statement, the investigator shall give the fire fighter or police officer a copy of the affidavit, complaint, or statement. An interrogation may be based on a complaint from an anonymous complainant if the departmental employee receiving the anonymous complaint certifies in writing, under oath, that the complaint was anonymous.  This subsection does not apply to an on-the-scene investigation that occurs immediately after an incident being investigated if the limitations of this subsection would unreasonably hinder the essential purpose of the investigation or interrogation.  If the limitation would hinder the investigation or interrogation, the fire fighter or police officer under investigation must be furnished, as soon as practicable, a written statement of the nature of the investigation, the name of each complaining party, and the complaint, affidavit, or statement.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  An interrogation session of a fire fighter or police officer who is the subject of an investigation may not be unreasonably long.  In determining reasonableness, the gravity and complexity of the investigation must be considered.  The investigators shall allow reasonable interruptions to permit the fire fighter or police officer to attend to personal physical necessities.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  An investigator may not threaten a fire fighter or police officer who is the subject of an investigation with punitive action during an interrogation.  However, an investigator may inform a fire fighter or police officer that failure to truthfully answer reasonable questions directly related to the investigation or to fully cooperate in the conduct of the investigation may result in punitive action.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  If prior notification of intent to record an interrogation is given to the other party, either the investigator or the fire fighter or police officer who is the subject of an interrogation may record the interrogation.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  If an investigation does not result in punitive action against a fire fighter or police officer but does result in a reprimand recorded in writing or an adverse finding or determination regarding that person, the reprimand, finding, or determination may not be placed in that person's personnel file unless the fire fighter or police officer is first given an opportunity to read and sign the document.  If the fire fighter or police officer refuses to sign the reprimand, finding, or determination, it may be placed in the personnel file with a notation that the person refused to sign it.  A fire fighter or police officer may respond in writing to a reprimand, finding, or determination that is placed in the person's personnel file under this subsection by submitting a written response to the department head within 10 days after the date the fire fighter or police officer is asked to sign the document.  The response shall be placed in the personnel file.  A fire fighter or police officer who receives a punitive action and who elects not to appeal the action may file a written response as prescribed by this subsection within 10 days after the date the person is given written notice of the punitive action from the department head.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  If the department head or any investigator violates any of the provisions of this section while conducting an investigation, the municipality shall reverse any punitive action taken pursuant to the investigation including a reprimand, and any information obtained during the investigation shall be specifically excluded from introduction into evidence in any proceeding against the fire fighter or police officer.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(l)  Deleted by Acts 1989, 71st Leg., ch. 1, Sec. 25(h), eff.

A term or condition on which the public employer and the association do not agree is governed by the applicable statutes, local ordinances, and civil service rules.  An agreement must be reduced to writing.

The police employee group shall pay the costs of the election, except that if two or more police employee groups seeking recognition as the bargaining agent submit petitions signed by a majority of the police officers eligible to sign the petition, the police employee groups shall share equally the costs of the election.
