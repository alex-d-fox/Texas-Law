(a)  Each regulatory agency shall consider the approval, disapproval, or conditional approval of an application for a permit solely on the basis of any orders, regulations, ordinances, rules, expiration dates, or other properly adopted requirements in effect at the time:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the original application for the permit is filed for review for any purpose, including review for administrative completeness; or</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  a plan for development of real property or plat application is filed with a regulatory agency.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(a-1)  Rights to which a permit applicant is entitled under this chapter accrue on the filing of an original application or plan for development or plat application that gives the regulatory agency fair notice of the project and the nature of the permit sought.  An application or plan is considered filed on the date the applicant delivers the application or plan to the regulatory agency or deposits the application or plan with the United States Postal Service by certified mail addressed to the regulatory agency.  A certified mail receipt obtained by the applicant at the time of deposit is prima facie evidence of the date the application or plan was deposited with the United States Postal Service.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  If a series of permits is required for a project, the orders, regulations, ordinances, rules, expiration dates, or other properly adopted requirements in effect at the time the original application for the first permit in that series is filed shall be the sole basis for consideration of all subsequent permits required for the completion of the project.  All permits required for the project are considered to be a single series of permits.  Preliminary plans and related subdivision plats, site plans, and all other development permits for land covered by the preliminary plans or subdivision plats are considered collectively to be one series of permits for a project.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  After an application for a project is filed, a regulatory agency may not shorten the duration of any permit required for the project.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, a permit holder may take advantage of recorded subdivision plat notes, recorded restrictive covenants required by a regulatory agency, or a change to the laws, rules, regulations, or ordinances of a regulatory agency that enhance or protect the project, including changes that lengthen the effective life of the permit after the date the application for the permit was made, without forfeiting any rights under this chapter.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  A regulatory agency may provide that a permit application expires on or after the 45th day after the date the application is filed if:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the applicant fails to provide documents or other information necessary to comply with the agency's technical requirements relating to the form and content of the permit application;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  the agency provides to the applicant not later than the 10th business day after the date the application is filed written notice of the failure that specifies the necessary documents or other information and the date the application will expire if the documents or other information is not provided; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  the applicant fails to provide the specified documents or other information within the time provided in the notice.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  This chapter does not prohibit a regulatory agency from requiring compliance with technical requirements relating to the form and content of an application in effect at the time the application was filed even though the application is filed after the date an applicant accrues rights under Subsection (a-1).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  Notwithstanding Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&amp;Value=245.003">245.003</a>, the change in law made to Subsection (a) and the addition of Subsections (a-1), (e), and (f) by S.B.
