FLOOD CONTROL PROPERTY;  CONDEMNATION.  (a)  A county may acquire public or private real property, including easements and rights-of-way, for the purpose of building canals, drains, levees, and other improvements to provide for flood control and water outlets.  The county has the right of eminent domain to make an acquisition under this section.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  An appeal from a finding and assessment of damages by special commissioners in a condemnation case does not act to suspend the work for which the property is acquired.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  A county may, if the commissioners court of the county considers it necessary, obtain the fee title to the property that is the subject of the condemnation.  However, a county may not obtain through condemnation the fee title to property lawfully used or occupied by a public utility, railroad, canal, levee, or any other person devoting its property to a public use.  This prohibition does not prevent the county from condemning an easement or a right-of-way in favor of the county.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  If the commissioners court considers it necessary to condemn an easement on the property of a person that also has the power of eminent domain, the expense of acquisition, construction, and maintenance of the flood control or drainage project is the obligation of the county, flood control district, or drainage district, as the case may be.</p>
