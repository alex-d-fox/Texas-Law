(a)  The legislature finds that slum and blighted areas exist in municipalities in this state and that those areas:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  are a serious and growing menace that is injurious and inimical to the public health, safety, morals, and welfare of the residents of this state;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  contribute substantially and increasingly to the spread of disease and crime, requiring excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for the preservation of the public health and safety, and for crime prevention, correctional facilities, prosecution and punishment, treatment of juvenile delinquency, and the maintenance of adequate police, fire, and accident protection and other public services and facilities;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  constitute an economic and social liability, substantially impair the sound growth of affected municipalities, and retard the provision of housing accommodations.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  For these reasons, prevention and elimination of slum and blighted areas are matters of state policy and concern that may be best addressed by the combined action of private enterprise, municipal regulation, and other public action through approved urban renewal plans.  The legislature further finds that the repair and rehabilitation of buildings and other improvements in affected areas, public acquisition of real property, demolition of buildings and other improvements as necessary to eliminate slum or blight conditions or to prevent the spread of those conditions, the disposition of property acquired in affected areas and incidental to the purposes stated by this subsection, and other public assistance to eliminate those conditions are public purposes for which public money may be spent and the power of eminent domain exercised.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  It is the intent of the legislature that private enterprise be encouraged to participate in accomplishing the objectives of urban renewal to the extent of its capacity and with governmental assistance as provided by this chapter.</p>

A property owner may contest before the governing body any exercise of eminent domain authority that affects that person's individual ownership and may appeal to the district court.  The review on appeal is by trial de novo.</p>

In determining the fair value, the municipality shall consider:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the uses provided in the urban renewal plan;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  any restrictions on and any covenants, conditions, and obligations assumed by the purchaser, lessee, or municipality in retaining the property;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  the objectives of the plan for the prevention of the recurrence of slums or blighted areas;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  any other matters that the municipality specifies as appropriate.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  The municipality or urban renewal agency may provide in an instrument of conveyance to a private purchaser or lessee that the purchaser or lessee may sell any or all of the unimproved property without profit to the seller.  After improving a parcel of real property in accordance with the development plan adopted for the area, the purchaser may sell the parcel before completion of the development of the area or tract purchased, but the sale does not relieve that purchaser from the obligation of completing the development of that area or tract.  The purchaser may sell a parcel of land purchased for redevelopment to another person who is obligated to improve the parcel as provided by the development plan for that project if the resale is without profit to the seller and if any subsequent purchaser is required to improve the property as provided by the urban renewal plan and by the conditions contained in the deed of conveyance.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  A municipality shall sell real property acquired by the municipality that is to be sold to private developers in accordance with the urban renewal plan as rapidly as is feasible in the public interest and consistent with the goals of the urban renewal plan.  An instrument executed by a municipality or by an urban renewal agency that purports to convey any right, title, or interest in any property under this chapter is presumed to be executed in compliance with this chapter with respect to the title or interest of any bona fide lessee, transferee, or purchaser of the property.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  A municipality that sells real property in an urban renewal area to a private person must conduct the sale through competitive sealed bids after advertising the offer in the official publication or a newspaper of general circulation.  The advertisement must be published once before the 15th day before the date of the sale and must invite bids for the purchase of real property in the urban renewal area either in whole or in parcels as determined by the municipality.  Before advertising for bids, the municipality shall adopt as part of the specifications in the general plan of improvement any conditions binding on the purchaser or the purchaser's successors in title, including heirs and assignees.  The municipality or urban renewal agency may accept the highest and best responsible bid.  The purchase price must be paid in cash.  If the municipality or agency determines that the bids received are not satisfactory, it may reject all the bids and readvertise the offer.  The urban renewal agency may not sell the property until the price and conditions of sale are approved by the governing body of the municipality.  The municipality shall sell any real property acquired in connection with an urban renewal and rehabilitation project within a reasonable time for the purposes applicable to each project, except for the property retained by the municipality for public use.  Property to be resold shall be sold within a reasonable time, taking into account the general economic situation at the time of sale.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  The municipality may temporarily lease any real property acquired in an urban renewal area, except property that is not fit for human habitation or that is declared substandard by any governmental agency.  The lease must provide for a right of cancellation that permits the municipality to sell or dispose of the property for the purposes of this chapter.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  The former owner of any real property that is acquired under this chapter and that is not dedicated within a reasonable time to the purposes applicable to the urban renewal project for which it was acquired is entitled, after notice, to repurchase the property at the price for which it was acquired, less any actual damages sustained by the former owner because of the taking of the property, unless the property is devoted to the urban renewal purposes within 60 days after the date the former owner gives the record owner and the municipality written notice of the intention to exercise the right of repurchase.  After a repurchase, any buildings placed on or allowed to remain on the property must conform to the pattern and intent of the urban renewal project if the project is completed.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  Any purchaser or lessee who is a private developer of any part of the real property acquired under this chapter may use that property as security to finance the development of the property.  The purchaser or lessee may execute and deliver to a lender notes, deeds of trust with powers of sale, mortgages, and other instruments required in connection with obtaining and securing the repayment of the loan.  The purchaser or lessee has all the rights, titles, and incidents of ownership available to a purchaser or lessee of land generally, and the person is entitled to mortgage and encumber the property for either the purchase price or for improvements in accordance with the objectives of this chapter.  Any subsequent owner or lessee who acquires title through foreclosure of a lien given to secure the indebtedness or through a conveyance or assignment in satisfaction of debt takes title subject only to the restrictive covenants related to the use and improvement of the land that are contained in the original conveyance from the municipality.  The owner's or lessee's interest is not subject to any condition precedent or condition subsequent that would result in reverter or forfeiture of title or to any restraint as to the amount for which the property may be resold or leased.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or of any other law relating to competitive bid requirements, a municipality or urban renewal agency may sell urban renewal land for uses in accordance with an urban renewal plan to a public or private nonprofit corporation or foundation.  The sale must be for at least the fair market value of the land as determined by the municipality or urban renewal agency.</p>

(a)  A tax increment is computed by multiplying the total in property taxes levied and collected by the municipality and all other taxing entities on the taxable real property in an urban renewal project area in a year by a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to that year's market value of all taxable real property in the area minus the tax increment base and the denominator of which is equal to that year's market value of all taxable real property in the area.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  For the purposes of this chapter, only the tax assessor-collector determines the market value of property located in an urban renewal project area during the time that the project exists.  The determination requires the concurrence of the comptroller.  A property owner who is aggrieved by a determination of the tax assessor-collector has the same right of appeal as that provided by law to owners of property not affected by this chapter.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  At the time an urban renewal project is designated by the governing body, the tax assessor-collector shall, with the concurrence of the comptroller, certify to the governing body the market value of property within the boundaries of the urban renewal district.  The tax assessor-collector shall include at its most recently determined market value any property that is taxable at the time that the urban renewal project is designated and shall include at zero any property that is exempt from taxation at the time that the district is designated.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  The tax assessor-collector shall annually certify to the governing body the amount of the captured market value of property within the boundaries of the district and the amount of tax increments produced from that captured market value.  The tax assessor-collector shall make the initial certification not later than one year from the date on which an urban renewal project is designated.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  For any year in which taxes are to be paid into the tax increment fund established under Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&amp;Value=374.032">374.032</a>, a taxing entity may not consider any captured market value with respect to an urban renewal project in computing a debt limitation or for any other purpose except to determine the amount to be paid into the tax increment fund.</p>

On the approval of two-thirds of the qualified voters of the municipality, the municipality may also issue refunding bonds for the payment or retirement of tax increment bonds previously issued by the municipality.  The tax increment bonds may be made payable, both as to principal and interest, only from:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  tax increments allocated to and paid into the tax increment fund established by the municipality under Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&amp;Value=374.032">374.032</a>;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  private sources;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  contributions or other financial assistance from this state or the United States;  or</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  a combination of those methods.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  A tax increment bond issued under this section, with the interest and income from the bond, is exempt from taxation.

The bond is an authorized security for a public deposit.  Any person may use funds owned or controlled by the person to purchase those bonds.  This subsection does not relieve a person of a duty to exercise reasonable care in selecting securities.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  Tax increment bonds may be paid only out of the tax increment fund established under Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&amp;Value=374.032">374.032</a>.  The governing body of the municipality may irrevocably pledge all or part of the fund to the payment of those bonds or notes.  The fund or the designated part of the fund may only be used for the payment of those bonds and interest on those bonds until they have been fully paid.  A holder of those bonds or coupons relating to the bonds has a lien against the fund for the payment of the bonds or notes and the interest on them and may protect and enforce that lien by an action at law or in equity.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  To increase the security and marketability of tax increment bonds, the municipality, according to its best judgment, may:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  create a lien for the benefit of the bondholders on a public improvement or public work financed by the bonds or on the revenue from the public improvement or public work;  or</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  make covenants and take other action as necessary, convenient, or desirable to additionally secure the bonds or make the bonds more marketable.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  A tax increment bond issued under this section is not a general obligation of the municipality, is not a charge against its general credit or taxing powers, and is not payable other than as provided by this chapter.
