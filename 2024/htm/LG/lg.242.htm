If a municipal regulation and a county regulation relating to plats and subdivisions of land conflict, the more stringent regulation prevails.  However, if one governmental entity requires a plat to be filed for the subdivision of a particular tract of land in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the municipality and the other governmental entity does not require the filing of a plat for that subdivision, the authority responsible for approving plats for the governmental entity that does not require the filing shall issue on request of the subdivider a written certification stating that a plat is not required to be filed for that subdivision of the land.  The certification must be attached to a plat required to be filed under this subsection.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  Property subject to pending approval of a preliminary or final plat application filed after September 1, 2002, that is released from the extraterritorial jurisdiction of a municipality shall be subject only to county approval of the plat application and related permits and county regulation of that plat.
