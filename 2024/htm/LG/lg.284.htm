(a)  The legislature finds that:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  network nodes are instrumental to increasing access to advanced technology and information for the citizens of this state and thereby further an important public policy of having reliable wireless networks and services;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  this state has delegated to each municipality the fiduciary duty, as a trustee, to manage the public right-of-way for the health, safety, and welfare of the public, subject to state law;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  network nodes often may be deployed most effectively in the public right-of-way;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  network providers' access to the public right-of-way and the ability to attach network nodes to poles and structures in the public right-of-way allow network providers to densify their networks and provide next-generation services;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(5)  expeditious processes and reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms, conditions, and compensation for use of the public right-of-way for network node deployments are essential to state-of-the-art wireless services and thereby further an important public policy of having reliable wireless networks and services;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(6)  network nodes help ensure that this state remains competitive in the global economy;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(7)  the timely permitting of network nodes in the public right-of-way is a matter of statewide concern and interest;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(8)  requirements of this chapter regarding fees, charges, rates, and public right-of-way management, when considered with fees charged to other public right-of-way users under this code, are fair and reasonable and in compliance with 47 U.S.C.
