The provider shall pay those fees for the duration of that agreement or ordinance or until the right-of-way fees established by commission rule take effect.  If the existing franchise agreement or ordinance contains a provision requiring in-kind services or facilities, the certificated telecommunications provider not subject to an existing franchise agreement or ordinance shall pay an amount equal to an additional one percent of its total fees under the applicable agreement or ordinance in lieu of any in-kind services or facilities, if any, that otherwise are required under the terms of the existing franchise agreement or ordinance.

On request of the certificated telecommunications provider not subject to an existing franchise agreement or ordinance, the commission shall convert the compensation under the existing franchise agreement or ordinance to a fee per access line on a competitively neutral and non-discriminatory basis, and the certificated telecommunications provider may elect to pay the municipality on a fee per access line basis rather than the manner of compensation provided under the existing franchise agreement or ordinance.</p>

(a)  Not later than November 1, 1999, the commission shall establish not more than three categories of access lines for statewide use.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  Not later than March 1, 2000, the commission shall establish:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  for each municipality, rates per access line by category for the use of the rights-of-way in that municipality;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  the statewide average of those rates per access line by category for each certificated telecommunications provider, if necessary.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  The rates when applied to the total number of access lines by category in the municipality shall be equal to the base amount.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  Not later than December 1, 1999, a municipality that wants to effect an allocation of the base amount over specific access line categories to be assessed rates shall notify the commission of the desired allocation.  The commission shall establish an allocation of the base amount over the categories of access lines if a municipality does not file its proposed allocation by December 1, 1999.  A municipality may request a modification of the commission's allocation not more than once every 24 months by notifying the commission and all affected certificated telecommunications providers in September of that year that the municipality wants to change the allocation for the next calendar year.  A municipality's allocation shall be implemented unless, on complaint by an affected certificated telecommunications provider, the commission determines that the allocation is not just and reasonable, is not competitively neutral, or is discriminatory.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  Rates imposed under this section and the allocation among certificated telecommunications providers must be exercised in a competitively neutral manner, may not unduly impair competition, must be non-discriminatory, and must comply with state and federal law.  The commission shall determine the applicable rates for each municipality for each category, taking into account the allocation under Subsection (d) and the type, use, and function of access lines.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  Certificated telecommunications providers shall pay to the municipality a quarterly amount calculated monthly based on the access line rates established by the commission under this section and the number of access lines as reflected in the reports filed under Subsection (j).  The providers shall make the quarterly payment not later than 45 days after the end of the quarter.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  Beginning 24 months after the date the commission establishes rates per access line, the commission shall annually adjust the rates per access line for each municipality by an amount equal to one-half the annual change, if any, in the consumer price index.  At that time, the commission shall provide each certificated telecommunications provider and municipality with the adjusted monthly rates for each category of access line.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  On an annual basis, an affected municipality may provide notice to the commission to decline all or any portion of any increase in the per category access line rates.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  A certificated telecommunications provider may not be required to remit a right-of-way fee to a municipality on those access lines that have been resold, leased, or otherwise provided to another certificated telecommunications provider, if the underlying certificated telecommunications provider supplying those services or facilities has been furnished with adequate proof that the provider of services to the end-use customer will directly remit to the municipality a right-of-way fee based on those access lines.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  On a quarterly basis, each certificated telecommunications provider shall file a report with the commission that shows the number of access lines, including access lines by category, that the provider has within each municipality at the end of each month of the quarter.  The provider shall include with the report a certified statement from an authorized officer or duly authorized representative of the provider stating that the information contained in the report is true and correct to the best of the officer's or representative's knowledge and belief after inquiry.

A provider may not include in its monthly count of access lines and is not required to remit a right-of-way fee to the municipality on access lines that are resold, leased, or otherwise provided to another certificated telecommunications provider if the provider receives adequate proof that the provider leasing or purchasing the access lines will include the access lines in its monthly count and remit payment on those access lines to the municipality.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(l)  The commission may use a report required under Subsection (j) only to verify the number of access lines that serve premises within the municipality.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(m)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, payment by a certificated telecommunications provider that complies with the terms of an unexpired franchise agreement or right-of-way ordinance that applies to the provider satisfies the payment attributable to the provider required by this chapter.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(n)  A municipality may not demand or require from a certificated telecommunications provider services, facilities, or goods without compensation or at below-market rates.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(o)  A certificated telecommunications provider shall, to the extent required, implement commission established access line rates not later than the 90th day after the date the commission establishes the access line rates under this chapter.</p>

(a)  A municipality may not require a certificated telecommunications provider to:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  pay any compensation other than the fee authorized by Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&amp;Value=283.055">283.055</a>, including an application, permit, excavation, or inspection fee, for the right to use a public right-of-way to provide telecommunications services in the municipality;  or</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  provide any services or facilities for the right to use a public right-of-way or to provide telecommunications services in the municipality.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  Notwithstanding any other law or any other provision of this chapter, a municipality may require the issuance of a construction permit without cost to a certificated telecommunications provider locating facilities in or on public rights-of-way within the municipality.  The terms of the permit shall be consistent with construction permits issued to other persons excavating in a public right-of-way.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  A municipality may exercise those police power-based regulations in the management of a public right-of-way that apply to all persons within the municipality.  A municipality may exercise police power-based regulations in the management of the activities of certificated telecommunications providers within a public right-of-way only to the extent that they are reasonably necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public.  Police power-based regulation of certificated telecommunications providers may not include activities that are governed by this chapter or are within the sole business discretion of the certificated telecommunications provider.  In addition, any police power-based regulation must be competitively neutral and may not be unreasonable or discriminatory.  A municipality specifically may not impose regulations on certificated telecommunications providers that are not authorized by this chapter, including:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  requirements that particular business offices be located in the municipality;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  requirements for filing reports and documents with the municipality that are not required by state law to be filed with the municipality and that are not related to the use of a public right-of-way;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  inspection of a provider's business records except to the extent necessary to conduct an authorized review of the provider to ensure compliance with the access line reporting requirements of this chapter if commenced within 90 days after the filing of a certificated telecommunications provider's report of access lines;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  approval of transfers of ownership or control of a provider's business, except that a municipality may require that a provider maintain current point of contact information and provide notice of a transfer within a reasonable time.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  In the exercise of its lawful regulatory authority, a municipality shall promptly process each valid and administratively complete application of a certificated telecommunications provider for any permit, license, or consent to excavate, set poles, locate lines, construct facilities, make repairs, affect traffic flow, obtain zoning or subdivision regulation approvals, or for other similar approvals, and shall make every reasonable effort to not delay or unduly burden that provider in the timely conduct of its business.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  If there is an emergency necessitating response work or repair, a certificated telecommunications provider may begin that repair or emergency response work or take any action required under the circumstances, provided that the certificated telecommunications provider notifies the affected municipality as promptly as possible after beginning the work and later acquires any approval required by a municipal ordinance applicable to emergency response work.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  The compensation paid under this chapter is in lieu of any permit, license, approval, inspection, or other similar fee or charge, including all general business license fees customarily assessed by a municipality for the use of a public right-of-way against persons operating telecommunications-related businesses.  The compensation paid under this chapter constitutes full compensation to a municipality for all of a certificated telecommunications provider's facilities located within a public right-of-way, including interoffice transport and other transmission media that do not terminate at an end-use customer's premises, even though those types of lines are not used in the calculation of the compensation.  This chapter may not be construed to affect the ad valorem taxation of a certificated telecommunications provider's facilities or to permit the ad valorem taxation of a certificated telecommunication provider's occupancy of a public right-of-way.</p>
