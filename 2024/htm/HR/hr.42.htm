The purpose of this chapter is to protect the health, safety, and well-being of the children of the state who reside in child-care facilities by establishing statewide minimum standards for their safety and protection and by regulating the facilities through a licensing program.  It is the policy of the state to ensure the protection of all children under care in child-care facilities and to encourage and assist in the improvement of child-care programs.  It is also the intent of the legislature that freedom of religion of all citizens is inviolate.  With respect to a school or child-care facility sponsored by a religious organization, nothing in this chapter gives a governmental agency authority to regulate, control, supervise, or in any way be involved in the:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  form, manner, or content of religious instruction, ministry, teaching, or the curriculum offered by the school or facility;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  ability of the school or facility to select and supervise qualified personnel, and otherwise control the terms of employment, including the right to employ individuals who share the religious views of the school or facility;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  internal self-governance and autonomy of the school or facility; or</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  religious environment of the school or facility, such as symbols, art, icons, and scripture.</p>
