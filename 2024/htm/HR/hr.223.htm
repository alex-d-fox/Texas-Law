(a)  The department shall annually allocate funds for financial assistance to juvenile boards to provide juvenile services according to current estimates of the number of juveniles in each county, a basic probation funding formula for departments that clearly defines what basic probation entails and which services are provided, and other factors the department determines are appropriate.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(a-1)  The department may incorporate as factors in the basic probation funding formula under Subsection (a) measures that create incentives for diverting children from the juvenile justice system.  The department may prioritize factors for which the department collects relevant information.  The board may adopt rules establishing and defining the factors under this subsection.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(a-2)  When revising the basic probation funding formula under Subsection (a), the department shall consult and coordinate with relevant stakeholders, including:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the advisory council on juvenile services; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  the Legislative Budget Board.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  The legislature may appropriate the amount of state aid necessary to supplement local funds to maintain and improve statewide juvenile services that comply with department standards and to initiate and support the regionalization plan under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HR&amp;Value=203.017">203.017</a> so that savings are generated by decreases in the population of department facilities operated under Subtitle C.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  The department shall set aside a portion of the funds appropriated to the department for discretionary state aid to fund programs designed to address special needs or projects of local juvenile boards, including projects dedicated to specific target populations based on risk and needs, and with established recidivism reduction goals.  The department shall develop discretionary grant funding protocols based on documented, data-driven, and research-based practices.  The department may incorporate incentives into the discretionary grant funding protocols that encourage collaboration between juvenile probation departments.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  The department shall reimburse counties for the placement of children in the regional specialized program at a rate that offers a savings to the state in relation to the average cost per day for confining a child in a department facility operated under Subtitle C.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d-1)  The board, in consultation with the advisory council on juvenile services, shall adopt rules requiring a juvenile probation department to apply for the placement of a child in a regional specialized program before a juvenile court commits the child to the department's custody under Chapter <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&amp;Value=54">54</a>, Family Code.  The board by rule may establish exceptions to this requirement for offenses or circumstances the department considers inappropriate for diversion from commitment to state custody.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  The department may not adversely impact the state aid for a juvenile board or a juvenile probation department that does not enter into a contract to serve youth from other counties, or does not act as a regional facility.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  A juvenile board or juvenile probation department may not be required to accept a child for placement in a post-adjudication correctional facility, unless the child is subject to an order issued by a juvenile court served by that board or department.</p>
