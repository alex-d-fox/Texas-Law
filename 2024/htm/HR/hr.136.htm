PURPOSE.  The legislature finds that:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  community health centers play a significant role in the delivery of medical care and related services to the residents of this state who cannot afford health insurance;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  community health centers are a cost-effective way to provide primary and preventive health care to populations lacking quality health care by reducing hospitalizations and the inappropriate use of emergency rooms;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  the financing sources available for the capital needs of community health centers, such as buildings and equipment, are inadequate;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  increasing community health centers' access to capital would benefit residents of this state in poor and underserved communities and foreign-born residents who are uninsured, by providing greater access to primary care and preventive health services and by targeting the common health problems of these residents.</p>
