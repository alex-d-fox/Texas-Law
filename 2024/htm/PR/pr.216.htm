(a)  The legislature finds that:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the inability of owners to extend or amend property restrictions in older subdivisions in which no zoning regulations apply creates uncertainty in living conditions and discourages investments in those subdivisions;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  owners in affected older subdivisions are reluctant or unable to provide proper maintenance, upkeep, and repairs of structures because of the inability to amend the restrictions in response to changing circumstances;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  these conditions will cause dilapidation of housing and other structures and cause unhealthful and unsanitary conditions in affected older subdivisions, contrary to the health, safety, and welfare of the public; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  the existence of race-related covenants in restrictions, regardless of their unenforceability, is offensive, repugnant, and harmful to members of racial or ethnic minority groups and public policy requires that those covenants be removed.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  The purpose of this chapter is to provide a procedure for extending or amending restrictions for certain older subdivisions, including the removal of any restriction relating to race, religion, or national origin that is void and unenforceable under the United States Constitution or Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&amp;Value=5.026">5.026</a>.</p>
