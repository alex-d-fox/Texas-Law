If neither box is checked, you should assume the dwelling is in a 100-year floodplain.  Even if the dwelling is not in a 100-year floodplain, the dwelling may still be susceptible to flooding. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) maintains a flood map on its Internet website that is searchable by address, at no cost, to determine if a dwelling is located in a flood hazard area.

You should seek insurance coverage that would cover losses caused by a flood."</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  Notwithstanding Subsection (b), a landlord is not required to disclose on the notice that the landlord is aware that a dwelling is located in a 100-year floodplain if the elevation of the dwelling is raised above the 100-year floodplain flood levels in accordance with federal regulations.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  If a landlord knows that flooding has damaged any portion of a dwelling at least once during the five-year period immediately preceding the effective date of the lease, the landlord shall provide a written notice to a tenant that is substantially equivalent to the following:</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">"(Landlord) ( ) is or ( ) is not aware that the dwelling you are renting has flooded at least once within the last five years."</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  The notices required by Subsections (b) and (d) must be included in a separate written document given to the tenant at or before execution of the lease.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  If a landlord violates this section and a tenant suffers a substantial loss or damage to the tenant's personal property as a result of flooding, the tenant may terminate the lease by giving a written notice of termination to the landlord not later than the 30th day after the date the loss or damage occurred.  For purposes of this subsection, a tenant suffers a substantial loss or damage to personal property if the total cost of repairs to or replacement of the personal property is 50 percent or more of the personal property's market value on the date the flooding occurred.
