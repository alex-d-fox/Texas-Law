(a)  Unless the declaration provides otherwise and except for a taking of all the units by condemnation, a condominium may be terminated only by the agreement of 100 percent of the votes in the association and each holder of a deed of trust or vendor's lien on a unit.  The declaration may not allow a termination by less than 80 percent of the votes in the association if any unit is restricted exclusively to residential uses.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  An agreement of unit owners to terminate a condominium must be evidenced by the execution or ratification of a termination agreement by the requisite number of unit owners.  If, pursuant to a termination agreement, the real property constituting the condominium is to be sold following termination, the termination agreement must set forth the terms of the sale.  To be effective, a termination agreement and all ratifications of the agreement must be recorded in each county in which a portion of the condominium is located.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  The association, on behalf of the unit owners, may contract for the sale of real property in the condominium, but the contract is not binding on the unit owners until it is approved under Subsections (a) and (b).  If the real property constituting the condominium is to be sold following termination, on termination title to that real property vests in the association as trustee for the holders of all interests in the units, and the association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the sale, including the power to convey the interests of nonconsenting owners.  Until the sale has been concluded and the proceeds distributed, the association shall continue to exist and retains the powers it had before termination.  Proceeds of the sale must be distributed to unit owners and lienholders as their interests may appear, in proportion to the respective interests of unit owners as provided by Subsection (f).  Unless the termination agreement specifies differently, as long as the association holds title to the real property, each unit owner and the owner's successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupy the portion of the real property that formerly constituted the owner's unit.  During that period of occupancy a unit owner and the owner's successors in interest remain liable for all assessments and other obligations imposed on unit owners by this chapter or the declaration.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  If the real property constituting the condominium is not to be sold following termination, on termination title to the real property vests in the unit owners as tenants in common in proportion to their respective interests, and liens on the units shift accordingly.  While the tenancy in common exists, a unit owner and the owner's successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupy the portion of the real property that formerly constituted the owner's unit.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  Following termination of the condominium, and after payment of or provision for the claims of the association's creditors, the assets of the association shall be distributed to unit owners in proportion to their respective interests.  The proceeds of sale described by Subsection (c) and held by the association as trustee are not assets of the association.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  The interest of a unit owner referred to in Subsections (c), (d), and (e) is, except as provided by Subsection (g), the fair market value of the owner's unit, limited common elements, and common element interest immediately before the termination, as determined by one or more independent appraisers selected by the association.  The decision of the independent appraisers shall be distributed to the unit owners and becomes final unless disapproved by unit owners of units to which 25 percent of the votes in the association are allocated not later than the 30th day after the date of distribution.  The proportion of a unit owner's interest to that of all unit owners is determined by dividing the fair market value of the unit owner's unit and common element interest by the total fair market values of all the units and common elements.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  If a unit or a limited common element is destroyed to the extent that an appraisal of the fair market value before the destruction cannot be made, the interest of a unit owner is the owner's common element interest immediately before the termination.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  Foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against the entire condominium does not of itself terminate the condominium, and foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the condominium does not withdraw that portion from the condominium, unless the portion is withdrawable real property or unless the mortgage being foreclosed was recorded before the date the declaration was recorded and the mortgagee did not consent in writing to the declaration.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  By agreement of the same percentage of unit owners that is required to terminate the condominium, the unit owners may rescind a termination agreement and reinstate the declaration in effect immediately before the election to terminate.  To be effective, the rescission agreement must be in writing, executed by the unit owners who desire to rescind, and recorded in each county in which any portion of the condominium is located.</p>

This section does not affect the right of a holder of a mortgage on a unit to require a unit owner to acquire insurance in addition to that provided by the association.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  Insurance policies carried under Subsection (a) must provide that:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  each unit owner is an insured person under the policy with respect to liability arising out of the person's ownership of an undivided interest in the common elements or membership in the association;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  the insurer waives its right to subrogation under the policy against a unit owner;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  no action or omission of a unit owner, unless within the scope of the unit owner's authority on behalf of the association, will void the policy or be a condition to recovery under the policy;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  if, at the time of a loss under the policy, there is other insurance in the name of a unit owner covering the same property covered by the policy, the association's policy provides primary insurance.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  A claim for any loss covered by the policy under Subsection (a)(1) must be submitted by and adjusted with the association.

Each owner of a unit may vote, regardless of whether the owner's unit or limited common element has been damaged or destroyed.  A vote may be cast electronically or by written ballot if a meeting is not held for that purpose or in person or by proxy at a meeting called for that purpose.  A vote to not rebuild does not increase an insurer's liability to loss payment obligation under a policy, and the vote does not cause a presumption of total loss.  Except as provided by this section, the cost of repair or replacement in excess of the insurance proceeds is a common expense, and the board may levy an assessment to pay the expenses in accordance with each owner's common expense liability. If the entire condominium is not repaired or replaced, any insurance proceeds attributable to the damaged common elements shall be used to restore the damaged area to a condition compatible with the remainder of the condominium, the insurance proceeds attributable to units and limited common elements that are not rebuilt shall be distributed to the owners of those units and the owners of the units to which those limited common elements were assigned, or to their mortgagees, as their interests may appear, and the remainder of the proceeds shall be distributed to all the unit owners in accordance with each owner's undivided interest in the common elements unless otherwise provided in the declaration.  If the unit owners vote to not rebuild any unit, that unit's allocated interests shall be automatically reallocated on the vote as if the unit had been condemned, and the association shall prepare, execute, and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocation.  Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&amp;Value=82.068">82.068</a> governs the distribution of insurance proceeds if the condominium is terminated.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  If the cost to repair damage to a unit or common element covered by the association's insurance is less than the amount of the applicable insurance deductible,  the party who would be responsible for the repair in the absence of insurance shall pay the cost for the repair of the unit or common element.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  If the association's insurance provides coverage for the loss and the cost to repair the damage to a unit or common element is more than the amount of the applicable insurance deductible, the dedicatory instruments determine payment for the cost of the association's deductible and costs incurred before insurance proceeds are available.  If the dedicatory instruments are silent, the board of directors of the association by resolution shall determine the payment of those costs, or if the board does not approve a resolution, the costs are a common expense.

(a)  An assessment levied by the association against a unit or unit owner is a personal obligation of the unit owner and is secured by a continuing lien on the unit and on rents and insurance proceeds received by the unit owner and relating to the owner's unit.  In this section, "assessments" means regular and special assessments, dues, fees, charges, interest, late fees, fines, collection costs, attorney's fees, and any other amount due to the association by the unit owner or levied against the unit by the association, all of which are enforceable as assessments under this section unless the declaration provides otherwise.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  The association's lien for assessments has priority over any other lien except:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  a lien for real property taxes and other governmental assessments or charges against the unit unless otherwise provided by Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=32.05">32.05</a>, Tax Code;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  a lien or encumbrance recorded before the declaration is recorded;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  a first vendor's lien or first deed of trust lien recorded before the date on which the assessment sought to be enforced becomes delinquent under the declaration, bylaws, or rules;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  unless the declaration provides otherwise, a lien for construction of improvements to the unit or an assignment of the right to insurance proceeds on the unit if the lien or assignment is recorded or duly perfected before the date on which the assessment sought to be enforced becomes delinquent under the declaration, bylaws, or rules.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  The association's lien for assessments is created by recordation of the declaration, which constitutes record notice and perfection of the lien.  Unless the declaration provides otherwise, no other recordation of a lien or notice of lien is required.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  By acquiring a unit, a unit owner grants to the association a power of sale in connection with the association's lien.  By written resolution, a board may appoint, from time to time, an officer, agent, trustee, or attorney of the association to exercise the power of sale on behalf of the association.  Except as provided by the declaration, an association shall exercise its power of sale pursuant to Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&amp;Value=51.002">51.002</a>.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  The association has the right to foreclose its lien judicially or by nonjudicial foreclosure pursuant to the power of sale created by this chapter or the declaration, except that the association may not foreclose a lien for assessments consisting solely of fines.  Costs of foreclosure may be added to the amount owed by the unit owner to the association.  A unit owner may not petition a court to set aside a sale solely because the purchase price at the foreclosure sale was insufficient to fully satisfy the owner's debt.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  The association may bid for and purchase the unit at foreclosure sale as a common expense.  The association may own, lease, encumber, exchange, sell, or convey a unit.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  The owner of a unit purchased at a foreclosure sale of the association's lien for assessments may redeem the unit not later than the 90th day after the date of the foreclosure sale.  If the association is the purchaser, the owner must pay to the association to redeem the unit all amounts due the association at the time of the foreclosure sale, interest from the date of foreclosure sale to the date of redemption at the rate provided by the declaration for delinquent assessments, reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred by the association in foreclosing the lien, any assessment levied against the unit by the association after the foreclosure sale, and any reasonable cost incurred by the association as owner of the unit, including costs of maintenance and leasing.  If a party other than the association is the purchaser, the redeeming owner must pay to the purchaser of the unit at the foreclosure sale an amount equal to the amount bid at the sale, interest on the bid amount computed from the date of the foreclosure sale to the date of redemption at the rate of six percent, any assessment paid by the purchaser after the date of foreclosure, and any reasonable costs incurred by the purchaser as the owner of the unit, including costs of maintenance and leasing.  The redeeming owner must also pay to the association all assessments that are due as of the date of the redemption and reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred by the association in foreclosing the lien.  On redemption, the purchaser of the unit at the foreclosure sale shall execute a deed with no warranty to the redeeming unit owner.  The exercise of the right of redemption is not effective against a subsequent purchaser or lender for value without notice of the redemption after the redemption period expires unless the redeeming unit owner records the deed from the purchaser of the unit at the foreclosure sale or an affidavit stating that the owner has exercised the right of redemption.  A unit that has been redeemed remains subject to all liens and encumbrances on the unit before foreclosure.  All rents and other income collected from the unit by the purchaser of the unit at the foreclosure sale from the date of foreclosure sale to the date of redemption belong to the purchaser of the unit at the foreclosure sale, but the rents and income shall be credited against the redemption amount.  The purchaser of a unit at a sale foreclosing an association's assessment lien may not transfer ownership of the unit during the redemption period to a person other than a redeeming owner.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  If a unit owner defaults in the owner's monetary obligations to the association, the association may notify other lien holders of the default and the association's intent to foreclose its lien.  The association shall notify any holder of a recorded lien or duly perfected mechanic's lien against a unit who has given the association a written request for notification of the unit owner's monetary default or the association's intent to foreclose its lien.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  This section does not prohibit the association from taking a deed in lieu of foreclosure or from filing suit to recover a money judgment for sums that may be secured by the lien.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  At any time before a nonjudicial foreclosure sale, a unit owner may avoid foreclosure by paying all amounts due the association.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  If, on January 1, 1994, a unit is the homestead of the unit owner and is subject to a declaration that does not contain a valid assessment lien against the unit, the lien provided by this section does not attach against the unit until the unit ceases to be the homestead of the person owning it on January 1, 1994.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(l)  Foreclosure of a tax lien attaching against a unit under Chapter <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=32">32</a>, Tax Code, does not discharge the association's lien for assessments under this section or under a declaration for amounts becoming due to the association after the date of foreclosure of the tax lien.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(m)  If a unit owner is delinquent in payment of assessments to an association, at the request of the association a holder of a recorded lien against the unit may provide the association with information about the unit owner's debt secured by the holder's lien against the unit and other relevant information.  At the request of a lien holder, the association may furnish the lien holder with information about the condominium and the unit owner's obligations to the association.</p>

(a)  A loan on a condominium unit and the undivided interest in the common elements is an eligible investment for a bank, savings and loan association, trust company, life insurance company, or other lending institution that is authorized to make real property loans, and for an administrator, guardian, executor, trustee, individual, partnership, corporation, or other fiduciary that is authorized to make real property loans.  In determining eligibility, the existence of a prior lien for taxes, assessments, or other similar charges not yet delinquent may not be considered in determining whether a mortgage or deed of trust on the security is a first lien.  This section does not change any provision of law that would otherwise be applicable that limits mortgage investments based on a special fraction or percentage of the value of the mortgaged property.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  An association's lien for assessments does not make a condominium unit ineligible for loans for which the unit would otherwise qualify.</p>
