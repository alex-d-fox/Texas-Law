(a)  The legislature finds that:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the pending expiration of and the inability of owners to extend or modify property restrictions applicable to certain real estate subdivisions in this state creates uncertainty in living conditions and discourages investments in those subdivisions;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  owners of land in affected subdivisions are reluctant or unable to provide proper maintenance, upkeep, and repairs of structures because of the pending expiration of restrictions;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  financial institutions cannot or will not lend money for investments, maintenance, upkeep, or repairs in affected subdivisions;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  these conditions cause dilapidation of housing and other structures and cause unhealthful and unsanitary conditions in affected subdivisions, contrary to the health, safety, and welfare of the public; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(5)  the existence of race-related covenants in restrictions, regardless of their unenforceability, is offensive, repugnant, and harmful to members of racial or ethnic minority groups and public policy requires that those covenants be removed.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  The purpose of this chapter is to provide a procedure for extending or modifying residential restrictions and to provide for the removal of any restriction or other provision relating to race, religion, or national origin that is void and unenforceable under either the United States Constitution or Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&amp;Value=5.026">5.026</a>.</p>
