The tenant must also state orally under oath to the justice the facts of the alleged unlawful lockout.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  If the tenant has complied with Subsection (b) and if the justice reasonably believes an unlawful lockout has likely occurred, the justice may issue, ex parte, a writ of reentry that entitles the tenant to immediate and temporary possession of the premises, pending a final hearing on the tenant's sworn complaint for reentry.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  The writ of reentry must be served on either the landlord or the landlord's management company, on-premises manager, or rent collector in the same manner as a writ of possession in a forcible detainer action.  A sheriff or constable may use reasonable force in executing a writ of reentry under this section.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  The landlord is entitled to a hearing on the tenant's sworn complaint for reentry.  The writ of reentry must notify the landlord of the right to a hearing.

If the writ is disobeyed, the tenant or the tenant's attorney may file in the court in which the reentry action is pending an affidavit stating the name of the person who has disobeyed the writ and describing the acts or omissions constituting the disobedience.  On receipt of an affidavit, the justice shall issue a show cause order, directing the person to appear on a designated date and show cause why he should not be adjudged in contempt of court.  If the justice finds, after considering the evidence at the hearing, that the person has directly or indirectly disobeyed the writ, the justice may commit the person to jail without bail until the person purges himself of the contempt in a manner and form as the justice may direct.  If the person disobeyed the writ before receiving the show cause order but has complied with the writ after receiving the order, the justice may find the person in contempt and assess punishment under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&amp;Value=21.002">21.002</a>(c), Government Code.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  This section does not affect a tenant's right to pursue a separate cause of action under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&amp;Value=93.002">93.002</a>.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  If a tenant in bad faith files a sworn complaint for reentry resulting in a writ of reentry being served on the landlord or landlord's agent, the landlord may in a separate cause of action recover from the tenant an amount equal to actual damages, one month's rent or $500, whichever is greater, reasonable attorney's fees, and costs of court, less any sums for which the landlord is liable to the tenant.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(l)  The fee for filing a sworn complaint for reentry is the same as that for filing a civil action in justice court.  The fee for service of a writ of reentry is the same as that for service of a writ of possession.  The fee for service of a show cause order is the same as that for service of a civil citation.  The justice may defer payment of the tenant's filing fees and service costs for the sworn complaint for reentry and writ of reentry.  Court costs may be waived only if the tenant executes a pauper's affidavit.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(m)  This section does not affect the rights of a landlord or tenant in a forcible detainer or forcible entry and detainer action.</p>
