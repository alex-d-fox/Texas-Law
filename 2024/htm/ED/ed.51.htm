The legislature finds that higher education is vitally important to the welfare, if not the survival, of Texas and the United States at this stage in history and that the quality of higher education is dependent upon the quality of college and university faculties.  The legislature finds, therefore, that money spent on recognized means for producing an excellent system of public higher education is money spent to serve a public purpose of great importance.  The legislature finds further that a sound program of faculty development leaves of absence designed to enable the faculty member to engage in study, research, writing, and similar projects for the purpose of adding to the knowledge available to himself, his students, his institution, and society generally is a well-recognized means for improving a state's program of public higher education.  The legislature's purpose in establishing the faculty development leave program provided for by this subchapter is to improve further the higher education available to the youth at the state-supported colleges and universities and to establish this program of faculty development leaves as part of the plan of compensation for the faculty of these colleges and universities.</p>

LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.  The legislature finds that:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  strength in the manufacturing sector is critical to the United States' and Texas' international competitive position, as well as to the national security.  Manufacturing has the highest economic multiplier of any industrial sector, contributing to economic growth and personal wealth.  High technology manufacturing has the highest economic multiplier among manufacturing sectors;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  the health of the manufacturing sector is critical for economic growth in Texas.  Texas, as a primary producer of raw materials, finds itself positioned to benefit tremendously from improvement and development of its manufacturing capabilities, even while the Texas economy suffers the consequences of having depended too heavily on production of raw materials alone;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  manufacturing industry sales growth and productivity increases have been shown to move in direct relation to the performance of research and development by the industry.</p>

It is the intent of the legislature that Texas accept the challenge of becoming the nation's centerpoint for advanced manufacturing technology development by aggressively pursuing the siting in Texas of the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences, proposed by the National Academy of Sciences and the Manufacturing Science Board, and initiated by the National Machine Tool Industry.  With this centerpiece for advanced research and technology transfer in the area of manufacturing sciences, Texas could become a primary producer of high value-added products, with enormous benefits for the entire economy.</p>
