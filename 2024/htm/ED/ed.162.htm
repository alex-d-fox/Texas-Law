Waiver requirements--Local education agency administrative officials shall waive specific courses required for graduation if similar coursework has been satisfactorily completed in another local education agency or shall provide reasonable justification for denial.

In the event that one of the states in question is not a member of this compact, the member state shall use best efforts to facilitate the on-time graduation of the student in accordance with Sections A and B of this article.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">The Texas commissioner of education shall adopt a passing standard on one or more national norm-referenced achievement tests for purposes of permitting a student to whom this compact applies to meet that standard as a substitute for completing a specific course or achieving a score on an assessment instrument otherwise required by this state for graduation.  Each passing standard must be at least as rigorous as the applicable requirement otherwise imposed by this state for graduation, and be consistent with college readiness standards adopted under Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&amp;Value=28.008">28.008</a>, Texas Education Code.  Before adopting or revising a passing standard, the commissioner of education must consider any comments submitted by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board or the State Board of Education.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">A passing standard adopted by the commissioner of education is available only for a student who enrolls in a public school in this state for the first time after completing the ninth grade or who reenrolls in a public school in this state at or above the 10th grade level after an absence of at least two years from the public schools of this state.  Each passing standard in effect when a student first enrolls in a public high school in this state remains applicable to the student for the duration of the student's high school enrollment, regardless of any subsequent revision of the standard.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">The commissioner of education may adopt rules as necessary to implement the commissioner's duties and authority under this article of the compact.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board shall monitor the postsecondary educational performance in this state of students permitted to graduate in accordance with passing standards adopted by the commissioner of education for purposes of this compact.  Based on the educational performance of those students in private and public institutions, the coordinating board shall make recommendations to the commissioner of education regarding appropriate revisions of the passing standards.</p><p class="center">ARTICLE VIII.

Give public notice of all meetings and all meetings shall be open to the public, except as set forth in the rules or as otherwise provided in the compact.

Establishing the fiscal year of the Interstate Commission;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">2.  Establishing an executive committee, and such other committees as may be necessary;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">3.  Providing for the establishment of committees and for governing any general or specific delegation of authority or function of the Interstate Commission;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">4.  Providing reasonable procedures for calling and conducting meetings of the Interstate Commission, and ensuring reasonable notice of each such meeting;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">5.  Establishing the titles and responsibilities of the officers and staff of the Interstate Commission;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">6.  Providing a mechanism for concluding the operations of the Interstate Commission and the return of surplus funds that may exist upon the termination of the compact after the payment and reserving of all of its debts and obligations;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">7.

The Interstate Commission shall, by a majority of the members, elect annually from among its members a chairperson, a vice-chairperson, and a treasurer, each of whom shall have such authority and duties as may be specified in the bylaws.  The chairperson or, in the chairperson's absence or disability, the vice-chairperson, shall preside at all meetings of the Interstate Commission.  The officers so elected shall serve without compensation or remuneration from the Interstate Commission; provided that, subject to the availability of budgeted funds, the officers shall be reimbursed for ordinary and necessary costs and expenses incurred by them in the performance of their responsibilities as officers of the Interstate Commission.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">C.  Executive Committee, Officers, and Personnel</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">1.  The executive committee shall have such authority and duties as may be set forth in the bylaws, including but not limited to:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">a.  Managing the affairs of the Interstate Commission in a manner consistent with the bylaws and purposes of the Interstate Commission;</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">b.

The Interstate Commission is considered to be an instrumentality of the states for the purposes of any such action.  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to protect such person from suit or liability for damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or wilful and wanton misconduct of such person.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">2.

RULEMAKING FUNCTIONS OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION</p><br /><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">A.  Rulemaking Authority--The Interstate Commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of this compact.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Interstate Commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this Act, or the powers granted hereunder, then such an action by the Interstate Commission shall be invalid and have no force or effect.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">B.  Rulemaking Procedure--Rules shall be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that substantially conforms to the "Model State Administrative Procedure Act," of 1981 Act, Uniform Laws Annotated, Volume 15, page 1 (2000), as amended, as may be appropriate to the operations of the Interstate Commission.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">C.  Not later than thirty (30) days after a rule is promulgated, any person may file a petition for judicial review of the rule; provided, that the filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the rule from becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success.  The court shall give deference to the actions of the Interstate Commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the rule to be unlawful if the rule represents a reasonable exercise of the Interstate Commission's authority.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">D.  If a majority of the legislatures of the compacting states rejects a rule by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any compacting state.</p><p class="center">ARTICLE XIII.  OVERSIGHT, ENFORCEMENT, AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION</p><br /><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">A.  Oversight</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">1.  The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce this compact and shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact's purposes and intent.  The provisions of this compact and the rules promulgated hereunder shall have standing as statutory law.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">2.  All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the Interstate Commission.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">3.  The Interstate Commission shall be entitled to receive all service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes.  Failure to provide service of process to the Interstate Commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the Interstate Commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">B.  Default, Technical Assistance, Suspension, and Termination--If the Interstate Commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, or the bylaws or promulgated rules, the Interstate Commission shall:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">1.  Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states, of the nature of the default, the means of curing the default and any action taken by the Interstate Commission.  The Interstate Commission shall specify the conditions by which the defaulting state must cure its default.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">2.  Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">3.  If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination.  A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of the default.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">4.  Suspension or termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted.  Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Interstate Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member states.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">5.  The state which has been suspended or terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of suspension or termination including obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of suspension or termination.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">6.  The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to any state that has been found to be in default or which has been suspended or terminated from the compact, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the Interstate Commission and the defaulting state.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">7.  The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Interstate Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its principal offices.  The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney's fees.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">C.  Dispute Resolution</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">1.  The Interstate Commission shall attempt, upon the request of a member state, to resolve disputes which are subject to the compact and which may arise among member states and between member and non-member states.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">2.  The Interstate Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">D.  Enforcement</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">1.  The Interstate Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">2.  The Interstate Commission may, by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, in the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its principal offices, to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, its promulgated rules and bylaws, against a member state in default.  The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages.  In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney's fees.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">3.  The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Interstate Commission.  The Interstate Commission may avail itself of any other remedies available under state law or the regulation of a profession.</p><p class="center">ARTICLE XIV.  FINANCING OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION</p><br /><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">A.  The Interstate Commission shall pay, or provide for the payment of the reasonable expenses of its establishment, organization, and ongoing activities.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">B. The Interstate Commission may levy on and collect an annual assessment from each member state to cover the cost of the operations and activities of the Interstate Commission and its staff, which must be in a total amount sufficient to cover the Interstate Commission's annual budget as approved each year.  The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the Interstate Commission, which shall promulgate a rule binding upon all member states.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">C. The Interstate Commission shall not incur obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same; nor shall the Interstate Commission pledge the credit of any of the member states, except by and with the authority of the member state.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">D.  The Interstate Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements.  The receipts and disbursements of the Interstate Commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws.  However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Interstate Commission shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the Interstate Commission.</p><p class="center">ARTICLE XV.  MEMBER STATES, EFFECTIVE DATE, AND AMENDMENT</p><br /><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">A.  Any state is eligible to become a member state.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">B.  The compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the compact into law by no less than ten (10) of the states.  The effective date shall be no earlier than December 1, 2007.  Thereafter it shall become effective and binding as to any other member state upon enactment of the compact into law by that state.

No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the Interstate Commission and the member states unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the member states.</p><p class="center">ARTICLE XVI.  WITHDRAWAL AND DISSOLUTION</p><br /><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">A.  Withdrawal</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">1.  Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every member state; provided that a member state may withdraw from the compact by specifically repealing the statute which enacted the compact into law.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">2.  Withdrawal from this compact shall be by the enactment of a statute repealing the same, but shall not take effect until one (1) year after the effective date of such statute and until written notice of the withdrawal has been given by the withdrawing state to the governor of each other member jurisdiction.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">3.  The withdrawing state shall immediately notify the chairperson of the Interstate Commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this compact in the withdrawing state.

Reinstatement following withdrawal of a member state shall occur upon the withdrawing state reenacting the compact or upon such later date as determined by the Interstate Commission.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">B.

SEVERABILITY AND CONSTRUCTION</p><br /><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">A.  The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the compact shall be enforceable.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">B.  The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">C.  Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prohibit the applicability of other interstate compacts to which the states are members.</p><p class="center">ARTICLE XVIII.  BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER LAWS</p><br /><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">A.  Other Laws</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">1.
