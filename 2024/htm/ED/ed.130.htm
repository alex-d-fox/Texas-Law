The board shall be authorized to elect any other officers as deemed necessary or advisable. Officers of the board shall be elected at the first regular meeting of the board following the regular election of members of the board in even-numbered years, or at any time thereafter in order to fill a vacancy.

Said board shall act and proceed by and through resolutions or orders adopted or passed by the board and the affirmative vote of a majority of all members of the board shall be required to adopt or pass a resolution or order, and the board shall adopt such rules, regulations, and bylaws as it deems advisable, not inconsistent with this section.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  The basic term of office of a member of the board shall be six years, and one-third of the members of the board shall be elected at large in the district at regular elections to be held on the first Saturday in April in each even-numbered year;  provided that with a seven-member board two members shall be elected in two consecutive even-numbered years and three members shall be elected in the following even-numbered year.

Upon the creation of a new board, or in any other situation where necessary, the members of the board shall choose by lot the terms for which they shall serve, so as to comply with the foregoing provisions.  If a board is increased from seven to nine members, one of the members shall be appointed to serve until the first election at which two members otherwise would have been elected, and the other shall be appointed to serve until the second election at which two members otherwise would have been elected, and three members shall be elected for six-year terms at each election.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  Members of a board shall be elected at large from each junior college district at regular elections to be called and held by the board for such purpose, at the expense of the district, on the first Saturday in April in each even-numbered year.  Said elections shall be held in accordance with the Texas Election Code except as hereinafter provided, and all resident, qualified electors of the district shall be permitted to vote.  Each such election shall be called by resolution or order of the board, and notice of each such election shall be given by publishing an appropriate notice, in a newspaper of general circulation in the district, at least 10 days prior to the date of the election, setting forth the date of the election, the polling place or places, the numbers of the positions to be filled, the candidates for each position and any other matters deemed necessary or advisable.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  The board shall designate a number for the position held by each member of the board, from one upward in consecutive numerical order in such manner that the lowest numbers shall be assigned to the members whose terms of office expire in the shortest length of time, provided that any such position number designations on existing boards under existing law at the effective date of this act shall remain in effect.  At each election candidates shall be voted upon and be elected separately for each position on the board, and the name of each candidate shall be placed on the official ballot according to the number of the position for which he or she is running.  A candidate receiving a majority of the votes cast for all candidates for a position shall be declared elected.  If no candidate receives such a majority, then the two candidates receiving the highest number of votes shall run against each other for the position.  The run-off election for all positions shall be held on a date that complies with law and shall be ordered, notice thereof given, and held, as provided herein for regular elections.  Any resident, qualified elector of the district may have his or her name placed as a candidate on the official ballot for any position to be filled at each regular election by filing with the secretary of the board a written application therefor signed by the applicant, not later than 5 p.m. of the 45th day before the date of the election.  An application may not be filed earlier than the 30th day before the date of the filing deadline.  Such application must state the number of the position for which he or she is a candidate, or the name of the incumbent member of the board holding the position for which he or she desires to run.  The location on the ballot of the names of candidates for each position shall be chosen by lot by the board.  A candidate shall be eligible to run for only one position at each election. </p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  Notwithstanding anything in this code to the contrary, the provisions of all or any part of the laws of this state in effect immediately prior to the effective date of this act and relating to the name of any junior college district or the name of its governing board, or to the number of members of its governing board, or the procedures and times of electing or choosing said members, shall remain in effect under the following conditions.

To the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between any provisions of this section and any provisions of any other law, the provisions of this section shall prevail and control;  provided, however, that any issuer shall have the right to use the provisions of any other laws not in conflict with the provisions hereof to the extent convenient or necessary to carry out any power or authority, express or implied, granted by this section.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  When the governing body of any issuer provides in the resolution or order or other proceedings authorizing the issuance of any bond, any credit agreement, or any other agreement for a pledge or lien on revenues, income, or other resources of the issuer, or the assets of the issuer, or any fund maintained by the issuer to secure payment of the obligations or to secure payments required by a credit agreement or any other agreement, such pledge or lien shall be valid and binding in accordance with its terms without further action on the part of the issuer and without any filing or recording with respect thereto except in the records of the issuer.  All such liens and pledges shall be perfected from the time of payment for and delivery of the obligations and the credit agreement or other agreement until the obligations or other payments, including those under the credit agreement, have been paid or payment of the obligations has been provided for or the terms of the credit agreement or other agreement have been satisfied in accordance with their respective terms and such lien shall be fully perfected as to items then on hand and thereafter received until the satisfaction of such obligations, and said items shall be subject to such liens or pledges without any physical delivery thereof or further act.  Nothing contained in this section shall relieve any issuer of any obligation to file or record any lien on realty or submit any issue of obligations for approval by the attorney general and registration by the comptroller of public accounts.</p>
