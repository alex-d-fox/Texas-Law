The legislature, giving due consideration to the historical and continuing interest of the people of the State of Texas in encouraging deserving and qualified persons to realize their aspirations for education beyond high school finds and declares that postsecondary education for those who desire such an education and are properly qualified therefor is important to the welfare and security of this state and the nation and, consequently, is an important public purpose.  The legislature finds and declares that the state can achieve its full economic and social potential only if every individual has the opportunity to contribute to the full extent of his capabilities and only when financial barriers to his economic, social, and educational goals are removed.  It is, therefore, the policy of the legislature and the purpose of this Chapter to establish financial assistance programs to enable qualified students to receive a postsecondary education.</p>
