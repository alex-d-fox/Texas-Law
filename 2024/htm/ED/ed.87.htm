The fact that this university offers United States Maritime Service Cadet (license-option) students practical and technical instruction in the arts and sciences relating to the foregoing subjects, and the further fact that training in these fields will lead to immediate licensing in the United States Flag Fleet and remunerative employment for those who have finished the prescribed courses, make it necessary that larger fees be charged license-option students who enter the university than are now paid by non-license-option students enrolled in state-supported institutions of higher education.  Therefore, the provisions of Subchapter <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&amp;Value=54.501">E</a>, Chapter <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&amp;Value=54">54</a> of this Code, do not apply to the license-option students enrolled in the university.
