(a)  The purpose of this chapter is to establish in the field of public higher education in the State of Texas an agency to provide leadership and coordination for the Texas higher education system, institutions, and governing boards, to the end that the State of Texas may achieve excellence for college education of its youth through the efficient and effective utilization and concentration of all available resources and the elimination of costly duplication in program offerings, faculties, and physical plants.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  In the exercise of its leadership role, the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board established by this chapter shall be an advocate for the provision of adequate resources and sufficient authority to institutions of higher education so that such institutions may realize, within their prescribed role and scope, their full potential to the benefit of the students who attend such institutions and to the benefit of the citizens of the state in terms of the realization of the benefits of an educated populace.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  Postsecondary education for qualified Texans who desire to pursue such education is important to the welfare and security of this state and the nation and, consequently, is an important public purpose.  The legislature finds and declares that the state can achieve its full economic and social potential only if every individual has the opportunity to contribute to the full extent of the individual's capabilities and only when financial barriers to the individual's economic, social, and educational goals are removed.  In order to facilitate the removal of those barriers, the board, in consultation with one or more nonprofit entities with experience providing the services on a statewide basis, may  provide necessary and desirable services related to financial aid services, including cooperative awareness efforts with appropriate educational and civic associations designed to disseminate postsecondary education awareness information, including information regarding available grant and loan programs and the prevention of student loan default.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board has only the powers expressly provided by law or necessarily implied from an express grant of power.  Any function or power not expressly granted to the board by this code or other law in regard to the administration, organization, control, management, jurisdiction, or governance of an institution of higher education is reserved to and shall be performed by the governing board of the institution, the applicable system administration, or the institution of higher education.</p>

PURPOSE.  It is the policy and purpose of the State of Texas to prevent deception of the public resulting from the conferring and use of fraudulent or substandard college and university degrees;  it is also the purpose of this subchapter to regulate the use of academic terminology in naming or otherwise designating educational institutions, the advertising, solicitation or representation by educational institutions or their agents, and the maintenance and preservation of essential academic records.  Because degrees and equivalent indicators of educational attainment are used by employers in judging the training of prospective employees, by public and private professional groups in determining qualifications for admission to and continuance of practice, and by the general public in assessing the competence of persons engaged in a wide range of activities necessary to the general welfare, regulation by law of the evidences of college and university educational attainment is in the public interest.  To the same end the protection of legitimate institutions and of those holding degrees from them is also in the public interest.</p>
