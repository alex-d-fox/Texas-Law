(a)  A school district, shared services arrangement unit, or regional education service center may contract with a public or private facility, institution, or agency inside or outside of this state for the provision of services to students with disabilities.  Each contract for residential placement must be approved by the commissioner.  The commissioner may approve a residential placement contract only after at least a programmatic evaluation of personnel qualifications, adequacy of physical plant and equipment, and curriculum content.  The commissioner may approve either the whole or a part of a facility or program.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  Except as provided by Subsection (c), costs of an approved contract for residential placement may be paid from a combination of federal, state, and local funds.

English is the basic language of this state.  Public schools are responsible for providing a full opportunity for all students to become competent in speaking, reading, writing, and comprehending the English language.  Large numbers of students in the state come from environments in which the primary language is other than English.  Experience has shown that public school classes in which instruction is given only in English are often inadequate for the education of those students.  The mastery of basic English language skills is a prerequisite for effective participation in the state's educational program.  Bilingual education and special language programs can meet the needs of those students and facilitate their integration into the regular school curriculum.  Therefore, in accordance with the policy of the state to ensure equal educational opportunity to every student, and in recognition of the educational needs of emergent bilingual students, this subchapter provides for the establishment of bilingual education and special language programs in the public schools and provides supplemental financial assistance to help school districts meet the extra costs of the programs.</p>
