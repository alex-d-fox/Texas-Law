Any such Board of Trustees may adopt bylaws regulating the procedure of the Board and fixing the duties of its officers, but the bylaws shall not contain any provision in conflict with the covenants and provisions contained in the resolution authorizing the bonds or the indenture.  In all matters wherein the resolution or indenture are silent as to the powers, duties, obligations and procedure of the Board, the laws and rules governing the port commission shall control the Board of Trustees in so far as applicable.  The Board may be created by the resolution or indenture, and in that event shall have all or any of the powers and authority which could be exercised by the port commission in so far as the management and operation of any such improvement is concerned.

Any such indenture or deed of trust may contain such terms and provisions as the port commission shall deem proper and shall be enforceable in the manner provided by the laws of Texas for the enforcement of other mortgages and encumbrances.

The purchaser or purchasers of such improvements, facilities and properties at any such sale, and the purchaser's successors and assigns, may operate said improvements, facilities and properties as provided in the last above sentence or may at their option remove all or any part or parts of said improvements, facilities and properties for diversion to other purposes.  The provisions of any statute not included in this chapter that relates to the authorization or execution of mortgages and encumbrances or the granting of franchises or leases shall not be applicable to the authorization or execution of any mortgage or encumbrance entered into pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, nor to the granting of any franchise or lease hereunder.  Any obligations issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and additionally secured by an indenture or deed of trust as provided by this subsection, whether such obligations are notes or certificates of indebtedness or otherwise, and the record relating to their issuance, may, at the option of the port commission, be submitted to the Attorney General of Texas for the attorney general's examination and approval, as in the case of bonds, and after the Attorney General has approved the same, such obligations shall be registered by the Comptroller of Public Accounts of Texas; and after such obligations have been approved by the Attorney General and registered by the Comptroller, they shall thereafter be incontestable for any cause except for forgery or fraud.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  The proceeds of the sale of any obligations issued hereunder may be deposited in such bank or banks as may be agreed upon between the purchaser at such sale and the port commission, and may be deposited and paid out pursuant to such terms and conditions as may be so agreed upon, it being expressly provided that the Statutes of Texas pertaining to the deposit of funds in the depository of the authority shall not be applicable to the deposit of the proceeds of such sale.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(l)  The port commission is authorized to enter into an agreement or agreements with the purchaser or purchasers of any obligations issued hereunder under the terms of which the port commission shall agree to keep all of the improvements and facilities, the revenues of which are pledged to the payment of such obligations, insured with insurers of good standing against loss or damage by fire, water or flood, and also from any other hazards customarily insured against by private companies operating similar properties, and to carry with insurers of good standing such insurance covering the use and occupancy of such property as is customarily carried by such private companies.  The cost of such insurance shall be budgeted as maintenance and operation expense and such insurance shall be carried for the benefit of the holders of such obligations.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(m)  The authority, in addition to the other powers hereinabove set out, shall have general power and authority to make and enter into all contracts, leases and agreements necessary or convenient to the carrying out of any of the powers granted in this chapter, which contracts, leases or agreements may be entered into with any person, real or artificial, any corporation, municipal, public or private, and the government or governmental agency, including those of the United States and the State of Texas.
