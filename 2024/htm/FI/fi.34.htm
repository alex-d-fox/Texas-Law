If the depositor defaults in the repayment or satisfaction of the obligation, the bank, without notice to or consent of the depositor, may set off or cancel on its books all or part of the accounts owned by the depositor and apply the value of the accounts in payment of and to the extent of the obligation.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  For purposes of this section, a default occurs when an obligor has failed to make a payment as provided by the terms of the loan or other credit obligation and a grace period provided for by the agreement or law has expired.
