(a)  In addition to any other method otherwise permitted under this title, a creditor and an obligor may agree to compute an annual interest rate on a commercial loan on a 365/360 basis or a 366/360 basis, as applicable, determined by applying the ratio of the percentage annual interest rate agreed to by the parties over a year of 360 days, multiplied by the outstanding principal balance, multiplied by the actual number of days the principal balance is outstanding.  A creditor and an obligor may also agree to compute the term and rate of a commercial loan based on a 360-day year consisting of 12 30-day months.

On and after the date an amount of interest is added to the principal balance under this subsection, that amount no longer constitutes interest, but instead constitutes part of the principal for purposes of calculating the maximum lawful rate or amount of interest on the loan.</p>
