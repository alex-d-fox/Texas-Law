(a)  A "search warrant" is a written order, issued by a magistrate and directed to a peace officer, commanding him to search for any property or thing and to seize the same and bring it before such magistrate or commanding him to search for and photograph a child and to deliver to the magistrate any of the film exposed pursuant to the order.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  No search warrant shall issue for any purpose in this state unless sufficient facts are first presented to satisfy the issuing magistrate that probable cause does in fact exist for its issuance.  A sworn affidavit setting forth substantial facts establishing probable cause shall be filed in every instance in which a search warrant is requested.  Except as otherwise provided by this code, the affidavit becomes public information when the search warrant for which the affidavit was presented is executed, and the magistrate's clerk shall make a copy of the affidavit available for public inspection in the clerk's office during normal business hours.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b-1)(1)  For purposes of this article, a magistrate may consider information communicated by telephone or other reliable electronic means in determining whether to issue a search warrant.  The magistrate may examine an applicant for a search warrant and any person on whose testimony the application is based.  The applicant or other person must be placed under oath before the examination.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  If an applicant for a search warrant attests to the contents of an affidavit submitted by reliable electronic means, the magistrate must acknowledge the attestation in writing on the affidavit.  If the magistrate considers additional testimony or exhibits, the magistrate must:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  ensure that the testimony is recorded verbatim by an electronic recording device, by a court reporter, or in writing;</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  ensure that any recording or reporter's notes are transcribed and that the transcription is certified as accurate and is preserved;</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(C)  sign, certify the accuracy of, and preserve any other written record; and</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(D)  ensure that the exhibits are preserved.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  An applicant for a search warrant who submits information as authorized by this subsection must prepare a proposed duplicate original of the warrant and must read or otherwise transmit its contents verbatim to the magistrate.  A magistrate must enter into an original search warrant the contents of a proposed duplicate original that are read to the magistrate. If the applicant transmits the contents by reliable electronic means, the transmission received by the magistrate may serve as the original search warrant.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  The magistrate may modify a search warrant that is submitted as described by Subdivision (3).  If the magistrate modifies the warrant, the magistrate must:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  transmit the modified version to the applicant by reliable electronic means; or</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  file the modified original and direct the applicant to modify the proposed duplicate original accordingly.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(5)  A magistrate who issues a search warrant for which information is provided by telephone or reliable electronic means must:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  sign the original documents;</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  enter the date and time of issuance on the warrant; and</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(C)  transmit the warrant by reliable electronic means to the applicant or direct the applicant to sign the judge's name and enter the date and time on the duplicate original.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(6)  Evidence obtained pursuant to a search warrant for which information was provided in accordance with this subsection is not subject to suppression on the ground that issuing the warrant in compliance with this subsection was unreasonable under the circumstances, absent a finding of bad faith.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  A search warrant may not be issued under Article <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&amp;Value=18.02">18.02</a>(a)(10) unless the sworn affidavit required by Subsection (b) sets forth sufficient facts to establish probable cause: (1) that a specific offense has been committed, (2) that the specifically described property or items that are to be searched for or seized constitute evidence of that offense or evidence that a particular person committed that offense, and (3) that the property or items constituting evidence to be searched for or seized are located at or on the particular person, place, or thing to be searched.

DISPOSITION OF GAMBLING PARAPHERNALIA, PROHIBITED WEAPON, CRIMINAL INSTRUMENT, AND OTHER CONTRABAND.  (a)  Following the final conviction of a person for possession of a gambling device or equipment, altered gambling equipment, or gambling paraphernalia, for an offense involving a criminal instrument, for an offense involving an obscene device or material, for an offense involving child pornography, or for an offense involving a scanning device or re-encoder, the court entering the judgment of conviction shall order that the machine, device, gambling equipment or gambling paraphernalia, instrument, obscene device or material, child pornography, or scanning device or re-encoder be destroyed or forfeited to the state.  Not later than the 30th day after the final conviction of a person for an offense involving a prohibited weapon, the court entering the judgment of conviction on its own motion, on the motion of the prosecuting attorney in the case, or on the motion of the law enforcement agency initiating the complaint on notice to the prosecuting attorney in the case if the prosecutor fails to move for the order shall order that the prohibited weapon be destroyed or forfeited to the law enforcement agency that initiated the complaint.  If the court fails to enter the order within the time required by this subsection, any magistrate in the county in which the offense occurred may enter the order.  Following the final conviction of a person for an offense involving dog fighting, the court entering the judgment of conviction shall order that any dog-fighting equipment be destroyed or forfeited to the state.  Destruction of dogs, if necessary, must be carried out by a veterinarian licensed in this state or, if one is not available, by trained personnel of a humane society or an animal shelter.  If forfeited, the court shall order the contraband delivered to the state, any political subdivision of the state, or to any state institution or agency.  If gambling proceeds were seized, the court shall order them forfeited to the state and shall transmit them to the grand jury of the county in which they were seized for use in investigating alleged violations of the Penal Code, or to the state, any political subdivision of the state, or to any state institution or agency.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  If there is no prosecution or conviction following seizure, the magistrate to whom the return was made shall notify in writing the person found in possession of the alleged gambling device or equipment, altered gambling equipment or gambling paraphernalia, gambling proceeds, prohibited weapon, obscene device or material, child pornography, scanning device or re-encoder, criminal instrument, or dog-fighting equipment to show cause why the property seized should not be destroyed or the proceeds forfeited.  The magistrate, on the motion of the law enforcement agency seizing a prohibited weapon, shall order the weapon destroyed or forfeited to the law enforcement agency seizing the weapon, unless a person shows cause as to why the prohibited weapon should not be destroyed or forfeited.  A law enforcement agency shall make a motion under this section in a timely manner after the time at which the agency is informed in writing by the attorney representing the state that no prosecution will arise from the seizure.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c) The magistrate shall include in the notice a detailed description of the property seized and the total amount of alleged gambling proceeds;  the name of the person found in possession;  the address where the property or proceeds were seized;  and the date and time of the seizure.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d) The magistrate shall send the notice by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the person found in possession at the address where the property or proceeds were seized.

Failure to timely appear forfeits any interest the person may have in the property or proceeds seized, and no person after failing to timely appear may contest destruction or forfeiture.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  If a person timely appears to show cause why the property or proceeds should not be destroyed or forfeited, the magistrate shall conduct a hearing on the issue and determine the nature of property or proceeds and the person's interest therein.
