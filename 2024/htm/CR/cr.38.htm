An application for a writ of mandamus under this subsection does not toll any period of limitations applicable to a habeas petition under state or federal law.  The defendant is entitled to only one application for a writ of mandamus under this subsection.  At any time after the date an application for a writ of habeas corpus is filed in the defendant's case under Section 4(a), Article <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&amp;Value=11.071">11.071</a>, the defendant may file one additional motion for forensic testing under Chapter <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&amp;Value=64">64</a>.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(m)  A defendant may have another laboratory accredited under Article <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&amp;Value=38.01">38.01</a> perform additional testing of any biological evidence required to be tested under Subsection (i).
