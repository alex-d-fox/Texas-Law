(a)  A challenge for cause is an objection made to a particular juror, alleging some fact which renders the juror incapable or unfit to serve on the jury.  A challenge for cause may be made by either the state or the defense for any one of the following reasons:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">1.  That the juror is not a qualified voter in the state and county under the Constitution and laws of the state; provided, however, the failure to register to vote shall not be a disqualification;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">2.  That the juror has been convicted of misdemeanor theft or a felony;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">3.  That the juror is under indictment or other legal accusation for misdemeanor theft or a felony;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">4.  That the juror is insane;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">5.  That the juror has such defect in the organs of feeling or hearing, or such bodily or mental defect or disease as to render the juror unfit for jury service, or that the juror is legally blind and the court in its discretion is not satisfied that the juror is fit for jury service in that particular case;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">6.  That the juror is a witness in the case;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">7.  That the juror served on the grand jury which found the indictment;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">8.

That the juror has a bias or prejudice in favor of or against the defendant;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">10.  That from hearsay, or otherwise, there is established in the mind of the juror such a conclusion as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant as would influence the juror in finding a verdict.  To ascertain whether this cause of challenge exists, the juror shall first be asked whether, in the juror's opinion, the conclusion so established will influence the juror's verdict.  If the juror answers in the affirmative, the juror shall be discharged without further interrogation by either party or the court.  If the juror answers in the negative, the juror shall be further examined as to how the juror's conclusion was formed, and the extent to which it will affect the juror's action; and, if it appears to have been formed from reading newspaper accounts, communications, statements or reports or mere rumor or hearsay, and if the juror states that the juror feels able, notwithstanding such opinion, to render an impartial verdict upon the law and the evidence, the court, if satisfied that the juror is impartial and will render such verdict, may, in its discretion, admit the juror as competent to serve in such case.  If the court, in its discretion, is not satisfied that the juror is impartial, the juror shall be discharged;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">11.

That the juror has conscientious scruples in regard to the infliction of the punishment of death for crime, in a capital case, where the State is seeking the death penalty;</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">2.

That he has a bias or prejudice against any phase of the law upon which the State is entitled to rely for conviction or punishment.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c) A challenge for cause may be made by the defense for any of the following reasons:</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">1. That he is related within the third degree of consanguinity or affinity, as determined under Chapter <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&amp;Value=573">573</a>, Government Code, to the person injured by the commission of the offense, or to any prosecutor in the case;  and</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">2.
