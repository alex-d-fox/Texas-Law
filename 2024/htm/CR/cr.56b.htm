(a)  The legislature recognizes that many innocent individuals suffer personal injury or death as a result of criminal acts. Crime victims and persons who intervene to prevent criminal acts often suffer disabilities, incur financial burdens, or become dependent on public assistance. The legislature finds that there is a need to compensate crime victims and those who suffer personal injury or death in the prevention of crime or in the apprehension of criminals.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  It is the legislature's intent that the compensation of innocent victims of violent crime encourage greater public cooperation in the successful apprehension and prosecution of criminals.</p>
