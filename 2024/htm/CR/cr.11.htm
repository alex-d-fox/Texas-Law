(a)  After final conviction in any felony case, the writ must be made returnable to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas at Austin, Texas.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  An application for writ of habeas corpus filed after final conviction in a felony case, other than a case in which the death penalty is imposed, must be filed with the clerk of the court in which the conviction being challenged was obtained, and the clerk shall assign the application to that court.  When the application is received by that court, a writ of habeas corpus, returnable to the Court of Criminal Appeals, shall issue by operation of law.  The clerk of that court shall make appropriate notation thereof, assign to the case a file number (ancillary to that of the conviction being challenged), and forward a copy of the application by certified mail, return receipt requested, by electronic mail, or by personal service to the attorney representing the state in that court, who shall answer the application not later than the 30th day after the date the copy of the application is received.

Confinement means confinement for any offense or any collateral consequence resulting from the conviction that is the basis of the instant habeas corpus.  If the convicting court decides that there are no such issues, the clerk shall immediately transmit to the Court of Criminal Appeals a copy of the application , any answers filed, and a certificate reciting the date upon which that finding was made.  Failure of the court to act within the allowed 20 days shall constitute such a finding.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  If the convicting court decides that there are controverted, previously unresolved facts which are material to the legality of the applicant's confinement, it shall enter an order within 20 days of the expiration of the time allowed for the state to reply, designating the issues of fact to be resolved.  To resolve those issues the court may order affidavits, depositions, interrogatories, additional forensic testing, and hearings, as well as using personal recollection. The state shall pay the cost of additional forensic testing ordered under this subsection, except that the applicant shall pay the cost of the testing if the applicant retains counsel for purposes of filing an application under this article.

It shall be the duty of the reporter who is designated to transcribe a hearing held pursuant to this article to prepare a transcript within 15 days of its conclusion.  On completion of the transcript, the reporter shall immediately transmit the transcript to the clerk of the convicting court.  After the convicting court makes findings of fact or approves the findings of the person designated to make them, the clerk of the convicting court shall immediately transmit to the Court of Criminal Appeals, under one cover, the application, any answers filed, any motions filed, transcripts of all depositions and hearings, any affidavits, and any other matters such as official records used by the court in resolving issues of fact.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  For the purposes of Subsection (d), "additional forensic testing" does not include forensic DNA testing as provided for in Chapter <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&amp;Value=64">64</a>.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 4.

The Court of Criminal Appeals may deny relief upon the findings and conclusions of the hearing judge without docketing the cause, or may direct that the cause be docketed and heard as though originally presented to said court or as an appeal.

The mandate of the court shall issue to the court issuing the writ, as in other criminal cases.  After conviction the procedure outlined in this Act shall be exclusive and any other proceeding shall be void and of no force and effect in discharging the prisoner.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 6.
