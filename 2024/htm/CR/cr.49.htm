ORGAN TRANSPLANT DONORS;  NOTICE;  INQUESTS.    (a)  When death occurs to an individual designated a prospective organ donor for transplantation by a licensed physician under circumstances requiring the medical examiner of the county in which death occurred, or the medical examiner's authorized deputy, to hold an inquest, the medical examiner, or a member of his staff will be so notified by the administrative head of the facility in which the transplantation is to be performed.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b) When notified pursuant to Subsection (a) of this Section, the medical examiner or the medical examiner's deputy shall perform an inquest on the deceased prospective organ donor.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 7.

If in the opinion of the medical examiner an autopsy is necessary, or if such is requested by the district attorney or criminal district attorney, or county attorney where there is no district attorney or criminal district attorney, the autopsy shall be immediately performed by the medical examiner or a duly authorized deputy.  In those cases where a complete autopsy is deemed unnecessary by the medical examiner to ascertain the cause of death, the medical examiner may perform a limited autopsy involving the taking of blood samples or any other samples of body fluids, tissues or organs, in order to ascertain the cause of death or whether a crime has been committed.  In the case of a body of a human being whose identity is unknown, the medical examiner may authorize such investigative and laboratory tests and processes as are required to determine its identity as well as the cause of death.  In performing an autopsy the medical examiner or authorized deputy may use the facilities of any city or county hospital within the county or such other facilities as are made available.

Before any dead body can be lawfully cremated, the owner or operator of the crematory shall demand and be furnished with a certificate, signed by the medical examiner of the county in which the death occurred showing that an autopsy was performed on said body or that no autopsy thereon was necessary.  It shall be the duty of the medical examiner to determine whether or not, from all the circumstances surrounding the death, an autopsy is necessary prior to issuing a certificate under the provisions of this section.  No autopsy shall be required by the medical examiner as a prerequisite to cremation in case death is caused by the pestilential diseases of Asiatic cholera, bubonic plague, typhus fever, or smallpox.  All certificates furnished to the owner or operator of a crematory by any medical examiner, under the terms of this Article, shall be preserved by such owner or operator of such crematory for a period of two years from the date of the cremation of said body.  A medical examiner is not required to perform an autopsy on the body of a deceased person whose death was caused by a communicable disease during a public health disaster.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 10a. WAITING PERIOD BETWEEN DEATH AND CREMATION.  The body of a deceased person shall not be cremated within 48 hours after the time of death as indicated on the regular death certificate, unless the death certificate indicates death was caused by the pestilential diseases of Asiatic cholera, bubonic plague, typhus fever, or smallpox, or unless the time requirement is waived in writing by the county medical examiner or, in counties not having a county medical examiner, a justice of the peace.  In a public health disaster, the commissioner of public health may designate other communicable diseases for which cremation within 48 hours of the time of death is authorized.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 10b. DISPOSAL OF UNIDENTIFIED BODY.  If the body of a deceased person is unidentified, a person may not cremate or direct the cremation of the body under this article.  If the body is buried, the investigating agency responsible for the burial shall record and maintain for not less than 10 years all information pertaining to the body and the location of burial.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 11.

Copies of all records shall promptly be delivered to the proper district, county, or criminal district attorney in any case where further investigation is advisable.  The records may not be withheld, subject to a discretionary exception under Chapter <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&amp;Value=552">552</a>, Government Code, except that a photograph or x-ray of a body taken during an autopsy is excepted from required public disclosure in accordance with Chapter <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&amp;Value=552">552</a>, Government Code, but is subject to disclosure:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  under a subpoena or authority of other law; or</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  if the photograph or x-ray is of the body of a person who died while in the custody of law enforcement.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  Under the exception to public disclosure provided by Subsection (a), a governmental body as defined by Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&amp;Value=552.003">552.003</a>, Government Code, may withhold a photograph or x-ray described by Subsection (a) without requesting a decision from the attorney general under Subchapter <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&amp;Value=552.301">G</a>, Chapter <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&amp;Value=552">552</a>, Government Code.  This subsection does not affect the required disclosure of a photograph or x-ray under Subsection (a)(1) or (2).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  The medical examiner may release a copy of an autopsy report of a deceased person to any organ and tissue procurement organization, hospital, or other covered entity as defined by Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&amp;Value=181.001">181.001</a>, Health and Safety Code, that treated the deceased person before death or procured any anatomical gift from the body of the deceased person.  The release of a report under this subsection is not considered a disclosure under Chapter <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&amp;Value=552">552</a>, Government Code.  A report obtained under this subsection is confidential and not subject to disclosure under Chapter <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&amp;Value=552">552</a>, Government Code.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 12. TRANSFER OF DUTIES OF JUSTICE OF PEACE.  When the commissioners court of any county shall establish the office of medical examiner, all powers and duties of justices of the peace in such county relating to the investigation of deaths and inquests shall vest in the office of the medical examiner.  Any subsequent General Law pertaining to the duties of justices of the peace in death investigations and inquests shall apply to the medical examiner in such counties as to the extent not inconsistent with this Article, and all laws or parts of laws otherwise in conflict herewith are hereby declared to be inapplicable to this Article.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 13. USE OF FORENSIC ANTHROPOLOGIST.
