(a)  All parties must comply with the rules of pleading as required in civil suits.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b) All cases under this chapter shall proceed to trial in the same manner as in other civil cases.  The state has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that property is subject to forfeiture.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c) It is an affirmative defense to forfeiture under this chapter of property belonging to the spouse of a person whose acts gave rise to the seizure of community property that, because of an act of family violence, as defined by Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&amp;Value=71.004">71.004</a>, Family Code, the spouse was unable to prevent the act giving rise to the seizure.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d) A final conviction for an underlying offense is not a requirement for forfeiture under this chapter.  An owner or interest holder may present evidence of a dismissal or acquittal of an underlying offense in a forfeiture proceeding, and evidence of an acquittal raises a presumption that the property or interest that is the subject of the hearing is nonforfeitable.  This presumption can be rebutted by evidence that the owner or interest holder knew or should have known that the property was contraband.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e) It is the intention of the legislature that asset forfeiture is remedial in nature and not a form of punishment.  If the court finds that all or any part of the property is subject to forfeiture, the judge shall forfeit the property to the state, with the attorney representing the state as the agent for the state, except that if the court finds that the nonforfeitable interest of an interest holder in the property is valued in an amount greater than or substantially equal to the present value of the property, the court shall order the property released to the interest holder.  If the court finds that the nonforfeitable interest of an interest holder is valued in an amount substantially less than the present value of the property and that the property is subject to forfeiture, the court shall order the property forfeited to the state with the attorney representing the state acting as the agent of the state, and making necessary orders to protect the nonforfeitable interest of the interest holder.  On final judgment of forfeiture, the attorney representing the state shall dispose of the property in the manner required by Article <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&amp;Value=59.06">59.06</a> of this code.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f) On forfeiture to the state of an amount greater than $2,500, the clerk of the court in which the forfeiture proceeding was held is entitled to court costs in that proceeding as in other civil proceedings unless the forfeiture violates federal requirements for multijurisdictional task force cases authorized under Chapter <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&amp;Value=362">362</a>, Local Government Code.  The procedure for collecting the costs is the procedure established under Subsections (a) and (c), Article <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&amp;Value=59.06">59.06</a>.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g) If property is seized at a federal checkpoint, the notice of seizure and intended forfeiture may be filed in and the proceeding may be held in:</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(1) the county in which the seizure occurred;  or</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(2) with the consent of the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the property, a county that is adjacent to the county in which the seizure occurred, if both counties are in the same judicial district.</p>
