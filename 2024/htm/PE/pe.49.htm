The court shall require the defendant to obtain the device at the defendant's own cost on or before that ending date, require the defendant to provide evidence to the court on or before that ending date that the device has been installed on each appropriate vehicle, and order the device to remain installed on each vehicle until the first anniversary of that ending date.  If the court determines the offender is unable to pay for the device, the court may impose a reasonable payment schedule not to extend beyond the first anniversary of the date of installation.  The Department of Public Safety shall approve devices for use under this subsection.  Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&amp;Value=521.247">521.247</a>, Transportation Code, applies to the approval of a device under this subsection and the consequences of that approval.  Failure to comply with an order entered under this subsection is punishable by contempt.  For the purpose of enforcing this subsection, the court that enters an order under this subsection retains jurisdiction over the defendant until the date on which the device is no longer required to remain installed.
