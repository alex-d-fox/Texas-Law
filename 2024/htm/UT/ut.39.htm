GENERAL PROVISIONS</p><br /><p class="left"><a name="39.001"></a><a name="72654.62497"></a></p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 39.001.  LEGISLATIVE POLICY AND PURPOSE.  (a)  The legislature finds that the production and sale of electricity is not a monopoly warranting regulation of rates, operations, and services and that the public interest in competitive electric markets requires that, except for transmission and distribution services and for the recovery of stranded costs, electric services and their prices should be determined by customer choices and the normal forces of competition.  As a result, this chapter is enacted to protect the public interest during the transition to and in the establishment of a fully competitive electric power industry.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  The legislature finds that it is in the public interest to:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  implement on January 1, 2002, a competitive retail electric market that allows each retail customer to choose the customer's provider of electricity and that encourages full and fair competition among all providers of electricity;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  allow utilities with uneconomic generation-related assets and purchased power contracts to recover the reasonable excess costs over market of those assets and purchased power contracts;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  educate utility customers about anticipated changes in the provision of retail electric service to ensure that the benefits of the competitive market reach all customers;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  protect the competitive process in a manner that ensures the confidentiality of competitively sensitive information during the transition to a competitive market and after the commencement of customer choice.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  Regulatory authorities, excluding the governing body of a municipally owned electric utility that has not opted for customer choice or the body vested with power to manage and operate a municipally owned electric utility that has not opted for customer choice, may not make rules or issue orders regulating competitive electric services, prices, or competitors or restricting or conditioning competition except as authorized in this title and may not discriminate against any participant or type of participant during the transition to a competitive market and in the competitive market.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  Regulatory authorities, excluding the governing body of a municipally owned electric utility that has not opted for customer choice or the body vested with power to manage and operate a municipally owned electric utility that has not opted for customer choice, shall authorize or order competitive rather than regulatory methods to achieve the goals of this chapter to the greatest extent feasible and shall adopt rules and issue orders that are both practical and limited so as to impose the least impact on competition.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  Judicial review of competition rules adopted by the commission shall be conducted under Chapter <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&amp;Value=2001">2001</a>, Government Code, except as otherwise provided by this chapter.  Judicial review of the validity of competition rules shall be commenced in the Court of Appeals for the Fifteenth Court of Appeals District and shall be limited to the commission's rulemaking record.  The rulemaking record consists of:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the notice of the proposed rule;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  the comments of all interested persons;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  all studies, reports, memoranda, or other materials on which the commission relied in adopting the rule; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  the order adopting the rule.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  A person who challenges the validity of a competition rule must file a notice of appeal with the court of appeals and serve the notice on the commission not later than the 15th day after the date on which the rule as adopted is published in the Texas Register.  The notice of appeal shall designate the person challenging the rule as the appellant and the commission as the appellee.  The commission shall prepare the rulemaking record and file it with the court of appeals not later than the 30th day after the date the notice of appeal is served on the commission.  The court of appeals shall hear and determine each appeal as expeditiously as possible with lawful precedence over other matters.  The appellant, and any person who is permitted by the court to intervene in support of the appellant's claims, shall file and serve briefs not later than the 30th day after the date the commission files the rulemaking record.  The commission, and any person who is permitted by the court to intervene in support of the rule, shall file and serve briefs not later than the 60th day after the date the appellant files the appellant's brief.  The court of appeals may, on its own motion or on motion of any person for good cause, modify the filing deadlines prescribed by this subsection.  The court of appeals shall render judgment affirming the rule or reversing and, if appropriate on reversal, remanding the rule to the commission for further proceedings, consistent with the court's opinion and judgment.  The Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure apply to an appeal brought under this section to the extent not inconsistent with this section.</p>

For purposes of this subchapter, market power abuses are practices by persons possessing market power that are unreasonably discriminatory or tend to unreasonably restrict, impair, or reduce the level of competition, including practices that tie unregulated products or services to regulated products or services or unreasonably discriminate in the provision of regulated services.  For purposes of this section, "market power abuses" include predatory pricing, withholding of production, precluding entry, and collusion.

Within 180 days after the effective date of this section, the commission by rule shall establish the acceptable forms of financial assurance, which shall include, but not be limited to, parent guarantees and support agreements, letters of credit, surety or insurance, and such other requirements necessary to ensure compliance with this section.  In establishing the acceptable forms of assurance, and the eligibility requirements for each form of assurance, the commission shall consider the relative risk factors and creditworthiness attributes of potential applicant financial characteristics in order to minimize exposure of retail electric customers to default by power generation companies under this section.  The power generation company may choose the manner of financial assurance for which it is eligible under the commission's rules.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(m)  In the event the financial assurances provided by Subsection (k) are insufficient to meet the annual funding requirements of the decommissioning trust, the retail electric customers shall be responsible for funding any shortfall in the cost of decommissioning the nuclear generating unit.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(n)  The commission shall determine the manner in which any shortfall in the cost of decommissioning a nuclear generating unit shall be recovered from retail electric customers in the state, consistent with law.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(o)  For retail electric customers of a municipally owned utility or an electric cooperative that has an agreement to purchase power from a nuclear generating unit, the amount of the shortfall in the cost of decommissioning the nuclear generating unit that the customers are responsible for is limited to a portion of that shortfall that bears the same proportion to the total shortfall as the amount of electric power generated by the nuclear generating unit and purchased by the municipally owned utility or electric cooperative bears to the total amount of power the nuclear generating unit generated.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(p)  If retail electric customers in this state become responsible for the costs of decommissioning a nuclear generating unit and incur costs under this section and the nuclear generating unit is operational, as a condition of operating the generating unit, the power generation company or any new owner shall repay the costs the electric customers incurred in the manner determined by the commission.  The commission may authorize the repayment to occur over a period established by the commission.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(q)  The commission shall, in conjunction with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, investigate the development of a mechanism whereby the State of Texas could ensure that funds for decommissioning will be obtained when necessary in the same manner as if the State of Texas were the licensee under federal law. </p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(r)  The commission by rule shall ensure that:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  money for decommissioning a nuclear generating unit is prudently collected, managed, and spent for its intended purposes; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  decommissioning money that remains unspent after decommissioning of the nuclear generating unit is complete is returned to the power generation company and the retail electric customers based on the proportionate amount of money the power generation company and retail electric customers paid into the fund.</p>

(a)  An electric utility is allowed to recover all of its net, verifiable, nonmitigable stranded costs incurred in purchasing power and providing electric generation service.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)(1) Recovery of retail stranded costs by an electric utility shall be from all existing or future retail customers, including the facilities, premises, and loads of those retail customers, within the utility's geographical certificated service area as it existed on May 1, 1999.  A retail customer may not avoid stranded cost recovery charges by switching to new on-site generation except as provided by Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=39.262">39.262</a>(k).  For purposes of this subchapter, "new on-site generation" means electric generation capacity greater than 10 megawatts capable of being lawfully delivered to the site without use of utility distribution or transmission facilities and which was not, on or before December 31, 1999, either:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  a fully operational facility;  or</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  a project supported by substantially complete filings for all necessary site-specific environmental permits under the rules of the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission in effect at the time of filing.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  If a customer commences taking energy from new on-site generation which materially reduces the customer's use of energy delivered through the utility's facilities, the customer shall pay an amount each month computed by multiplying the output of the on-site generation by the new sum of competition transition charges under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=39.201">39.201</a> and transition charges under Subchapter G which are in effect during that month.  Payment shall be made to the utility, its successors, an assignee, or other collection agent responsible for collecting the competition transition charges and transition charges and shall be collected in addition to the competition transition charges and transition charges applicable to energy actually delivered to the customer through the utility's facilities.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  In multiply certificated areas, a retail customer may not avoid stranded cost recovery charges by switching to another electric utility, electric cooperative, or municipally owned utility after May 1, 1999.  A customer in a multiply certificated service area that requested to switch providers on or before May 1, 1999, or was not taking service from an electric utility on May 1, 1999, and does not do so after that date is not responsible for paying retail stranded costs of that utility.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  An electric utility shall pursue commercially reasonable means to reduce its potential stranded costs, including good faith attempts to renegotiate above-cost fuel and purchased power contracts or the exercise of normal business practices to protect the value of its assets.  The commission shall consider the utility's efforts under this subsection when determining the amount of the utility's stranded costs;  provided, however, that nothing in this section authorizes the commission to substitute its judgment for a market valuation of generation assets determined under Sections <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=39.262">39.262</a>(h) and (i).</p>

(a)  An electric utility, together with its affiliated retail electric provider and its affiliated transmission and distribution utility, may not be permitted to overrecover stranded costs through the procedures established by this section or through the application of the measures provided by the other sections of this chapter.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  After the freeze period, an electric utility located in a power region that is not certified under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=39.152">39.152</a> shall continue to file annual reports under Sections <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=39.257">39.257</a>, <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=39.258">39.258</a>, and <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=39.259">39.259</a> as if the freeze period remained in effect, until the time the power region qualifies as certified under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=39.152">39.152</a>.  In addition, the commission staff and the office shall continue to review the annual reports as provided by Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=39.261">39.261</a>.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  After January 10, 2004, at a schedule and under procedures to be determined by the commission, each transmission and distribution utility, its affiliated retail electric provider, and its affiliated power generation company shall jointly file to finalize stranded costs under Subsections (h) and (i) and reconcile those costs with the estimated stranded costs used to develop the competition transition charge in the proceeding held under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=39.201">39.201</a>.  Any resulting difference shall be applied to the nonbypassable delivery rates of the transmission and distribution utility, except that at the utility's option, any or all of the amounts recovered under this section may be securitized under Subchapter G.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  The affiliated power generation company shall reconcile, and either credit or bill to the transmission and distribution utility, the net sum of:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the former electric utility's final fuel balance determined under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=39.202">39.202</a>(c);  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  any difference between the price of power obtained through the capacity auctions under Sections <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=39.153">39.153</a> and <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=39.156">39.156</a> and the power cost projections that were employed for the same time period in the ECOM model to estimate stranded costs in the proceeding under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=39.201">39.201</a>.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  To the extent that the price to beat exceeded the market price of electricity, the affiliated retail electric provider shall reconcile and credit to the affiliated transmission and distribution utility any positive difference between the price to beat established under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=39.202">39.202</a>, reduced by the nonbypassable delivery charge established under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=39.201">39.201</a>, and the prevailing market price of electricity during the same time period.  A reconciliation for the applicable customer class is not required under this subsection for an affiliated retail electric provider that satisfies the requirements of Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=39.202">39.202</a>(e)(1) or (2) before the expiration of two years from the introduction of customer choice.  If a reconciliation is required, in no event shall the amount credited exceed an amount equal to the number of residential or small commercial customers served by the affiliated transmission and distribution utility that are buying electricity from the affiliated retail electric provider at the price to beat on the second anniversary of the beginning of competition, minus the number of new customers obtained outside the service area, multiplied by $150.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  To the extent that any amount of regulatory assets included in a transition charge or competition transition charge exceeds the amount of regulatory assets approved in a rate order which became effective on or before September 1, 1999, the commission shall conduct a review during the true-up proceeding to determine whether such amounts were appropriately calculated and constituted reasonable and necessary costs pursuant to Subchapter <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=36.051">B</a>, Chapter <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=36">36</a>.

If the commission determines that the nonbypassable delivery rates are not sufficient, the commission may extend the original collection period for the charge or, if necessary, increase the charge.  Alternatively, if the commission determines that the nonbypassable delivery rates are larger than are needed to recover the transmission and distribution utility's costs, the commission shall correspondingly reduce:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the competition transition charge, to the extent it has not been securitized;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  the depreciation expense that has been redirected under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=39.256">39.256</a>;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  the transmission and distribution utility's rates;  or</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  a combination of the elements in Subdivisions (1)-(3).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  Except as provided in Subsection (i), for the purpose of finalizing the stranded cost estimate used to establish the competition transition charge under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=39.201">39.201</a>, the affiliated power generation company shall quantify its stranded costs using one or more of the following methods:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  Sale of Assets.  If, at any time after December 31, 1999, an electric utility or its affiliated power generation company has sold some or all of its generation assets, which sale shall include all generating assets associated with each generating plant that is sold, in a bona fide third-party transaction under a competitive offering, the total net value realized from the sale establishes the market value of the generation assets sold.  If not all assets are sold, the market value of the remaining generation assets shall be established by one or more of the other methods in this section.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  Stock Valuation Method.  If, at any time after December 31, 1999, an electric utility or its affiliated power generation company has transferred some or all of its generation assets, including, at the election of the electric utility or power generation company, any fuel and fuel transportation contracts related to those assets, to one or more separate affiliated or nonaffiliated corporations, not less than 51 percent of the common stock of each corporation is spun off and sold to public investors through a national stock exchange, and the common stock has been traded for not less than one year, the resulting average daily closing price of the common stock over 30 consecutive trading days chosen by the commission out of the last 120 consecutive trading days before the filing required under Subsection (c) establishes the market value of the common stock equity in each transferee corporation.  The book value of each transferee corporation's debt and preferred stock securities shall be added to the market value of its assets.  The market value of each transferee corporation's assets shall be reduced by the corresponding net book value of the assets acquired by each transferee corporation from any entity other than the affiliated electric utility or power generation company.  The resulting market value of the assets establishes the market value of the generation assets transferred by the electric utility or power generation company to each separate corporation.  If not all assets are disposed of in this manner, the market value of the remaining assets shall be established by one or more of the other methods in this section.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  Partial Stock Valuation Method.  If, at any time after December 31, 1999, an electric utility or its affiliated power generation company has transferred some or all of its generation assets, including, at the election of the electric utility or power generation company, any fuel and fuel transportation contracts related to those assets, to one or more separate affiliated or nonaffiliated corporations, at least 19 percent, but less than 51 percent, of the common stock of each corporation is spun off and sold to public investors through a national stock exchange, and the common stock has been traded for not less than one year, the resulting average daily closing price of the common stock over 30 consecutive trading days chosen by the commission out of the last 120 consecutive trading days before the filing required under Subsection (c) shall be presumed to establish the market value of the common stock equity in each transferee corporation.  The commission may accept the market valuation to conclusively establish the value of the common stock equity in each transferee corporation or convene a valuation panel of three independent financial experts to determine whether the percentage of common stock sold is fairly representative of the total common stock equity or whether a control premium exists for the retained interest.  The valuation panel must consist of financial experts, chosen from proposals submitted in response to commission requests, from the top 10 nationally recognized investment banks with demonstrated experience in the United States electric industry as indicated by the dollar amount of public offerings of long-term debt and equity of United States investor-owned electric companies over the immediately preceding three years as ranked by the publications "Securities Data" or "Institutional Investor."  If the panel determines that a control premium exists for the retained interest, the panel shall determine the amount of the control premium, and the commission shall adopt the determination but may not increase the market value by a control premium greater than 10 percent.  The costs and expenses of the panel, as approved by the commission, shall be paid by each transferee corporation.  The determination of the commission based on the finding of the panel conclusively establishes the value of the common stock of each transferee corporation.  The book value of each transferee corporation's debt and preferred stock securities shall be added to the market value of its assets.  The market value of each transferee corporation's assets shall be reduced by the corresponding net book value of the assets acquired by each transferee corporation from any entity other than the affiliated electric utility or power generation company.  The resulting market value of the assets establishes the market value of the generation assets transferred by the electric utility or power generation company to each separate corporation.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  Exchange of Assets.  If, at any time after December 31, 1999, an electric utility or its affiliated power generation company has transferred some or all of its generation assets, including any fuel and fuel transportation contracts related to those assets, in a bona fide third-party exchange transaction, the stranded costs related to the transferred assets shall be the difference between the book value and the market value of the transferred assets at the time of the exchange, taking into account any other consideration received or given.  The market value of the transferred assets may be determined through an appraisal by a nationally recognized independent appraisal firm, if the market value is subject to a market valuation by means of an offer of sale in accordance with this subdivision.  To obtain a market valuation by means of an offer of sale, the owner of the asset shall offer it for sale to other parties under procedures that provide broad public notice of the offer and a reasonable opportunity for other parties to bid on the asset.  The owner of the asset may establish a reserve price for any offer based on the sum of the appraised value of the asset and the tax impact of selling the asset, as determined by the commission.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  Unless an electric utility or its affiliated power generation company combines all of its remaining generation assets into one or more transferee corporations as described in Subsections (h)(2) and (3), the electric utility shall quantify its stranded costs for nuclear assets using the ECOM method.  The ECOM method is the estimation model prepared for and described by the commission's April 1998 Report to the Texas Senate Interim Committee on Electric Restructuring entitled "Potentially Strandable Investment (ECOM) Report:  1998 Update."  The methodology used in the model must be the same as that used in the 1998 report to determine the "base case."  At the time of the proceeding under this section, the ECOM model shall be rerun using updated company-specific inputs required by the model, updating the market price of electricity, and using updated natural gas price forecasts and the capacity cost based on the long-run marginal cost of the most economic new generation technology then available.  Natural gas price projections used in the model must be market-based natural gas forward prices, where available.  Growth rates in generating plant operations and maintenance costs and allocated administrative and general costs shall be benchmarked by comparing those costs to the best available information on cost trends for comparable generating plants.  Capital additions shall be benchmarked using the limitation in Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=39.259">39.259</a>(b).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  The commission shall issue a final order not later than the 150th day after the date of the filing under this section by the transmission and distribution utility, its affiliated retail electric provider, and its affiliated power generation company, and the resulting order shall be subject to judicial review under Chapter <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&amp;Value=2001">2001</a>, Government Code.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  Notwithstanding Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=39.252">39.252</a>, to the extent that a customer's actual load has been lawfully served by a fully operational qualifying facility before September 1, 2001, or by an on-site power production facility with a rated capacity of 10 megawatts or less, any charge for recovery of stranded costs under this section or Subchapter G assessed on that customer after the facility becomes fully operational shall be included only in those tariffs or charges associated with the services actually provided by the transmission and distribution utility, if any, to the customer after the facility became fully operational and may not include any costs associated with the service provided to the customer by the electric utility or its affiliated transmission and distribution utility under their tariffs before the operation of that qualifying facility.  To qualify under this subsection, a qualifying facility must have made substantially complete filings on or before December 31, 1999, for all necessary site-specific environmental permits under the rules of the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission in effect at the time of filing.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(l)  To protect retail customers in this state, and ensure the appropriateness of the nonbypassable rates of electric utilities and transmission and distribution utilities, notwithstanding any other provision of this title, an electric utility or transmission and distribution utility must report to and obtain approval of the commission before closing any transaction in which:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the electric utility or transmission and distribution utility will be merged or consolidated with another electric utility or transmission and distribution utility;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  at least 50 percent of the stock of the electric utility or transmission and distribution utility will be transferred or sold; or</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  a controlling interest or operational control of the electric utility or transmission and distribution utility will be transferred.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(m)  The commission shall approve a transaction under Subsection (l) if the commission finds that the transaction is in the public interest.  In making its determination, the commission shall consider whether the transaction will adversely affect the reliability of service, availability of service, or cost of service of the electric utility or transmission and distribution utility.  The commission shall make the determination concerning a transaction under this subsection not later than the 180th day after the date the commission receives the relevant report.  The commission may extend the deadline provided by this subsection for not more than 60 days if the commission determines the extension is needed to evaluate additional information, to consider actions taken by other jurisdictions concerning the transaction, to provide for administrative efficiency, or for other good cause.  If the commission has not made a determination before the expiration of the deadline provided by or extended under this subsection, the transaction is considered approved.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(n)  Subsections (l) and (m) do not apply to a transaction described by Subsection (l) for which a definitive agreement was executed before April 1, 2007, if an electric utility or transmission and distribution utility or a person seeking to acquire or merge with an electric utility or transmission and distribution utility made a filing for review of the transaction under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=14.101">14.101</a> before May 1, 2007, and the resulting proceeding was not withdrawn.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(o)  If an electric utility or transmission and distribution utility or a person seeking to acquire or merge with an electric utility or transmission and distribution utility files with the commission a stipulation, representation, or commitment in advance of or as part of a filing under Subsection (l) or under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=14.101">14.101</a>, the commission may enforce the stipulation, representation, or commitment to the extent that the stipulation, representation, or commitment is consistent with the standards provided by this section and Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=14.101">14.101</a>.

The purpose of this subchapter is to enable utilities to use securitization financing to recover regulatory assets, all other amounts determined under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=39.262">39.262</a>, and any amounts being recovered under a competition transition charge determined as a result of the proceedings under Sections <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=39.201">39.201</a> and <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=39.262">39.262</a>. This type of debt will lower the carrying costs of the assets relative to the costs that would be incurred using conventional utility financing methods.  The proceeds of the transition bonds shall be used solely for the purposes of reducing the amount of recoverable regulatory assets and other amounts, as determined by the commission in accordance with this chapter, through the refinancing or retirement of utility debt or equity.  The commission shall ensure that securitization provides tangible and quantifiable benefits to ratepayers, greater than would have been achieved absent the issuance of transition bonds.  The commission shall ensure that the structuring and pricing of the transition bonds result in the lowest transition bond charges consistent with market conditions and the terms of the financing order.  The amount securitized may not exceed the present value of the revenue requirement over the life of the proposed transition bond associated with the regulatory assets or other amounts sought to be securitized.  The present value calculation shall use a discount rate equal to the proposed interest rate on the transition bonds.</p>

If the timing of a utility's receipt of those amounts prevents their inclusion as a reduction to the hurricane reconstruction costs that are securitized, the commission shall take those amounts into account in:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the utility's next base rate proceeding; or</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  any proceeding in which the commission considers hurricane reconstruction costs.</p>

The reduced rate for a retail electric provider shall result in a total charge that is at least 10 percent and, if sufficient money in the system benefit fund is available, up to 20 percent, lower than the amount the customer would otherwise be charged.  To the extent the system benefit fund is insufficient to fund the initial 10 percent rate reduction, the commission may increase the fee to an amount not more than 65 cents per megawatt hour, as provided by Subsection (b).  If the fee is set at 65 cents per megawatt hour or if the commission determines that appropriations are insufficient to fund the 10 percent rate reduction, the commission may reduce the rate reduction to less than 10 percent.  For a municipally owned utility or electric cooperative, the reduced rate shall be equal to an amount that can be fully funded by that portion of the nonbypassable fee proceeds paid by the municipally owned utility or electric cooperative that is allocated to the utility or cooperative by the commission under Subsection (e) for programs for low-income customers of the utility or cooperative.  The reduced rate for municipally owned utilities and electric cooperatives under this section is in addition to any rate reduction that may result from local programs for low-income customers of the municipally owned utilities or electric cooperatives.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  A retail electric provider, municipally owned utility, or electric cooperative seeking reimbursement from the system benefit fund may not charge an eligible low-income customer a rate higher than the appropriate rate determined under Subsection (h).

The commission shall adopt rules providing for the reimbursement.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  The commission shall adopt rules providing for methods of enrolling customers eligible to receive reduced rates under Subsection (h).  The rules must provide for automatic enrollment as one enrollment option.  The Texas Department of Human Services, on request of the commission, shall assist in the adoption and implementation of these rules.  The commission and the Texas Department of Human Services shall enter into a memorandum of understanding establishing the respective duties of the commission and the department in relation to the automatic enrollment.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j-1)  The commission shall adopt rules governing the bill payment assistance program provided under Subsection (e)(1)(B).
