This section may not apply to rates for:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  sales of electric energy by an electric cooperative that has adopted customer choice;  or</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  wholesale sales of electric energy.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  An electric cooperative may change its rates by:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  adopting a resolution approving the proposed change;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  mailing notice of the proposed change to each affected customer whose rate would be increased by the proposed change at least 30 days before implementation of the proposed change, which notice may be included in a monthly billing;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  holding a meeting to discuss the proposed rate changes with affected customers, if any change is expected to increase total system annual revenues by more than $100,000 or one percent, whichever is greater.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  An electric cooperative may implement the proposed rates on completion of the requirements under Subsection (b), and those rates shall remain in effect until changed by the electric cooperative as provided by this section or, for rates other than retail delivery rates, until this section is no longer applicable because the electric cooperative adopts customer choice.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  The electric cooperative may reconsider a rate change at any time and adjust the rate by board resolution without additional notice or meeting of customers if the rate as adjusted is not expected to increase the revenues from a customer class.  However, if notice is given to a customer class that would receive an increase as a result of the adjustment, then the rates for the customer class may be increased without additional meeting of the customers.

In the event of such enforcement proceeding or judicial review the court may, in addition to the other remedies provided for in this section, award reasonable costs, including reasonable attorney's fees, to the party prevailing on the case as a whole.  Additionally, if the court finds that either party has acted in bad faith solely for the purpose of perpetuating the rate dispute between the parties, the court may impose sanctions on the offending party in accordance with the provisions of Subsections (b), (c), and (e), Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&amp;Value=10.004">10.004</a>, Civil Practice and Remedies Code.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  An electric cooperative that has not adopted customer choice and that has not changed each of its nonresidential rates since January 1, 1999, shall, on or before May 1, 2002, adopt a resolution setting rates.

In the event the electric cooperative fails to adopt a resolution setting rates pursuant to this subsection, a customer may petition for judicial review of the electric cooperative's rates.  A person initiates judicial review by filing a petition in the district court of Travis County not later than November 1, 2002.</p>

Each board that chooses to securitize under this subchapter shall ensure that the structuring and pricing of the securitized bonds are consistent with market conditions and the terms of the financing order.

The transaction shall be treated as an absolute sale regardless of whether the purchaser has any recourse against the seller, or any other term of the parties' agreement, including the seller's retention of an equity interest in the securitized property, the fact that the electric cooperative acts as the collector of securitized charges relating to the securitized property, or the treatment of the transfer as a financing for tax, financial reporting, or other purposes.</p>

The transfer, sale, or assignment, or the creation, granting, perfection, and enforcement of liens and security interests in securitized property are governed by this section and not by the Business &amp; Commerce Code.  Securitized property shall constitute property for all purposes, including for contracts securing securitized bonds, regardless of whether the securitized property revenues and proceeds have accrued.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  A valid and enforceable transfer, sale, or assignment, or lien and security interest, as applicable, in securitized property may be created only by a financing order and the execution and delivery of a transfer, sale, or assignment, or security agreement, as applicable, with a financing party in connection with the issuance of securitized bonds.

The securitized property shall be immediately subject to the lien, and the lien shall immediately attach to the securitized property and be effective, binding, and enforceable against the electric cooperative, its creditors, their successors, assignees, and all others asserting rights therein, regardless of whether those persons have notice of the lien and without the need for any physical delivery, recordation, filing, or further act.
