The utility has the burden of proof to establish that the costs of the contract are reasonable and necessary.  The regulatory authority may authorize a transmission and distribution utility to include a reasonable return on the payments required under the contract only if the contract terms satisfy the relevant accounting standards for a capital lease or finance lease.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  The total amount of electric energy storage capacity reserved by contracts under Subsection (a) may not exceed 100 megawatts.  The commission shall by rule establish the maximum amount of electric energy storage capacity allotted to each transmission and distribution utility.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  The commission shall adopt rules as necessary to implement this section and establish criteria for approving contracts under Subsection (a).</p>
