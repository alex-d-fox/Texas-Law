The nonbypassable charge shall be as determined by the member city's governing body and may be spread over 16 years.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  The stranded costs that may be recovered under this section are those costs that were determined by the commission and stated in the commission's April 1998 Report to the Texas Senate Interim Committee on Electric Utility Restructuring entitled "Potentially Strandable Investment (ECOM) Report:  1998 Update" and specifically stated in the report at Appendix A (ECOM Estimates Including the Effects of Transition Plans) under the commission base case benchmark base market price for the year 2002.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  The stranded cost amounts described in this section may not be included in the generation costs used in setting rates by the member city's governing body.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  The provisions of this section are cumulative of all other provisions of this chapter, and nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or restrict the application of any provision of this chapter to the member cities.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  The municipal power agency shall extinguish the agency's indebtedness by sale of the electric facility to one or more purchasers, by way of a sale through the issuance of taxable or tax-exempt debt to the member cities, or by any other method.  The agency shall set as an objective the extinguishment of the agency's debt by September 1, 2000.  In the event this objective is not met, the agency shall provide detailed reasons to the electric utility restructuring legislative oversight committee by November 1, 2000, why the agency was not able to meet this objective.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  The municipal power agency or its successor in interest may, at its option, use the rate of return method for calculating its transmission cost of service.  If the rate of return method is used, the return component for the transmission cost of service revenue requirement shall be sufficient to meet the transmission function's pro rata share of levelized debt service and debt service coverage ratio (1.50) and other annual debt obligations;  provided, however, that the total levelized debt service may not exceed the total debt service under the current payment schedule.  Any additional revenue generated by the methodology described in this subsection shall be applied to reduce the agency's outstanding indebtedness.</p>
