<p class="left"><a name="101.002"></a><a name="73427.63158"></a></p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 101.002.  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.  (a)  This subtitle is enacted to protect the public interest inherent in the rates and services of gas utilities.  The purpose of this subtitle is to establish a comprehensive and adequate regulatory system for gas utilities to assure rates, operations, and services that are just and reasonable to the consumers and to the utilities.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  Gas utilities are by definition monopolies in the areas they serve.  As a result, the normal forces of competition that regulate prices in a free enterprise society do not operate.  Public agencies regulate utility rates, operations, and services as a substitute for competition.</p>
