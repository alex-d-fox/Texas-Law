PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL UTILITIES</p><br /><p class="center">CHAPTER 11. GENERAL PROVISIONS</p><br /><p class="left"><a name="11.001"></a><a name="72302.62211"></a></p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 11.001.  SHORT TITLE.  This title may be cited as the Public Utility Regulatory Act.</p>
<p class="left">Acts 1997, 75th Leg., ch. 166, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1997.</p>

<p class="left"><a name="11.002"></a><a name="86258.74942"></a></p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 11.002.  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.  (a)  This title is enacted to protect the public interest inherent in the rates and services of public utilities.  The purpose of this title is to establish a comprehensive and adequate regulatory system for public utilities to assure rates, operations, and services that are just and reasonable to the consumers and to the utilities.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  Public utilities traditionally are by definition monopolies in the areas they serve.  As a result, the normal forces of competition that regulate prices in a free enterprise society do not operate.  Public agencies regulate utility rates, operations, and services as a substitute for competition.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  Significant changes have occurred in the telecommunications and electric power industries since the Public Utility Regulatory Act was originally adopted.  Changes in technology and market structure have increased the need for minimum standards of service quality, customer service, and fair business practices to ensure high-quality service to customers and a healthy marketplace where competition is permitted by law.  It is the purpose of this title to grant the Public Utility Commission of Texas authority to make and enforce rules necessary to protect customers of telecommunications and electric services consistent with the public interest.</p>
