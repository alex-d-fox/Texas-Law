The electric utility may file the application before the electric utility places into service the distribution investment to implement an approved plan. The commission may approve the rider application before the electric utility places into service the distribution investment to implement an approved plan.  The commission may not approve a rider that would allow an electric utility to begin recovering the distribution investment before the utility begins to use the investment to provide service to the public.
