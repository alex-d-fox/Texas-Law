GENERAL PROVISIONS</p><br /><p class="left"><a name="A"></a><a name="177996.173648"></a></p><p class="center">SUBCHAPTER A.  GENERAL PROVISIONS</p><br /><p class="left"><a name="31.001"></a><a name="72471.62348"></a></p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 31.001.  LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS;  PURPOSE OF SUBTITLE.  (a)  This subtitle is enacted to protect the public interest inherent in the rates and services of electric utilities.  The purpose of this subtitle is to establish a comprehensive and adequate regulatory system for electric utilities to assure rates, operations, and services that are just and reasonable to the consumers and to the electric utilities.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  Electric utilities are by definition monopolies in many of the services provided and areas they serve.  As a result, the normal forces of competition that regulate prices in a free enterprise society do not always operate.  Public agencies regulate electric utility rates, operations, and services, except as otherwise provided by this subtitle.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  The wholesale electric industry, through federal legislative, judicial, and administrative actions, is becoming a more competitive industry that does not lend itself to traditional electric utility regulatory rules, policies, and principles.  As a result, the public interest requires that rules, policies, and principles be formulated and applied to protect the public interest in a more competitive marketplace.  The development of a competitive wholesale electric market that allows for increased participation by electric utilities and certain nonutilities is in the public interest.</p>
