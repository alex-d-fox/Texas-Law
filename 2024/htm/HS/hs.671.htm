Death occurs when the relevant functions cease.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  Death must be pronounced before artificial means of supporting a person's respiratory and circulatory functions are terminated.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  A registered nurse, including an advanced practice registered nurse, or physician assistant may determine and pronounce a person dead in situations other than those described by Subsection (b) if permitted by written policies of a licensed health care facility, institution, or entity providing services to that person. Those policies must include physician assistants who are credentialed or otherwise permitted to practice at the facility, institution, or entity. If the facility, institution, or entity has an organized nursing staff and an organized medical staff or medical consultant, the nursing staff and medical staff or consultant shall jointly develop and approve those policies.
