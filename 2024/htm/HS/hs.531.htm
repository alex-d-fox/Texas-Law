SERVICES FOR PERSONS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS OR AN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY</p><br /><p class="center">CHAPTER 531. PROVISIONS GENERALLY APPLICABLE TO MENTAL HEALTH AND INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY SERVICES</p><br /><p class="left"><a name="531.001"></a><a name="160271.146939"></a></p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 531.001.  PURPOSE; POLICY.  (a)  It is the purpose of this subtitle to provide for the effective administration and coordination of mental health and intellectual disability services at the state and local levels.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  Recognizing that a variety of alternatives for serving persons with mental illness or an intellectual disability exists, it is the purpose of this subtitle to ensure that a continuum of services is provided.  The continuum of services includes:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  mental health facilities operated by the Department of State Health Services and community services for persons with mental illness provided by the department and other entities through contracts with the department; or</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  state supported living centers operated by the Department of Aging and Disability Services and community services for persons with an intellectual disability provided by the department and other entities through contracts with the department.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  It is the goal of this state to provide a comprehensive range of services for persons with mental illness or an intellectual disability who need publicly supported care, treatment, or habilitation.  In providing those services, efforts will be made to coordinate services and programs with services and programs provided by other governmental entities to minimize duplication and to share with other governmental entities in financing those services and programs.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  It is the policy of this state that, when appropriate and feasible, persons with mental illness or an intellectual disability shall be afforded treatment in their own communities.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  It is the public policy of this state that mental health and intellectual disability services be the responsibility of local agencies and organizations to the greatest extent possible.  The Department of State Health Services shall assist the local agencies and organizations by coordinating the implementation of a statewide system of mental health services.  The Department of Aging and Disability Services shall assist the local agencies and organizations by coordinating the implementation of a statewide system of intellectual disability services.  Each department shall ensure that mental health and intellectual disability services, as applicable, are provided.  Each department shall provide technical assistance for and regulation of the programs that receive funding through contracts with that department.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  It is the public policy of this state to offer services first to those persons who are most in need.  Therefore, funds appropriated by the legislature for mental health and intellectual disability services may be spent only to provide services to the priority populations identified in the applicable department's long-range plan.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  It is the goal of this state to establish at least one special officer for mental health assignment in each county.  To achieve this goal, the Department of State Health Services shall assist a local law enforcement agency that desires to have an officer certified under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&amp;Value=1701.404">1701.404</a>, Occupations Code.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  It is the policy of this state that the Department of State Health Services serves as the state's mental health authority and the Department of Aging and Disability Services serves as the state's intellectual disability authority.  The executive commissioner is responsible for the planning, policy development, and resource development and allocation for and oversight of mental health and intellectual disability services in this state.  It is the policy of this state that, when appropriate and feasible, the executive commissioner may delegate the executive commissioner's authority to a single entity in each region of the state that may function as the local mental health or intellectual and developmental disability authority for one or more service areas in the region.</p>
