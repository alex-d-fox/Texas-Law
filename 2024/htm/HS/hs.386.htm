The commission shall develop an appropriate method for converting incremental fuel costs over the lifetime of the motor vehicle or on-road or non-road diesel into an initial cost for purposes of determining cost-effectiveness as required by Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&amp;Value=386.105">386.105</a>.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  If the commission determines that a heavy-duty motor vehicle or engine under this chapter must be decommissioned, the commission shall require the decommissioning to be carried out by crushing the vehicle, by making a hole in the engine block and permanently destroying the frame of the vehicle, or by another method approved by the commission that permanently removes the vehicle from operation in this state.  The commission shall provide a means for an applicant to propose an alternative method for complying with the requirements of this subsection.  The commission shall enforce the requirements of this subsection.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  The executive director may waive any eligibility requirements established under this section on a finding of good cause, which may include a waiver for short lapses in registration or operation attributable to economic conditions, seasonal work, or other circumstances.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  The commission shall consider an application under this chapter for the replacement of a vehicle that has been owned, leased, or otherwise commercially financed by the applicant.
