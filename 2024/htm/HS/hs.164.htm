The purpose of this chapter is to safeguard the public against fraud, deceit, and misleading marketing practices and to foster and encourage competition and fair dealing by mental health facilities and chemical dependency treatment facilities by prohibiting or restricting practices by which the public has been injured in connection with the marketing and advertising of mental health services and the admission of patients.  Nothing in this chapter should be construed to prohibit a mental health facility from advertising its services in a general way or promoting its specialized services.  However, the public should be able to distinguish between the marketing activities of the facility and its clinical functions.</p>
