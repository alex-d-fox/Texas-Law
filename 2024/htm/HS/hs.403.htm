In the event the member states proceed in this manner, the payment schedule shall be determined in accordance with the schedule of debt repayment.

No person shall manage or dispose of any low-level radioactive waste within the party states unless the low-level radioactive waste was generated within the party states, except as provided in Section 3.05(6) of Article III. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the storage or management of low-level radioactive waste by a generator, nor its disposal pursuant to 10 C.F.R. Section 20.302.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 6.03. Violations of this article may result in prohibiting the violator from disposing of low-level radioactive waste in the compact facility, or in the imposition of penalty surcharges on shipments to the facility, as determined by the commission.</p><p class="center">ARTICLE VII. ELIGIBILITY;  ENTRY INTO EFFECT;  CONGRESSIONAL CONSENT;  WITHDRAWAL;  EXCLUSION</p><br /><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 7.01. The states of Texas, Maine, and Vermont are party states to this compact.  Any other state may be made eligible for party status by a majority vote of the commission and ratification by the legislature of the host state, subject to fulfillment of the rights of the initial nonhost party states under Section 3.04(11) of Article III and Section 4.01 of Article IV, and upon compliance with those terms and conditions for eligibility that the host state may establish.  The host state may establish all terms and conditions for the entry of any state, other than the states named in this section, as a member of this compact;  provided, however, the specific provisions of this compact, except for those pertaining to the composition of the commission and those pertaining to Section 7.09 of this article, may not be changed except upon ratification by the legislatures of the party states.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 7.02. Upon compliance with the other provisions of this compact, a state made eligible under Section 7.01 of this article may become a party state by legislative enactment of this compact or by executive order of the governor of the state adopting this compact.  A state becoming a party state by executive order shall cease to be a party state upon adjournment of the first general session of its legislature convened after the executive order is issued, unless before the adjournment, the legislature enacts this compact.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 7.03. Any party state may withdraw from this compact by repealing enactment of this compact subject to the provisions herein.  In the event the host state allows an additional state or additional states to join the compact, the host state's legislature, without the consent of the nonhost party states, shall have the right to modify the composition of the commission so that the host state shall have a voting majority on the commission;  provided, however, that any modification maintains the right of each initial party state to retain one voting member on the commission.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 7.04. If the host state withdraws from the compact, the withdrawal shall not become effective until five years after enactment of the repealing legislation and the nonhost party states may continue to use the facility during that time.  The financial obligation of the nonhost party states under Article V shall cease immediately upon enactment of the repealing legislation.  If the host state withdraws from the compact or abandons plans to operate a facility prior to the date of any nonhost party state payment under Sections 4.05(5) and (6), of Article IV or Article V, the nonhost party states are relieved of any obligations to make the contributions.  This section sets out the exclusive remedies for the nonhost party states if the host state withdraws from the compact or is unable to develop and operate a compact facility.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 7.05. A party state, other than the host state, may withdraw from the compact by repealing the enactment of this compact, but this withdrawal shall not become effective until two years after the effective date of the repealing legislation.  During this two-year period the party state will continue to have access to the facility.  The withdrawing party shall remain liable for any payments under Sections 4.05(5) and (6) of Article IV that were due during the two-year period and shall not be entitled to any refund of payments previously made.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 7.06. Any party state that substantially fails to comply with the terms of the compact or to fulfill its obligations hereunder may have its membership in the compact revoked by a seven-eighths vote of the commission following notice that a hearing will be scheduled not less than six months from the date of the notice.  In all other respects, revocation proceedings undertaken by the commission will be subject to Chapter <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&amp;Value=2001">2001</a>, Government Code, except that a party state may appeal the commission's revocation decision to the United States District Court in accordance with Section 3.06 of Article III. Revocation shall take effect one year from the date such party state receives written notice from the commission of a final action.  Written notice of revocation shall be transmitted immediately following the vote of the commission, by the chair, to the governor of the affected party state, all other governors of party states, and to the United States Congress.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 7.07. This compact shall take effect following its enactment under the laws of the host state and any other party state and thereafter upon the consent of the United States Congress and shall remain in effect until otherwise provided by federal law.  If Texas and either Maine or Vermont ratify this compact, the compact shall be in full force and effect as to Texas and the other ratifying state, and this compact shall be interpreted as follows:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  Texas and the other ratifying state are the initial party states.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  The commission shall consist of two voting members from the other ratifying state and six from Texas.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  Each party state is responsible for its pro-rata share of the commission's expenses.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 7.08.

CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY</p><br /><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 8.01. The provisions of this compact shall be broadly construed to carry out the purposes of the compact, but the sovereign powers of a party shall not be infringed upon unnecessarily.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 8.02. This compact does not affect any judicial proceeding pending on the effective date of this compact.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 8.03. No party state acquires any liability, by joining this compact, resulting from the siting, operation, maintenance, long-term care, or any other activity relating to the compact facility.  No nonhost party state shall be liable for any harm or damage from the siting, operation, maintenance, or long-term care relating to the compact facility.  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this compact, nothing in this compact shall be construed to alter the incidence of liability of any kind for any act or failure to act.  Generators, transporters, owners, and operators of the facility shall be liable for their acts, omissions, conduct, or relationships in accordance with applicable law.  By entering into this compact and securing the ratification by congress of its terms, no party state acquires a potential liability under Section 5(d)(2)(C) of the Act (42 U.S.C. Section 2021e(d)(2)(C)) that did not exist prior to entering into this compact.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 8.04. If a party state withdraws from the compact pursuant to Section 7.03 of Article VII or has its membership in this compact revoked pursuant to Section 7.06 of Article VII, the withdrawal or revocation shall not affect any liability already incurred by or chargeable to the affected state under Section 8.03 of this article.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 8.05. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this compact is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstances is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby to the extent the remainder can in all fairness be given effect.  If any provision of this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 8.06. Nothing in this compact diminishes or otherwise impairs the jurisdiction, authority, or discretion of either of the following:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C.
