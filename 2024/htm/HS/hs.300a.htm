MANDATORY PAYMENTS BASED ON PAYING HOSPITAL NET PATIENT REVENUE.  (a)  Except as provided by Subsection (e), if the board authorizes a health care provider participation program under this chapter, the district shall require an annual mandatory payment to be assessed on the net patient revenue of each institutional health care provider located in the district.  The board shall provide that the mandatory payment is to be assessed at least annually, but not more often than quarterly.  In the first year in which the mandatory payment is required, the mandatory payment is assessed on the net patient revenue of an institutional health care provider located in the district as determined by the data reported to the Department of State Health Services under Sections <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&amp;Value=311.032">311.032</a> and <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&amp;Value=311.033">311.033</a> in the most recent fiscal year for which that data was reported.  If the institutional health care provider did not report any data under those sections, the provider's net patient revenue is the amount of that revenue as contained in the provider's Medicare cost report submitted for the previous fiscal year or for the closest subsequent fiscal year for which the provider submitted the Medicare cost report.

Section 1396b(w).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  The board shall set the amount of a mandatory payment authorized under this chapter.  The aggregate amount of the mandatory payments required of all paying hospitals in the district may not exceed six percent of the aggregate net patient revenue from hospital services provided by all paying hospitals in the district.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  Subject to Subsection (c), the board shall set the mandatory payments in amounts that in the aggregate will generate sufficient revenue to cover the administrative expenses of the district for activities under this chapter and to fund an intergovernmental transfer described by Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&amp;Value=300A.0103">300A.0103</a>(b)(1).
