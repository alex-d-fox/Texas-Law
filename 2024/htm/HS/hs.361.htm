The appropriate extent of the remedial action at any particular facility shall be determined by the commission's selection of the remedial alternative that the commission determines is the lowest cost alternative that is technologically feasible and reliable and that effectively mitigates and minimizes damage to and provides adequate protection of the public health and safety or the environment.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  In considering the appropriate remedial action program at a particular facility, the commission may approve a program that does not attain a level or standard of control at least equivalent to a legally applicable or relevant and appropriate standard, requirement, criterion, or limitation, as required by state or local law, if the commission finds that:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the remedial action selected is only part of a total remedial action that will attain that level or standard of control when completed;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  compliance with the requirement at that facility will result in greater risk to public health and safety or the environment than alternative options;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  compliance with the requirement is technically impracticable from an engineering perspective;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  the remedial action selected will attain a standard of performance that is equivalent to that required under the otherwise applicable standard, requirement, criterion, or limitation through use of another method or approach;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(5)  with respect to a local standard, requirement, criterion, or limitation, the locality has not consistently applied or demonstrated the intention to consistently apply the standard, requirement, criterion, or limitation in similar circumstances of other remedial actions within the locality;  or</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(6)  with respect to an action using solely state funds, selection of a remedial action that attains those levels or standards of control will not provide a balance between the need for protection of public health and safety or the environment at the facility and the availability of state funds to respond to other sites that present a threat to public health and safety or the environment, taking into consideration the relative immediacy of the threats.</p>

(a)  In addition to all other remedies available to the state under this chapter or other law, all remediation costs for which a person is liable to the state constitute a lien in favor of the state on the real property and the rights to the real property that are subject to or affected by a remedial action.  This provision is cumulative of other remedies available to the state under this chapter.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  The lien imposed by this section arises and attaches to the real property subject to or affected by a remedial action at the time an affidavit is recorded and indexed in accordance with this section in the county in which the real property is located. For the purpose of determining rights of all affected parties, the lien does not relate back to a time before the date on which the affidavit is recorded, which date is the lien inception date.  The lien continues until the liability for the costs is satisfied or becomes unenforceable through operation of law.  The executive director shall determine whether to prepare an affidavit.  In determining whether to prepare an affidavit or whether a lien is satisfied, the executive director:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  shall proceed in the manner that the executive director determines will most likely result in the least overall costs to the state after any cost recovery action;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  may take into account a landowner's financial ability to satisfy the lien, including consideration of whether the landowner received financial compensation for the disposal of any substance addressed by the remedial action and whether the real property that is the subject of the lien:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  is a homestead and is being occupied as a home by the landowner;  and</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  has a fair market value of $250,000 or less.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  An authorized representative of the commission must execute the affidavit.  The affidavit must show:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the names and addresses of the persons liable for the costs;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  a description of the real property that is subject to or affected by the remediation action for the costs or claims;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  the amount of the costs and the balance due.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  The county clerk shall record the affidavit in records kept for that purpose and shall index the affidavit under the names of the persons liable for the costs.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  The commission shall record a relinquishment or satisfaction of the lien when the lien is paid or satisfied.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  The lien may be foreclosed only on judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction foreclosing the lien and ordering the sale of the property subject to the lien.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  The lien imposed by this section is not valid or enforceable if real property, an interest in real property, or a mortgage, lien, or other encumbrance on or against real property is acquired before the affidavit is recorded, unless the person acquiring the real property, an interest in the property, or the mortgage, lien, or other encumbrance on the property had or reasonably should have had actual notice or knowledge that the real property is subject to or affected by a clean-up action or has knowledge that the state has incurred clean-up costs.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  If a lien is fixed or attempted to be fixed as provided by this section, the owner of the real property affected by the lien may file a bond to indemnify against the lien.  The bond must be filed with the county clerk of the county in which the real property subject to the lien is located.  An action to establish, enforce, or foreclose any lien or claim of lien covered by the bond must be brought not later than the 30th day after the date of service of notice of the bond.  The bond must:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  describe the real property on which the lien is claimed;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  refer to the lien claimed in a manner sufficient to identify it;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  be in an amount double the amount of the lien referred to;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  be payable to the commission;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(5)  be executed by the party filing the bond as principal and a corporate surety authorized under the law of this state to execute the bond as surety;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(6)  be conditioned substantially that the principal and sureties will pay to the commission the amount of the lien claimed, plus costs, if the claim is proved to be a lien on the real property.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  After the bond is filed, the county clerk shall issue notice of the bond to the named obligee.  A copy of the bond must be attached to the notice.  The notice may be served on each obligee by having a copy delivered to the obligee by any person competent to make oath of the delivery.  The original notice shall be returned to the office of the county clerk, and the person making service of copy shall make an oath on the back of the copies showing on whom and on what date the copies were served.  The county clerk shall record the bond notice and return in records kept for that purpose.  In acquiring an interest in real property, a purchaser or lender may rely on and is absolutely protected by the record of the bond, notice, and return.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  The commission may sue on the bond after the 30th day after the date on which the notice is served but may not sue on the bond later than one year after the date on which the notice is served.  The commission is entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees if the commission recovers in a suit on the lien or on the bond.</p>

In this subchapter:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  "Compost" is the disinfected and stabilized product of the decomposition process that is used or sold for use as a soil amendment, artificial top soil, growing medium amendment, or other similar uses.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  "Composting" means the controlled biological decomposition of organic materials through microbial activity.  Depending on the specific application, composting can serve as both a volume reduction and a waste treatment measure.  A beneficial organic composting activity is an appropriate waste management solution that shall divert compatible materials from the solid waste stream that cannot be recycled into higher grade uses and convert these materials into a useful product that is put to beneficial reuse as a soil amendment or mulch.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  "Life-cycle cost benefit analysis" means a method of determining the total equivalent costs and benefits of using products over their lifetimes or over any other period of time.  These costs and benefits are all associated costs and all associated benefits of each product over the time under consideration and include initial costs, annual operating costs, annual savings, future costs, and residual (salvage) values.  The use of this method permits exact comparisons of these total costs and benefits to determine the most cost-effective product.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  "Postconsumer waste" means a material or product that has served its intended use and has been discarded after passing through the hands of a final user.  For the purpose of this subchapter, the term does not include industrial or hazardous waste.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(5)  "Recyclable material" means material that can be or has been recovered or diverted from the waste stream for purposes of reuse, recycling, or reclamation, a substantial portion of which is consistently used in the manufacture of products which may otherwise be produced using raw or virgin materials.  The term includes any waste stream, including post-use polymers and recoverable feedstocks that are converted through pyrolysis, gasification, solvolysis, or depolymerization into valuable raw materials or valuable intermediate and final products.  Recyclable material is not solid waste unless the material is deemed to be hazardous solid waste by the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, whereupon it shall be regulated accordingly unless it is otherwise exempted in whole or in part from regulation under the federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (42 U.S.C. Section 6901 et seq.), by Environmental Protection Agency regulation.  However, recyclable material may become solid waste at such time, if any, as it is abandoned or disposed of rather than recycled, whereupon it will be solid waste with respect only to the party actually abandoning or disposing of the material.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(6)  "Recycled material" means materials, goods, or products that consist of recovered recyclable material or materials derived from recoverable feedstocks, post-use polymers, postconsumer waste, industrial waste, or hazardous waste which may be used in place of a raw or virgin material in manufacturing a new product or that are certified under a third-party certification system for mass balance attribution identified by the commission under Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&amp;Value=361.4215">361.4215</a>.

The term does not include a product sold as fuel.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(8)  "Recycling" means a process by which materials that have served their intended use or are scrapped, discarded, used, surplus, or obsolete are collected, separated, or processed and returned to use in the form of raw materials or feedstocks used in the manufacture of new products.  The term does not include incineration of plastics or waste-to-energy processes.  Recycling includes:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  the composting process if the compost material is put to beneficial reuse as defined by the commission;</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  the application to land, as organic fertilizer, of processed sludge or biosolids from municipal wastewater treatment plants and other organic matter resulting from poultry, dairy, livestock, or other agricultural operations; and</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(C)  the conversion of post-use polymers and recoverable feedstocks through pyrolysis, gasification, solvolysis, or depolymerization.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(9)  "Source reduction" means an activity or process that avoids the creation of municipal solid waste in the state by reducing waste at the source and includes:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  redesigning a product or packaging so that less material is ultimately disposed of;</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  changing a process for producing a good or providing a service so that less material is disposed of;  or</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(C)  changing the way a material is used so that the amount of waste generated is reduced.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(10)  "State agency" means a department, commission, board, office, council, or other agency in the executive branch of government that is created by the constitution or a statute of this state and has authority not limited to a geographical portion of the state.  The term does not include a university system or institution of higher education as defined by Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&amp;Value=61.003">61.003</a>, Education Code.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(11)  "Virgin material" means a raw material used in manufacturing that has not yet become a product.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(12)  "Yard waste" means leaves, grass clippings, yard and garden debris, and brush, including clean woody vegetative material not greater than six inches in diameter, that results from landscaping maintenance and land-clearing operations.
