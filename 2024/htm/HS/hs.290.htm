The district shall update this tax basis with the number of emergency room visits reported on a biennial basis.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  A tax imposed under this section must be imposed uniformly on each institutional health care provider of emergency room services located in the district.

Section 1396b(w).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  The commission shall set the rate of the tax imposed under this section.
