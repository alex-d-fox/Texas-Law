The governing body of the local government shall provide that the mandatory payment is to be assessed at least annually, but not more often than quarterly.  In the first year in which the mandatory payment is required, the mandatory payment is assessed on the net patient revenue of an institutional health care provider located in the hospital district, county, or municipality, as applicable, as determined by the data reported to the Department of State Health Services under Sections <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&amp;Value=311.032">311.032</a> and <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&amp;Value=311.033">311.033</a> in the most recent fiscal year for which that data was reported.
