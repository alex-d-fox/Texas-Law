A written directive may be in the following form:</p><p class="center">DIRECTIVE TO PHYSICIANS AND FAMILY OR SURROGATES</p><br /><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Instructions for completing this document:</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">This is an important legal document known as an Advance Directive.  It is designed to help you communicate your wishes about medical treatment at some time in the future when you are unable to make your wishes known because of illness or injury.  These wishes are usually based on personal values.  In particular, you may want to consider what burdens or hardships of treatment you would be willing to accept for a particular amount of benefit obtained if you were seriously ill.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">You are encouraged to discuss your values and wishes with your family or chosen spokesperson, as well as your physician.  Your physician, other health care provider, or medical institution may provide you with various resources to assist you in completing your advance directive.  Brief definitions are listed below and may aid you in your discussions and advance planning.  Initial the treatment choices that best reflect your personal preferences.  Provide a copy of your directive to your physician, usual hospital, and family or spokesperson.  Consider a periodic review of this document.  By periodic review, you can best assure that the directive reflects your preferences.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">In addition to this advance directive, Texas law provides for two other types of directives that can be important during a serious illness.  These are the Medical Power of Attorney and the Out-of-Hospital Do-Not-Resuscitate Order.  You may wish to discuss these with your physician, family, hospital representative, or other advisers.  You may also wish to complete a directive related to the donation of organs and tissues.</p><p class="center">DIRECTIVE</p><br /><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">I, __________, recognize that the best health care is based upon a partnership of trust and communication with my physician.  My physician and I will make health care or treatment decisions together as long as I am of sound mind and able to make my wishes known.  If there comes a time that I am unable to make medical decisions about myself because of illness or injury, I direct that the following treatment preferences be honored:</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">If, in the judgment of my physician, I am suffering with a terminal condition from which I am expected to die within six months, even with available life-sustaining treatment provided in accordance with prevailing standards of medical care:</p><table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><th align="" width="%" valign="top"></th><th align="" width="60%" valign="top"></th></tr><tr valign="top"><td align="" valign="top">__________</td><td align="" valign="top">I request that all treatments other than those needed to keep me comfortable be discontinued or withheld and my physician allow me to die as gently as possible;  OR</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td align="" valign="top">__________</td><td align="" valign="top">I request that I be kept alive in this terminal condition using available life-sustaining treatment.  (THIS SELECTION DOES NOT APPLY TO HOSPICE CARE.)</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="left">If, in the judgment of my physician, I am suffering with an irreversible condition so that I cannot care for myself or make decisions for myself and am expected to die without life-sustaining treatment provided in accordance with prevailing standards of care:</p><table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><th align="" width="%" valign="top"></th><th align="" width="60%" valign="top"></th></tr><tr valign="top"><td align="" valign="top">__________</td><td align="" valign="top">I request that all treatments other than those needed to keep me comfortable be discontinued or withheld and my physician allow me to die as gently as possible;  OR</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td align="" valign="top">__________</td><td align="" valign="top">I request that I be kept alive in this irreversible condition using available life-sustaining treatment.

If, in the judgment of my physician, my death is imminent within minutes to hours, even with the use of all available medical treatment provided within the prevailing standard of care, I acknowledge that all treatments may be withheld or removed except those needed to maintain my comfort.  I understand that under Texas law this directive has no effect if I have been diagnosed as pregnant.  This directive will remain in effect until I revoke it.  No other person may do so.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Signed__________ Date__________ City, County, State of Residence __________</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Two competent adult witnesses must sign below, acknowledging the signature of the declarant.  The witness designated as Witness 1 may not be a person designated to make a health care or treatment decision for the patient and may not be related to the patient by blood or marriage.  This witness may not be entitled to any part of the estate and may not have a claim against the estate of the patient.  This witness may not be the attending physician or an employee of the attending physician.  If this witness is an employee of a health care facility in which the patient is being cared for, this witness may not be involved in providing direct patient care to the patient.  This witness may not be an officer, director, partner, or business office employee of a health care facility in which the patient is being cared for or of any parent organization of the health care facility.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Witness 1 __________ Witness 2 __________</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Definitions:</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">"Artificially administered nutrition and hydration" means the provision of nutrients or fluids by a tube inserted in a vein, under the skin in the subcutaneous tissues, or in the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">"Irreversible condition" means a condition, injury, or illness:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  that may be treated, but is never cured or eliminated;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  that leaves a person unable to care for or make decisions for the person's own self; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  that, without life-sustaining treatment provided in accordance with the prevailing standard of medical care, is fatal.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Explanation:  Many serious illnesses such as cancer, failure of major organs (kidney, heart, liver, or lung), and serious brain disease such as Alzheimer's dementia may be considered irreversible early on.  There is no cure, but the patient may be kept alive for prolonged periods of time if the patient receives life-sustaining treatments.  Late in the course of the same illness, the disease may be considered terminal when, even with treatment, the patient is expected to die.  You may wish to consider which burdens of treatment you would be willing to accept in an effort to achieve a particular outcome.  This is a very personal decision that you may wish to discuss with your physician, family, or other important persons in your life.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">"Life-sustaining treatment" means treatment that, based on reasonable medical judgment, sustains the life of a patient and without which the patient will die.  The term includes both life-sustaining medications and artificial life support such as mechanical breathing machines, kidney dialysis treatment, and artificially administered nutrition and hydration.  The term does not include the administration of pain management medication, the performance of a medical procedure necessary to provide comfort care, or any other medical care provided to alleviate a patient's pain.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">"Terminal condition" means an incurable condition caused by injury, disease, or illness that according to reasonable medical judgment will produce death within six months, even with available life-sustaining treatment provided in accordance with the prevailing standard of medical care.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Explanation:  Many serious illnesses may be considered irreversible early in the course of the illness, but they may not be considered terminal until the disease is fairly advanced.  In thinking about terminal illness and its treatment, you again may wish to consider the relative benefits and burdens of treatment and discuss your wishes with your physician, family, or other important persons in your life.</p>

Because "health care" means any treatment, service, or procedure to maintain, diagnose, or treat your physical or mental condition, your agent has the power to make a broad range of health care decisions for you.  Your agent may consent, refuse to consent, or withdraw consent to medical treatment and may make decisions about withdrawing or withholding life-sustaining treatment.  Your agent may not consent to voluntary inpatient mental health services, convulsive treatment, psychosurgery, or abortion.  A physician must comply with your agent's instructions or allow you to be transferred to another physician.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Your agent's authority is effective when your doctor certifies that you lack the competence to make health care decisions.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Your agent is obligated to follow your instructions when making decisions on your behalf.  Unless you state otherwise, your agent has the same authority to make decisions about your health care as you would have if you were able to make health care decisions for yourself.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">It is important that you discuss this document with your physician or other health care provider before you sign the document to ensure that you understand the nature and range of decisions that may be made on your behalf.  If you do not have a physician, you should talk with someone else who is knowledgeable about these issues and can answer your questions.  You do not need a lawyer's assistance to complete this document, but if there is anything in this document that you do not understand, you should ask a lawyer to explain it to you.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">The person you appoint as agent should be someone you know and trust.  The person must be 18 years of age or older or a person under 18 years of age who has had the disabilities of minority removed.  If you appoint your health or residential care provider (e.g., your physician or an employee of a home health agency, hospital, nursing facility, or residential care facility, other than a relative), that person has to choose between acting as your agent or as your health or residential care provider; the law does not allow a person to serve as both at the same time.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">You should inform the person you appoint that you want the person to be your health care agent.  You should discuss this document with your agent and your physician and give each a signed copy.  You should indicate on the document itself the people and institutions that you intend to have signed copies.  Your agent is not liable for health care decisions made in good faith on your behalf.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Once you have signed this document, you have the right to make health care decisions for yourself as long as you are able to make those decisions, and treatment cannot be given to you or stopped over your objection.  You have the right to revoke the authority granted to your agent by informing your agent or your health or residential care provider orally or in writing or by your execution of a subsequent medical power of attorney.
