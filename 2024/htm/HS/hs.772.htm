INFORMATION RELATING TO COLLECTION AND REMITTANCE OF 9-1-1 EMERGENCY SERVICE FEE.

This section does not apply to an incumbent local exchange company as defined in Section <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=51.002">51.002</a>, Utilities Code.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  The board of managers of a district by order may require a service supplier or business service user to provide to the district any information the board requires so long as that information and the format requested are readily available for the service provider's records to determine whether the service provider or business service user is correctly billing and collecting the 9-1-1 emergency service fee and remitting the fee to the district.

It is the purpose of this subchapter to establish the number 9-1-1 as the primary emergency telephone number for use by certain local governments in this state and to encourage units of local government and combinations of the units to develop and improve emergency communication procedures and facilities in a manner that makes possible the quick response to any person calling the telephone number 9-1-1 seeking police, fire, medical, rescue, and other emergency services.  To this purpose the legislature finds that:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  it is in the public interest to shorten the time required for a citizen to request and receive emergency aid; </p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  there exist thousands of different emergency telephone numbers throughout the state, and telephone exchange boundaries and central office service areas do not necessarily correspond to public safety and political boundaries; </p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  a dominant part of the state's population is located in rapidly expanding metropolitan areas that generally cross the boundary lines of local jurisdictions and often extend into two or more counties;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  provision of a single, primary three-digit emergency number through which emergency services can be quickly and efficiently obtained would provide a significant contribution to law enforcement and other public safety efforts by making it less difficult to notify public safety personnel quickly.</p>

The certificate of delinquency is prima facie evidence that a fee included in the certificate is delinquent.  A service user account is considered delinquent if the fee is not paid to the service supplier before the 31st day after the payment due date stated on the user's bill from the service supplier.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  The district may institute legal proceedings to collect fees not paid and may establish internal collection procedures and recover the cost of collection from the nonpaying service user.  If legal proceedings are established, the court may award the district court costs, attorney's fees, and interest to be paid by the nonpaying service user.  A delinquent fee accrues interest at an annual rate of 12 percent beginning on the date the payment becomes due.</p>

It is the purpose of this subchapter to establish the number 9-1-1 as the primary emergency telephone number for use by certain local governments in this state and to encourage units of local government and combinations of those units to develop and improve emergency communication procedures and facilities in a manner that will make possible the quick response to any person calling the telephone number 9-1-1 seeking police, fire, medical, rescue, and other emergency services.  To this purpose the legislature finds that:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  it is in the public interest to shorten the time required for a citizen to request and receive emergency aid; </p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  there exist thousands of different emergency telephone numbers throughout the state, and telephone exchange boundaries and central office service areas do not necessarily correspond to public safety and political boundaries; </p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  a dominant part of the state's population is located in rapidly expanding metropolitan areas that generally cross the boundary lines of local jurisdictions and often extend into two or more counties;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  provision of a single, primary three-digit emergency number through which emergency services can be quickly and efficiently obtained would provide a significant contribution to law enforcement and other public safety efforts by making it less difficult to notify public safety personnel quickly.</p>

If the revenue received from the fee exceeds the amount of money needed to fund the district, the board by resolution shall reduce the rate of the fee to an amount adequate to fund the district or suspend the imposition of the fee.

However, the service supplier shall provide the district with an annual certificate of delinquency that includes the amount of all delinquent fees and the name and address of each nonpaying service user.  The certificate of delinquency is prima facie evidence that a fee included in the certificate is delinquent.  A service user account is considered delinquent if the fee is not paid to the service supplier before the 31st day after the payment due date stated on the user's bill from the service supplier.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  The district may institute legal proceedings to collect fees not paid and may establish internal collection procedures and recover the cost of collection from the nonpaying service user.  If the district prevails in legal proceedings instituted to collect a fee, the court may award the district court costs, attorney's fees, and interest in addition to other amounts recovered.  A delinquent fee accrues interest at an annual rate of 12 percent beginning on the date the payment becomes due.</p>

It is the purpose of this subchapter to establish the number 9-1-1 as the primary emergency telephone number for use by certain local governments in this state and to encourage units of local government and combinations of those units to develop and improve emergency communication procedures and facilities in a manner that will make possible the quick response to any person calling the telephone number 9-1-1 seeking police, fire, medical, rescue, and other emergency services.  To this purpose the legislature finds that:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  it is in the public interest to shorten the time required for a citizen to request and receive emergency aid; </p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  there exist thousands of different emergency telephone numbers throughout the state, and telephone exchange boundaries and central office service areas do not necessarily correspond to public safety and political boundaries; </p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  a dominant part of the state's population is located in rapidly expanding metropolitan areas that generally cross the boundary lines of local jurisdictions and often extend into two or more counties;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  provision of a single, primary three-digit emergency number through which emergency services can be quickly and efficiently obtained would provide a significant contribution to law enforcement and other public safety efforts by making it less difficult to notify public safety personnel quickly.</p>

The certificate of delinquency is prima facie evidence that a fee included in the certificate is delinquent.  A service user account is considered delinquent if the fee is not paid to the service supplier before the 31st day after the payment due date stated on the user's bill from the service supplier.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  The district may institute legal proceedings to collect fees not paid and may establish internal collection procedures and recover the cost of collection from the nonpaying service user.  If the district prevails in legal proceedings instituted to collect a fee, the court may award the district court costs, attorney's fees, and interest in addition to other amounts recovered.  A delinquent fee accrues interest at an annual rate of 12 percent beginning on the date the payment becomes due.</p>
