(a)  Except as provided by Subsection (e), if the commissioners court of a county authorizes a program under this chapter, the commissioners court may require an annual mandatory payment to be assessed on the net patient revenue of each institutional health care provider located in the county.  The commissioners court shall provide that the mandatory payment is to be assessed at least annually, but not more often than quarterly.  In the first year in which the mandatory payment is required, the mandatory payment is assessed on the net patient revenue of an institutional health care provider as determined by the data reported to the Department of State Health Services under Sections <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&amp;Value=311.032">311.032</a> and <a target="new" href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&amp;Value=311.033">311.033</a> in the most recent fiscal year for which that data was reported.
