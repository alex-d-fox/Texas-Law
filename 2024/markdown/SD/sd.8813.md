    Sec. 8813.056.  METHOD OF APPOINTMENT OF DIRECTORS.  (a)  The governing bodies of the districts and municipalities located within each director precinct jointly shall appoint one director to represent the precinct by a vote conducted as provided by this section.
    
    (b)  If a district or municipality is located within two or more director precincts, the district or municipality is considered, for purposes of this section, to be located only within the director precinct in which the greatest amount of territory of the district or municipality is located.
    
    (c)  For the appointment of a director for a director precinct, the board shall determine the number of votes each district or municipality may cast.  The number of votes for a governing body of a district or municipality within the precinct is equal to the number computed by dividing the total number of units of water, as determined by the board, used within the precinct by the district or municipality during the calendar year preceding the year in which the director is selected by the total number of units of water used within the precinct by all districts and municipalities in the precinct, multiplying that quotient by 100, and rounding that result to the nearest one-tenth.  The board shall provide the presiding officer of each governing body of a district or municipality within each director precinct written notice of the number of votes computed for that governing body to cast.
    
    (d)  For purposes of Subsection (c), the board shall determine the amount of water usage of all districts and municipalities within each director precinct.
    
    (e)  In the appropriate even-numbered year, the governing body of each district or municipality in a director precinct by resolution may nominate one candidate for the position of director for that director precinct.  Each district or municipality shall submit the name of its candidate, if any, to the presiding officer of the authority by February 15 of that year.  If by February 15 of that year only one candidate's name is submitted for the position of director for a director precinct, the board may declare the unopposed candidate elected and may cancel the director appointment procedures generally required by this section for that position.  If more than one candidate's name is submitted for the position of director for a director precinct, before March 15 of that year the board shall prepare, for the director precinct or precincts from which a director is being appointed, a ballot listing all of the candidates for that director precinct and shall provide a copy of the appropriate ballot to the presiding officer of the governing body of each district or municipality located within the director precinct from which a director is being appointed.
    
    (f)  An individual may not be listed as a candidate on the ballot for more than one director position.  If a candidate is nominated for more than one director position, the candidate must choose to be on the ballot for only one director position.
    
    (g)  The governing body of each district or municipality shall determine its votes for director by resolution and submit them to the presiding officer of the authority before May 1 of the appropriate even-numbered year.  In casting its votes for director, the governing body of each district or municipality may vote for only one candidate on the ballot for the director precinct in which the district or municipality is located.  For each director precinct from which a director is being appointed, the board shall count the votes, declare elected the candidate who received the greatest number of votes from districts and municipalities located within that director precinct, and submit the results before May 15 of that year to the governing body of each district or municipality within that director precinct.
    
    (h)  The board may adopt rules regarding:
    
    (1)  the manner and timing of determinations and calculations required by this section;
    
    (2)  the reporting of water usage to the authority by districts and municipalities; and
    
    (3)  the conduct and process of the appointment of directors.

A vacancy in the office of director shall be filled by appointment by the governing bodies of the districts and municipalities that are located within the director precinct for which the vacancy occurred.

The Harris-Galveston Subsidence District and Fort Bend Subsidence District shall provide to the authority a list of persons who hold such a permit.
    
    (f)  The board may establish rules regarding procedures for a hearing.  A hearing on the services or improvement project, whether conducted by the board or a hearings examiner, may be adjourned from time to time.  At the conclusion of a hearing conducted by the board, the board shall make written findings and conclusions relating to the advisability of the improvement project or services, the nature of the improvement project or services, the estimated cost, and the area benefited.  If the board appoints a hearings examiner to conduct the hearing, after conclusion of the hearing, the hearings examiner shall file with the board a written report of the examiner's findings and conclusions.
    
    (g)  At a hearing on proposed assessments, on adjournment of the hearing, or after consideration of the hearings examiner's report, the board shall hear and rule on all objections to each proposed assessment.

    (1)  shall impose the assessments as special assessments on the property;
    
    (2)  shall specify the method of payment of the assessments; and
    
    (3)  may provide that those assessments, including interest, be paid in periodic installments.
    
    (h)  Periodic installments must be in amounts sufficient to meet annual costs for services and improvements as provided by Subsection (j) and continue for the number of years required to retire the indebtedness or pay for the services to be rendered.  The board may provide interest charges or penalties for failure to make timely payment and may impose an amount to cover delinquencies and expenses of collection.
    
    (i)  If assessments are imposed for more than one service or improvement project, the board may provide that assessments collected for one service or improvement project may be borrowed to be used for another service or improvement project.  The board shall establish a procedure for the distribution or use of any assessments in excess of those necessary to finance the services or improvement project for which those assessments were collected.
    
    (j)  The board shall apportion the cost of an improvement project or services to be assessed against the property in the authority according to the special benefits that accrue to the property because of the improvement project or services.  The board may assess the cost only according to the number of gallons of groundwater pumped from wells within the authority that are subject to a groundwater reduction requirement imposed by the Harris-Galveston Subsidence District or Fort Bend Subsidence District, as applicable.  The board may not assess the cost according to groundwater pumped from:
    
    (1)  a well with a casing diameter of less than five inches that serves only a single-family dwelling; or
    
    (2)  a well that is regulated by Chapter [27](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=27), Water Code.

    (m)  Notwithstanding Subsection (l), the owner of land annexed to the authority after the authority has imposed assessments may waive the right to notice and an assessment hearing and may agree to the imposition and payment of assessments at an agreed rate for land annexed to the authority.  A district or municipality may waive the right to notice and an assessment hearing for land within its boundaries annexed to the authority and may agree to the imposition and payment of assessments at an agreed rate for the annexed land.
    
    (n)  The board shall have prepared an assessment roll showing the assessments against each property and the board's basis for the assessment.  The assessment roll shall be:
    
    (1)  filed with the secretary of the board or other officer who performs the function of secretary; and
    
    (2)  open for public inspection.
    
    (o)  After notice and hearing in the manner required for an original assessment, the board may make supplemental assessments to correct omissions or mistakes in the assessment:
    
    (1)  relating to the total cost of the improvement project or services; or
    
    (2)  covering delinquencies or costs of collection.
