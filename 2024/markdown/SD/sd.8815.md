    Sec. 8815.055.  METHOD OF APPOINTMENT OF DIRECTORS.  (a)  One director is appointed from each of the three director precincts and two directors are appointed at large.  Two directors from director precincts and one director at large shall be appointed in the first even-numbered year after the authority is created, and one director from a director precinct and one director at large shall be appointed in the next even-numbered year after the authority is created.  Each subsequent even-numbered year, the appropriate number of directors shall be appointed.
    
    (b)  In the appropriate even-numbered year, the governing bodies of the member districts located within a director precinct jointly shall appoint one director to represent the precinct by a vote conducted as provided by this section.  Each even-numbered year, the governing bodies of each member district shall appoint one director for an at-large position by a vote conducted as provided by this section.
    
    (c)  If a member district is located within two or more director precincts, the member district is considered, for purposes of this subchapter, to be located only within the director precinct in which the greatest amount of territory of the member district is located.
    
    (d)  For the appointment of a director for a director precinct, the board shall determine the number of votes each member district may cast. The number of votes for a governing body of a member district within the precinct is equal to the number computed by dividing the total number of units of water, as determined by the board, used within the member district during the calendar year preceding the year in which the director is selected by the total number of units of water used by all member districts in the precinct, multiplying that quotient by 100, and rounding that result to the nearest one-tenth.  The board shall provide the presiding officer of each governing body of a member district within each director precinct written notice of the number of votes computed for that governing body to cast.
    
    (e)  For the appointment of a director for an at-large position, the board shall determine the number of votes each member district may cast.  The number of votes for a governing body of a member district is equal to the number computed by dividing the total number of units of water, as determined by the board, used within the member district during the calendar year preceding the year in which the director is selected by the total number of units of water used by all member districts in the authority, multiplying that quotient by 100, and rounding that result to the nearest one-tenth.  The board shall provide the presiding officer of each governing body of a member district written notice of the number of votes computed for that governing body to cast.
    
    (f)  For purposes of Subsections (d) and (e), the board shall determine the amount of water usage of all member districts within each director precinct.
    
    (g)  In the appropriate even-numbered year, the governing body of each member district in a director precinct by resolution may nominate one candidate for the position of director for that director precinct.  Each member district shall submit the name of its candidate, if any, to the presiding officer of the authority by February 15 of that year.  If by February 15 of that year only one candidate's name is submitted for the position of director for a director precinct, the board may declare the unopposed candidate elected and may cancel the director appointment procedures generally required by this section for that position.  If more than one candidate's name is submitted for the position of director for a director precinct, before March 15 of that year, the board shall prepare, for the director precinct or precincts from which a director is being appointed, a ballot listing all of the candidates for that director precinct and shall provide a copy of the appropriate ballot to the presiding officer of the governing body of each member district located within the director precinct or precincts from which a director is being appointed.
    
    (h)  The governing body of each member district in the authority by resolution may nominate one candidate for the at-large director position.  Each member district shall submit the name of its candidate, if any, to the presiding officer of the authority by February 15 of each even-numbered year.  If by February 15 of that year only one candidate's name is submitted for the at-large director position, the board may declare the unopposed candidate elected and may cancel the director appointment procedures generally required by this section for that position.  If more than one candidate's name is submitted for the at-large director position, before March 15 of that year, the board shall prepare a ballot listing all of the candidates for the at-large director position and shall provide a copy of the ballot to the presiding officer of the governing body of each member district.
    
    (i)  An individual may not be listed as a candidate on the ballot for more than one director position.  If a candidate is nominated for more than one director position, the candidate must choose to be on the ballot for only one director position.
    
    (j)  The governing body of each member district shall determine its votes for director by resolution and submit them to the presiding officer of the authority before May 1 of each even-numbered year.  In casting its votes for director, the governing body of each member district may vote for only one candidate on the ballot for the director precinct in which the member district is located and for one candidate on the at-large position ballot.  For each director precinct from which a director is being appointed, the board shall count the votes, declare elected the candidate who received the greatest number of votes from member districts located within that director precinct, and submit the results before May 15 of that year to the governing body of each member district within that director precinct.  For the at-large position, the board shall count the votes, declare elected the candidate who received the greatest number of votes, and submit the results before May 15 of that year to the governing body of each member district.
    
    (k)  The board may adopt rules regarding:
    
    (1)  the manner and timing of determinations and computations required by this section;
    
    (2)  the reporting of water usage to the authority by member districts; and

    Sec. 8815.105.  ASSESSMENTS.  (a)  The board may undertake improvement projects and services that confer a special benefit on all or a definable part of the authority.  The board may impose special assessments on property in that area, including property of a local government, based on the benefit conferred by the improvement project or services, to pay all or part of the cost of the project and services.

If the board appoints a hearings examiner to conduct the hearing, after conclusion of the hearing, the hearings examiner shall file with the board a written report of the examiner's findings and conclusions.
    
    (g)  At a hearing on proposed assessments, on adjournment of the hearing, or after consideration of the hearings examiner's report, the board shall hear and rule on all objections to each proposed assessment.

    (j)  The board shall apportion the cost of an improvement project or services to be assessed against the property in the authority according to the special benefits that accrue to the property because of the improvement project or services.  The board may assess the cost only according to the number of gallons of groundwater pumped from wells within the authority that are subject to a groundwater reduction requirement imposed by the subsidence district.  The board may not assess the cost according to groundwater pumped from:
    
    (1)  a well with a casing diameter of less than five inches that serves only a single-family dwelling; or
    
    (2)  a well that is regulated by Chapter [27](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=27), Water Code.

    (1)  filed with the secretary of the board or other officer who performs the function of secretary; and
    
    (2)  open for public inspection.
    
    (o)  After notice and hearing in the manner required for an original assessment, the board may make supplemental assessments to correct omissions or mistakes in the assessment:
    
    (1)  relating to the total cost of the improvement project or services; or
    
    (2)  covering delinquencies or costs of collection.
