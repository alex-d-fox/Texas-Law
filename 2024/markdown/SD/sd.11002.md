Revenue from the tax may be used for any purpose for which ad valorem tax revenue of the district may be used.
    
    (b)  The district may not adopt a sales and use tax if as a result of the adoption of the tax the combined rate of all sales and use taxes imposed by the district and other political subdivisions of this state having territory in the district would exceed two percent at any location in the district.
    
    (c)  If the voters of the district approve the adoption of a sales and use tax at an election held on the same election date on which another political subdivision adopts a sales and use tax or approves an increase in the rate of its sales and use tax and as a result the combined rate of all sales and use taxes imposed by the district and other political subdivisions of this state having territory in the district would exceed two percent at any location in the district, the election to adopt a sales and use tax under this chapter has no effect.

    (e)  The district may not impose a sales and use tax at a rate that would cause the rate of the total sales and use taxes collected by all municipalities and other political subdivisions at a location in the district to exceed the maximum rate allowed by law.  If a political subdivision's increase to a sales and use tax rate causes the total sales and use tax rate imposed at a location in the district to exceed the maximum rate allowed by law, the district's sales and use tax rate is automatically reduced to bring the total rate imposed at that location down to a rate allowed by law.
