    (b)  Instead of issuing bonds to be registered on the surrender and cancellation of the bonds to be refunded, the district, in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the refunding bonds, may provide for the sale of the refunding bonds and the deposit of the proceeds, together with other money that may be available, in a bank at which the bonds to be refunded are payable.  In that case, the refunding bonds may be issued in an amount sufficient to pay the principal of and interest and any required redemption premium on the bonds to be refunded to any redemption date or to their maturity date, and the comptroller shall register the refunding bonds without the surrender and cancellation of the bonds to be refunded.
    
    (c)  The provisions described by Subsection (b) constitute the making of firm banking arrangements for the discharge and final payment or redemption of the bonds to be refunded or to be paid or redeemed.
