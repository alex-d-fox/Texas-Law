    (b)  A person intending to erect a structure within building setback lines must give written notice of the intention by certified mail not later than the 90th day before the date the person begins erecting the structure.
    
    (c)  Provided that the landowner was given actual notice by certified mail of the hearing to establish the setback lines, a person's failure to give notice under Subsection (b) constitutes a prima facie showing in any subsequent eminent domain proceeding instituted by the district to acquire the area within the setback lines that the person erecting the structure did so at the person's own risk with knowledge of:
    
    (1)  the fact that erecting the structure interfered with the district's setback provisions; and
    
    (2)  the district's right to remove the structure erected after the establishment of the setback lines without recovery of the value of the structure.
    
    (d)  If the district does not institute an eminent domain proceeding to acquire an area within building setback lines within 90 days after the date notice is mailed under Subsection (b), the setback lines may not affect damages in the eminent domain proceeding and the damages must be determined and paid as if the setback lines had not been established.
    
    (e)  An owner who believes that a structure the owner is about to erect may be within the required setback area by certified letter may petition the district to survey and mark the building setback lines on the ground.  If the district fails within 90 days to make the requested survey and mark the location of the setback lines on the ground or to show the location of the setback lines in another reasonable manner, the owner may erect the structure in the same manner and with the same results as if setback lines had not been established.
