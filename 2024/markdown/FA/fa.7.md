    Sec. 7.005.  INSURANCE COVERAGE NOT SPECIFICALLY AWARDED.  (a)  If in a decree of divorce or annulment the court does not specifically award all of the rights of the spouses in an insurance policy other than life insurance in effect at the time the decree is rendered, the policy remains in effect until the policy expires according to the policy's own terms.
    
    (b)  The proceeds of a valid claim under the policy are payable as follows:
    
    (1)  if the interest in the property insured was awarded solely to one former spouse by the decree, to that former spouse;
    
    (2)  if an interest in the property insured was awarded to each former spouse, to those former spouses in proportion to the interests awarded;  or

    (c)  The failure of either former spouse to change the endorsement on the policy to reflect the distribution of proceeds established by this section does not relieve the insurer of liability to pay the proceeds or any other obligation on the policy.
    
    (d)  This section does not affect the right of a former spouse to assert an ownership interest in an undivided life insurance policy, as provided by Subchapter [D](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=9.301), Chapter [9](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=9).

    (b)  If the court finds that the terms of the written agreement in a divorce or an annulment are just and right, those terms are binding on the court.  If the court approves the agreement, the court may set forth the agreement in full or incorporate the agreement by reference in the final decree.  If the court incorporates the agreement by reference in the final decree, the agreement is not required to be filed with the court or the court clerk.
    
    (c)  If the court finds that the terms of the written agreement in a divorce or annulment are not just and right, the court may request the spouses to submit a revised agreement or may set the case for a contested hearing.
