    SUBCHAPTER C.  ADJUDICATION HEARING AND REMEDIES
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 65.101.  ADJUDICATION HEARING; JUDGMENT.  (a)  A child may be found to have engaged in truant conduct only after an adjudication hearing conducted in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
    
    (b)  At the beginning of the adjudication hearing, the judge of the truancy court shall explain to the child and the child's parent, guardian, or guardian ad litem:
    
    (1)  the allegations made against the child;
    
    (2)  the nature and possible consequences of the proceedings;
    
    (3)  the child's privilege against self-incrimination;
    
    (4)  the child's right to trial and to confrontation of witnesses;
    
    (5)  the child's right to representation by an attorney if the child is not already represented; and
    
    (6)  the child's right to a jury trial.
    
    (c)  Trial is by jury unless jury is waived in accordance with Section [65.008](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=65.008).  Jury verdicts under this chapter must be unanimous.
    
    (d)  The Texas Rules of Evidence do not apply in a truancy proceeding under this chapter except:
    
    (1)  when the judge hearing the case determines that a particular rule of evidence applicable to criminal cases must be followed to ensure that the proceedings are fair to all parties; or
    
    (2)  as otherwise provided by this chapter.
    
    (e)  A child alleged to have engaged in truant conduct need not be a witness against nor otherwise incriminate himself or herself.  An extrajudicial statement of the child that was obtained in violation of the constitution of this state or the United States may not be used in an adjudication hearing.  A statement made by the child out of court is insufficient to support a finding of truant conduct unless it is corroborated wholly or partly by other evidence.
    
    (f)  At the conclusion of the adjudication hearing, the court or jury shall find whether the child has engaged in truant conduct.  The finding must be based on competent evidence admitted at the hearing.  The child shall be presumed to have not engaged in truant conduct and no finding that a child has engaged in truant conduct may be returned unless the state has proved the conduct beyond a reasonable doubt.  In all jury cases the jury will be instructed that the burden is on the state to prove that a child has engaged in truant conduct beyond a reasonable doubt.
    
    (g)  If the court or jury finds that the child did not engage in truant conduct, the court shall dismiss the case with prejudice.
    
    (h)  If the court or jury finds that the child did engage in truant conduct, the court shall proceed to issue a judgment finding the child has engaged in truant conduct and order the remedies the court finds appropriate under Section [65.103](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=65.103).  The jury is not involved in ordering remedies for a child who has been adjudicated as having engaged in truant conduct.

    (c)  After pronouncing the court's remedial actions, the court shall advise the child and the child's parent, guardian, or guardian ad litem of:
    
    (1)  the child's right to appeal, as detailed in Subchapter D; and
    
    (2)  the procedures for the sealing of the child's records under Section [65.201](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=65.201).

    (1)  attend school without unexcused absences;
    
    (2)  attend a preparatory class for the high school equivalency examination administered under Section [7.111](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=7.111), Education Code, if the court determines that the individual is unlikely to do well in a formal classroom environment due to the individual's age;
    
    (3)  if the child is at least 16 years of age, take the high school equivalency examination administered under Section [7.111](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=7.111), Education Code, if that is in the best interest of the child;

    (5)  complete not more than 50 hours of community service on a project acceptable to the court; and
    
    (6)  participate for a specified number of hours in a tutorial program covering the academic subjects in which the child is enrolled that are provided by the school the child attends.
    
    (b)  A truancy court may not order a child who has been found to have engaged in truant conduct to:
    
    (1)  attend a juvenile justice alternative education program, a boot camp, or a for-profit truancy class; or
    
    (2)  perform more than 16 hours of community service per week under this section.
    
    (c)  In addition to any other order authorized by this section, a truancy court may order the Department of Public Safety to suspend the driver's license or permit of a child who has been found to have engaged in truant conduct.  If the child does not have a driver's license or permit, the court may order the Department of Public Safety to deny the issuance of a license or permit to the child.  The period of the license or permit suspension or the order that the issuance of a license or permit be denied may not extend beyond the maximum time period that a remedial order is effective as provided by Section [65.104](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=65.104).
