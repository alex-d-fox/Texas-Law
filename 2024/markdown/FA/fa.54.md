    TITLE 3. JUVENILE JUSTICE CODE
    
      
    
    
    CHAPTER 54. JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 54.01.  DETENTION HEARING.  (a)  Except as provided by Subsection (p), if the child is not released under Section [53.02](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=53.02), a detention hearing without a jury shall be held promptly, but not later than the second working day after the child is taken into custody;  provided, however, that when a child is detained on a Friday or Saturday, then such detention hearing shall be held on the first working day after the child is taken into custody.
    
    (b)  Reasonable notice of the detention hearing, either oral or written, shall be given, stating the time, place, and purpose of the hearing.  Notice shall be given to the child and, if they can be found, to his parents, guardian, or custodian.  Prior to the commencement of the hearing, the court shall inform the parties of the child's right to counsel and to appointed counsel if they are indigent and of the child's right to remain silent with respect to any allegations of delinquent conduct, conduct indicating a need for supervision, or conduct that violates an order of probation imposed by a juvenile court.
    
    (b-1)  Unless the court finds that the appointment of counsel is not feasible due to exigent circumstances, the court shall appoint counsel within a reasonable time before the first detention hearing is held to represent the child at that hearing.
    
    (c)  At the detention hearing, the court may consider written reports from probation officers, professional court employees, guardians ad litem appointed under Section [51.11](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=51.11)(d), or professional consultants in addition to the testimony of witnesses. Prior to the detention hearing, the court shall provide the attorney for the child with access to all written matter to be considered by the court in making the detention decision.  The court may order counsel not to reveal items to the child or the child's parent, guardian, or guardian ad litem if such disclosure would materially harm the treatment and rehabilitation of the child or would substantially decrease the likelihood of receiving information from the same or similar sources in the future.
    
    (d)  A detention hearing may be held without the presence of the child's parents if the court has been unable to locate them.  If no parent or guardian is present, the court shall appoint counsel or a guardian ad litem for the child, subject to the requirements of Subsection (b-1).
    
    (e)  At the conclusion of the hearing, the court shall order the child released from detention unless it finds that:
    
    (1)  he is likely to abscond or be removed from the jurisdiction of the court;
    
    (2)  suitable supervision, care, or protection for him is not being provided by a parent, guardian, custodian, or other person;
    
    (3)  he has no parent, guardian, custodian, or other person able to return him to the court when required;
    
    (4)  he may be dangerous to himself or may threaten the safety of the public if released;  or
    
    (5)  he has previously been found to be a delinquent child or has previously been convicted of a penal offense punishable by a term in jail or prison and is likely to commit an offense if released.
    
    (f)  Unless otherwise agreed in the memorandum of understanding under Section [37.011](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.011), Education Code, a release may be conditioned on requirements reasonably necessary to insure the child's appearance at later proceedings, but the conditions of the release must be in writing and a copy furnished to the child.  In a county with a population greater than 125,000, if a child being released under this section is expelled under Section [37.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.007), Education Code, the release shall be conditioned on the child's attending a juvenile justice alternative education program pending a deferred prosecution or formal court disposition of the child's case.
    
    (g)  No statement made by the child at the detention hearing shall be admissible against the child at any other hearing.
    
    (h)  A detention order extends to the conclusion of the disposition hearing, if there is one, but in no event for more than 10 working days.  Further detention orders may be made following subsequent detention hearings.  The initial detention hearing may not be waived but subsequent detention hearings may be waived in accordance with the requirements of Section [51.09](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=51.09). Each subsequent detention order shall extend for no more than 10 working days, except that in a county that does not have a certified juvenile detention facility, as described by Section [51.12](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=51.12)(a)(3), each subsequent detention order shall extend for no more than 15 working days.
    
    (i)  A child in custody may be detained for as long as 10 days without the hearing described in Subsection (a) of this section if:
    
    (1)  a written request for shelter in detention facilities pending arrangement of transportation to his place of residence in another state or country or another county of this state is voluntarily executed by the child not later than the next working day after he was taken into custody;
    
    (2)  the request for shelter contains:
    
    (A)  a statement by the child that he voluntarily agrees to submit himself to custody and detention for a period of not longer than 10 days without a detention hearing;
    
    (B)  an allegation by the person detaining the child that the child has left his place of residence in another state or country or another county of this state, that he is in need of shelter, and that an effort is being made to arrange transportation to his place of residence;  and
    
    (C)  a statement by the person detaining the child that he has advised the child of his right to demand a detention hearing under Subsection (a) of this section;  and
    
    (3)  the request is signed by the juvenile court judge to evidence his knowledge of the fact that the child is being held in detention.
    
    (j)  The request for shelter may be revoked by the child at any time, and on such revocation, if further detention is necessary, a detention hearing shall be held not later than the next working day in accordance with Subsections (a) through (g) of this section.
    
    (k)  Notwithstanding anything in this title to the contrary, the child may sign a request for shelter without the concurrence of an adult specified in Section [51.09](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=51.09) of this code.
    
    (l)  The juvenile board may appoint a referee to conduct the detention hearing.  The referee shall be an attorney licensed to practice law in this state.  Such payment or additional payment as may be warranted for referee services shall be provided from county funds.  Before commencing the detention hearing, the referee shall inform the parties who have appeared that they are entitled to have the hearing before the juvenile court judge or a substitute judge authorized by Section [51.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=51.04)(f). If a party objects to the referee conducting the detention hearing, an authorized judge shall conduct the hearing within 24 hours.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the referee shall transmit written findings and recommendations to the juvenile court judge or substitute judge.  The juvenile court judge or substitute judge shall adopt, modify, or reject the referee's recommendations not later than the next working day after the day that the judge receives the recommendations.  Failure to act within that time results in release of the child by operation of law.  A recommendation that the child be released operates to secure the child's immediate release, subject to the power of the juvenile court judge or substitute judge to reject or modify that recommendation.  The effect of an order detaining a child shall be computed from the time of the hearing before the referee.
    
    (m)  The detention hearing required in this section may be held in the county of the designated place of detention where the child is being held even though the designated place of detention is outside the county of residence of the child or the county in which the alleged delinquent conduct, conduct indicating a need for supervision, or probation violation occurred.
    
    (n)  An attorney appointed by the court under Section [51.10](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=51.10)(c) because a determination was made under this section to detain a child who was not represented by an attorney may request on behalf of the child and is entitled to a de novo detention hearing under this section.  The attorney must make the request not later than the 10th working day after the date the attorney is appointed.  The hearing must take place not later than the second working day after the date the attorney filed a formal request with the court for a hearing.
    
    (o)  The court or referee shall find whether there is probable cause to believe that a child taken into custody without an arrest warrant or a directive to apprehend has engaged in delinquent conduct, conduct indicating a need for supervision, or conduct that violates an order of probation imposed by a juvenile court.  The court or referee must make the finding within 48 hours, including weekends and holidays, of the time the child was taken into custody.  The court or referee may make the finding on any reasonably reliable information without regard to admissibility of that information under the Texas Rules of Evidence.  A finding of probable cause is required to detain a child after the 48th hour after the time the child was taken into custody.  If a court or referee finds probable cause, additional findings of probable cause are not required in the same cause to authorize further detention.
    
    (p)  If a child is detained in a county jail or other facility as provided by Section [51.12](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=51.12)(l) and the child is not released under Section [53.02](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=53.02)(f), a detention hearing without a jury shall be held promptly, but not later than the 24th hour, excluding weekends and holidays, after the time the child is taken into custody.
    
    (q)  If a child has not been released under Section [53.02](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=53.02) or this section and a petition has not been filed under Section [53.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=53.04) or [54.05](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=54.05) concerning the child, the court shall order the child released from detention not later than:
    
    (1)  the 30th working day after the date the initial detention hearing is held, if the child is alleged to have engaged in conduct constituting a capital felony, an aggravated controlled substance felony, or a felony of the first degree;  or
    
    (2)  the 15th working day after the date the initial detention hearing is held, if the child is alleged to have engaged in conduct constituting an offense other than an offense listed in Subdivision (1) or conduct that violates an order of probation imposed by a juvenile court.
    
    (q-1)  The juvenile board may impose an earlier deadline than the specified deadlines for filing petitions under Subsection (q) and may specify the consequences of not filing a petition by the deadline the juvenile board has established.  The juvenile board may authorize but not require the juvenile court to release a respondent from detention for failure of the prosecutor to file a petition by the juvenile board's deadline.
    
    (r)  On the conditional release of a child from detention by judicial order under Subsection (f), the court, referee, or detention magistrate may order that the child's parent, guardian, or custodian present in court at the detention hearing engage in acts or omissions specified by the court, referee, or detention magistrate that will assist the child in complying with the conditions of release.  The order must be in writing and a copy furnished to the parent, guardian, or custodian.  An order entered under this subsection may be enforced as provided by Chapter [61](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=61).

    Sec. 54.02.  WAIVER OF JURISDICTION AND DISCRETIONARY TRANSFER TO CRIMINAL COURT.  (a)  The juvenile court may waive its exclusive original jurisdiction and transfer a child to the appropriate district court or criminal district court for criminal proceedings if:
    
    (1)  the child is alleged to have violated a penal law of the grade of felony;
    
    (2)  the child was:
    
    (A)  14 years of age or older at the time he is alleged to have committed the offense, if the offense is a capital felony, an aggravated controlled substance felony, or a felony of the first degree, and no adjudication hearing has been conducted concerning that offense;  or
    
    (B)  15 years of age or older at the time the child is alleged to have committed the offense, if the offense is a felony of the second or third degree or a state jail felony, and no adjudication hearing has been conducted concerning that offense;  and
    
    (3)  after a full investigation and a hearing, the juvenile court determines that there is probable cause to believe that the child before the court committed the offense alleged and that because of the seriousness of the offense alleged or the background of the child the welfare of the community requires criminal proceedings.
    
    (b)  The petition and notice requirements of Sections [53.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=53.04), [53.05](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=53.05), [53.06](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=53.06), and [53.07](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=53.07) of this code must be satisfied, and the summons must state that the hearing is for the purpose of considering discretionary transfer to criminal court.
    
    (c)  The juvenile court shall conduct a hearing without a jury to consider transfer of the child for criminal proceedings.
    
    (d)  Prior to the hearing, the juvenile court shall order and obtain a complete diagnostic study, social evaluation, and full investigation of the child, his circumstances, and the circumstances of the alleged offense.
    
    (e)  At the transfer hearing the court may consider written reports from probation officers, professional court employees, guardians ad litem appointed under Section [51.11](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=51.11)(d), or professional consultants in addition to the testimony of witnesses.  At least five days prior to the transfer hearing, the court shall provide the attorney for the child and the prosecuting attorney with access to all written matter to be considered by the court in making the transfer decision.  The court may order counsel not to reveal items to the child or the child's parent, guardian, or guardian ad litem if such disclosure would materially harm the treatment and rehabilitation of the child or would substantially decrease the likelihood of receiving information from the same or similar sources in the future.
    
    (f)  In making the determination required by Subsection (a) of this section, the court shall consider, among other matters:
    
    (1)  whether the alleged offense was against person or property, with greater weight in favor of transfer given to offenses against the person;
    
    (2)  the sophistication and maturity of the child;
    
    (3)  the record and previous history of the child;  and
    
    (4)  the prospects of adequate protection of the public and the likelihood of the rehabilitation of the child by use of procedures, services, and facilities currently available to the juvenile court.
    
    (g)  If the petition alleges multiple offenses that constitute more than one criminal transaction, the juvenile court shall either retain or transfer all offenses relating to a single transaction.  Except as provided by Subsection (g-1), a child is not subject to criminal prosecution at any time for any offense arising out of a criminal transaction for which the juvenile court retains jurisdiction.
    
    (g-1)  A child may be subject to criminal prosecution for an offense committed under Chapter [19](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=19) or Section [49.08](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=49.08), Penal Code, if:
    
    (1)  the offense arises out of a criminal transaction for which the juvenile court retained jurisdiction over other offenses relating to the criminal transaction; and
    
    (2)  on or before the date the juvenile court retained jurisdiction, one or more of the elements of the offense under Chapter [19](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=19) or Section [49.08](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=49.08), Penal Code, had not occurred.
    
    (h)  If the juvenile court waives jurisdiction, it shall state specifically in the order its reasons for waiver and certify its action, including the written order and findings of the court, and shall transfer the person to the appropriate court for criminal proceedings and cause the results of the diagnostic study of the person ordered under Subsection (d), including psychological information, to be transferred to the appropriate criminal prosecutor.  On transfer of the person for criminal proceedings, the person shall be dealt with as an adult and in accordance with the Code of Criminal Procedure, except that if detention in a certified juvenile detention facility is authorized under Section [152.0015](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HR&Value=152.0015), Human Resources Code, the juvenile court may order the person to be detained in the facility pending trial or until the criminal court enters an order under Article [4.19](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=4.19), Code of Criminal Procedure.  A transfer of custody made under this subsection is an arrest.
    
    (h-1)  If the juvenile court orders a person detained in a certified juvenile detention facility under Subsection (h), the juvenile court shall set or deny bond for the person as required by the Code of Criminal Procedure and other law applicable to the pretrial detention of adults accused of criminal offenses.
    
    (i)  A waiver under this section is a waiver of jurisdiction over the child and the criminal court may not remand the child to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.
    
    (j)  The juvenile court may waive its exclusive original jurisdiction and transfer a person to the appropriate district court or criminal district court for criminal proceedings if:
    
    (1)  the person is 18 years of age or older;
    
    (2)  the person was:
    
    (A)  10 years of age or older and under 17 years of age at the time the person is alleged to have committed a capital felony or an offense under Section [19.02](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=19.02), Penal Code;
    
    (B)  14 years of age or older and under 17 years of age at the time the person is alleged to have committed an aggravated controlled substance felony or a felony of the first degree other than an offense under Section [19.02](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=19.02), Penal Code;  or
    
    (C)  15 years of age or older and under 17 years of age at the time the person is alleged to have committed a felony of the second or third degree or a state jail felony;
    
    (3)  no adjudication concerning the alleged offense has been made or no adjudication hearing concerning the offense has been conducted;
    
    (4)  the juvenile court finds from a preponderance of the evidence that:
    
    (A)  for a reason beyond the control of the state it was not practicable to proceed in juvenile court before the 18th birthday of the person;  or
    
    (B)  after due diligence of the state it was not practicable to proceed in juvenile court before the 18th birthday of the person because:
    
    (i)  the state did not have probable cause to proceed in juvenile court and new evidence has been found since the 18th birthday of the person;
    
    (ii)  the person could not be found;  or
    
    (iii)  a previous transfer order was reversed by an appellate court or set aside by a district court;  and
    
    (5)  the juvenile court determines that there is probable cause to believe that the child before the court committed the offense alleged.
    
    (k)  The petition and notice requirements of Sections [53.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=53.04), [53.05](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=53.05), [53.06](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=53.06), and [53.07](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=53.07) of this code must be satisfied, and the summons must state that the hearing is for the purpose of considering waiver of jurisdiction under Subsection (j).  The person's parent, custodian, guardian, or guardian ad litem is not considered a party to a proceeding under Subsection (j) and it is not necessary to provide the parent, custodian, guardian, or guardian ad litem with notice.
    
    (l)  The juvenile court shall conduct a hearing without a jury to consider waiver of jurisdiction under Subsection (j).  Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, a waiver of jurisdiction under Subsection (j) may be made without the necessity of conducting the diagnostic study or complying with the requirements of discretionary transfer proceedings under Subsection (d).  If requested by the attorney for the person at least 10 days before the transfer hearing, the court shall order that the person be examined pursuant to Section [51.20](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=51.20)(a) and that the results of the examination be provided to the attorney for the person and the attorney for the state at least five days before the transfer hearing.
    
    (m)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the juvenile court shall waive its exclusive original jurisdiction and transfer a child to the appropriate district court or criminal court for criminal proceedings if:
    
    (1)  the child has previously been transferred to a district court or criminal district court for criminal proceedings under this section, unless:
    
    (A)  the child was not indicted in the matter transferred by the grand jury;
    
    (B)  the child was found not guilty in the matter transferred;
    
    (C)  the matter transferred was dismissed with prejudice;  or
    
    (D)  the child was convicted in the matter transferred, the conviction was reversed on appeal, and the appeal is final;  and
    
    (2)  the child is alleged to have violated a penal law of the grade of felony.
    
    (n)  A mandatory transfer under Subsection (m) may be made without conducting the study required in discretionary transfer proceedings by Subsection (d).  The requirements of Subsection (b) that the summons state that the purpose of the hearing is to consider discretionary transfer to criminal court does not apply to a transfer proceeding under Subsection (m).  In a proceeding under Subsection (m), it is sufficient that the summons provide fair notice that the purpose of the hearing is to consider mandatory transfer to criminal court.
    
    (o)  If a respondent is taken into custody for possible discretionary transfer proceedings under Subsection (j), the juvenile court shall hold a detention hearing in the same manner as provided by Section [54.01](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=54.01), except that the court shall order the respondent released unless it finds that the respondent:
    
    (1)  is likely to abscond or be removed from the jurisdiction of the court;
    
    (2)  may be dangerous to himself or herself or may threaten the safety of the public if released;  or
    
    (3)  has previously been found to be a delinquent child or has previously been convicted of a penal offense punishable by a term of jail or prison and is likely to commit an offense if released.
    
    (p)  If the juvenile court does not order a respondent released under Subsection (o), the court shall, pending the conclusion of the discretionary transfer hearing, order that the respondent be detained in:
    
    (1)  a certified juvenile detention facility as provided by Subsection (q);  or
    
    (2)  an appropriate county facility for the detention of adults accused of criminal offenses.
    
    (q)  The detention of a respondent in a certified juvenile detention facility must comply with the detention requirements under this title, except that, to the extent practicable, the person shall be kept separate from children detained in the same facility.
    
    (r)  If the juvenile court orders a respondent detained in a county facility under Subsection (p), the county sheriff shall take custody of the respondent under the juvenile court's order.  The juvenile court shall set or deny bond for the respondent as required by the Code of Criminal Procedure and other law applicable to the pretrial detention of adults accused of criminal offenses.
    
    (s)  If a child is transferred to criminal court under this section, only the petition for discretionary transfer, the order of transfer, and the order of commitment, if any, are a part of the district clerk's public record.

    Sec. 54.021.  SERVICES PROVIDED TO CHILD IN DETENTION FACILITY PENDING CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.  (a) A child ordered to be detained in a juvenile detention facility under Section [54.02](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=54.02)(h) shall, to the extent practicable, be provided education, programming, and other services consistent with the minimum standards adopted by the Texas Juvenile Justice Board for juvenile detention facilities under Section [221.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HR&Value=221.002), Human Resources Code.

    Added by Acts 2023, 88th Leg., R.S., Ch. 456 (H.B. [5195](http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/88R/billtext/html/HB05195F.HTM)), Sec. 1, eff. September 1, 2023.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 54.03.  ADJUDICATION HEARING.  (a)  A child may be found to have engaged in delinquent conduct or conduct indicating a need for supervision only after an adjudication hearing conducted in accordance with the provisions of this section.
    
    (b)  At the beginning of the adjudication hearing, the juvenile court judge shall explain to the child and his parent, guardian, or guardian ad litem:
    
    (1)  the allegations made against the child;
    
    (2)  the nature and possible consequences of the proceedings, including the law relating to the admissibility of the record of a juvenile court adjudication in a criminal proceeding;
    
    (3)  the child's privilege against self-incrimination;
    
    (4)  the child's right to trial and to confrontation of witnesses;
    
    (5)  the child's right to representation by an attorney if he is not already represented;  and
    
    (6)  the child's right to trial by jury.
    
    (c)  Trial shall be by jury unless jury is waived in accordance with Section [51.09](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=51.09). If the hearing is on a petition that has been approved by the grand jury under Section [53.045](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=53.045), the jury must consist of 12 persons and be selected in accordance with the requirements in criminal cases.  If the hearing is on a petition that alleges conduct that violates a penal law of this state of the grade of misdemeanor, the jury must consist of the number of persons required by Article [33.01](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=33.01)(b), Code of Criminal Procedure.  Jury verdicts under this title must be unanimous.
    
    (d)  Except as provided by Section [54.031](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=54.031), only material, relevant, and competent evidence in accordance with the Texas Rules of Evidence applicable to criminal cases and Chapter [38](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=38), Code of Criminal Procedure, may be considered in the adjudication hearing.  Except in a detention or discretionary transfer hearing, a social history report or social service file shall not be viewed by the court before the adjudication decision and shall not be viewed by the jury at any time.
    
    (e)  A child alleged to have engaged in delinquent conduct or conduct indicating a need for supervision need not be a witness against nor otherwise incriminate himself.  An extrajudicial statement which was obtained without fulfilling the requirements of this title or of the constitution of this state or the United States, may not be used in an adjudication hearing.  A statement made by the child out of court is insufficient to support a finding of delinquent conduct or conduct indicating a need for supervision unless it is corroborated in whole or in part by other evidence.  An adjudication of delinquent conduct or conduct indicating a need for supervision cannot be had upon the testimony of an accomplice unless corroborated by other evidence tending to connect the child with the alleged delinquent conduct or conduct indicating a need for supervision;  and the corroboration is not sufficient if it merely shows the commission of the alleged conduct.  Evidence illegally seized or obtained is inadmissible in an adjudication hearing.
    
    (f)  At the conclusion of the adjudication hearing, the court or jury shall find whether or not the child has engaged in delinquent conduct or conduct indicating a need for supervision.  The finding must be based on competent evidence admitted at the hearing.  The child shall be presumed to be innocent of the charges against the child and no finding that a child has engaged in delinquent conduct or conduct indicating a need for supervision may be returned unless the state has proved such beyond a reasonable doubt.  In all jury cases the jury will be instructed that the burden is on the state to prove that a child has engaged in delinquent conduct or is in need of supervision beyond a reasonable doubt.  A child may be adjudicated as having engaged in conduct constituting a lesser included offense as provided by Articles [37.08](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=37.08) and [37.09](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=37.09), Code of Criminal Procedure.
    
    (g)  If the court or jury finds that the child did not engage in delinquent conduct or conduct indicating a need for supervision, the court shall dismiss the case with prejudice.
    
    (h)  If the finding is that the child did engage in delinquent conduct or conduct indicating a need for supervision, the court or jury shall state which of the allegations in the petition were found to be established by the evidence.  The court shall also set a date and time for the disposition hearing.
    
    (i)  In order to preserve for appellate or collateral review the failure of the court to provide the child the explanation required by Subsection (b), the attorney for the child must comply with Rule 33.1, Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure, before testimony begins or, if the adjudication is uncontested, before the child pleads to the petition or agrees to a stipulation of evidence.
    
    (j)  When the state and the child agree to the disposition of the case, in whole or in part, the prosecuting attorney shall inform the court of the agreement between the state and the child.  The court shall inform the child that the court is not required to accept the agreement.  The court may delay a decision on whether to accept the agreement until after reviewing a report filed under Section [54.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=54.04)(b).  If the court decides not to accept the agreement, the court shall inform the child of the court's decision and give the child an opportunity to withdraw the plea or stipulation of evidence.  If the court rejects the agreement, no document, testimony, or other evidence placed before the court that relates to the rejected agreement may be considered by the court in a subsequent hearing in the case.  A statement made by the child before the court's rejection of the agreement to a person writing a report to be filed under Section [54.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=54.04)(b) may not be admitted into evidence in a subsequent hearing in the case.  If the court accepts the agreement, the court shall make a disposition in accordance with the terms of the agreement between the state and the child.

    Sec. 54.031.  HEARSAY STATEMENT OF CERTAIN ABUSE VICTIMS.  (a)  This section applies to a hearing under this title in which a child is alleged to be a delinquent child on the basis of a violation of any of the following provisions of the Penal Code, if a child 12 years of age or younger or a person with a disability is the alleged victim of the violation:

    (2)  were made to the first person, 18 years of age or older, to whom the child or person with a disability made a statement about the violation.
    
    (c)  A statement that meets the requirements of Subsection (b) is not inadmissible because of the hearsay rule if:
    
    (1)  on or before the 14th day before the date the hearing begins, the party intending to offer the statement:
    
    (A)  notifies each other party of its intention to do so;
    
    (B)  provides each other party with the name of the witness through whom it intends to offer the statement; and
    
    (C)  provides each other party with a written summary of the statement;

    (3)  the child or person with a disability who is the alleged victim testifies or is available to testify at the hearing in court or in any other manner provided by law.
    
    (d)  In this section, "person with a disability" means a person 13 years of age or older who because of age or physical or mental disease, disability, or injury is substantially unable to protect the person's self from harm or to provide food, shelter, or medical care for the person's self.

    (c)  No disposition may be made under this section unless the child is in need of rehabilitation or the protection of the public or the child requires that disposition be made.  If the court or jury does not so find, the court shall dismiss the child and enter a final judgment without any disposition.  No disposition placing the child on probation outside the child's home may be made under this section unless the court or jury finds that the child, in the child's home, cannot be provided the quality of care and level of support and supervision that the child needs to meet the conditions of the probation.

    (3)  if the court or jury found at the conclusion of the adjudication hearing that the child engaged in delinquent conduct that included a violation of a penal law listed in Section [53.045](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=53.045)(a) and if the petition was approved by the grand jury under Section [53.045](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=53.045), the court or jury may sentence the child to commitment in the Texas Juvenile Justice Department or a post-adjudication secure correctional facility under Section 54.04011(c)(2) with a possible transfer to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice for a term of:
    
    (A)  not more than 40 years if the conduct constitutes:

    (e)  The Texas Juvenile Justice Department shall accept a person properly committed to it by a juvenile court even though the person may be 17 years of age or older at the time of commitment.

    (g)  If the court orders a disposition under Subsection (d)(3) or (m) and there is an affirmative finding that the defendant used or exhibited a deadly weapon during the commission of the conduct or during immediate flight from commission of the conduct, the court shall enter the finding in the order.  If there is an affirmative finding that the deadly weapon was a firearm, the court shall enter that finding in the order.
    
    (h)  At the conclusion of the dispositional hearing, the court shall inform the child of:

    (2)  may approve an administrative body to conduct permanency hearings pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Section 675 if required during the placement or commitment of the child.

    (1)  shall require that the child's thumbprint be affixed or attached to the order;  and
    
    (2)  may require that a photograph of the child be attached to the order.
    
    (k)  Except as provided by Subsection (m), the period to which a court or jury may sentence a person to commitment to the Texas Juvenile Justice Department with a transfer to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice under Subsection (d)(3) applies without regard to whether the person has previously been adjudicated as having engaged in delinquent conduct.

    Sec. 54.041.  ORDERS AFFECTING PARENTS AND OTHERS.
    
    (a)  When a child has been found to have engaged in delinquent conduct or conduct indicating a need for supervision and the juvenile court has made a finding that the child is in need of rehabilitation or that the protection of the public or the child requires that disposition be made, the juvenile court, on notice by any reasonable method to all persons affected, may:
    
    (1)  order any person found by the juvenile court to have, by a wilful act or omission, contributed to, caused, or encouraged the child's delinquent conduct or conduct indicating a need for supervision to do any act that the juvenile court determines to be reasonable and necessary for the welfare of the child or to refrain from doing any act that the juvenile court determines to be injurious to the welfare of the child;
    
    (2)  enjoin all contact between the child and a person who is found to be a contributing cause of the child's delinquent conduct or conduct indicating a need for supervision; or
    
    (3)  after notice and a hearing of all persons affected order any person living in the same household with the child to participate in social or psychological counseling to assist in the rehabilitation of the child and to strengthen the child's family environment.
    
    (b)  If a child is found to have engaged in delinquent conduct or conduct indicating a need for supervision arising from the commission of an offense in which property damage or loss or personal injury occurred, the juvenile court, on notice to all persons affected and on hearing, may order the child or a parent to make full or partial restitution to the victim of the offense.  The program of restitution must promote the rehabilitation of the child, be appropriate to the age and physical, emotional, and mental abilities of the child, and not conflict with the child's schooling.  When practicable and subject to court supervision, the court may approve a restitution program based on a settlement between the child and the victim of the offense.  An order under this subsection may provide for periodic payments by the child or a parent of the child for the period specified in the order but except as provided by Subsection (h), that period may not extend past the date of the 18th birthday of the child or past the date the child is no longer enrolled in an accredited secondary school in a program leading toward a high school diploma, whichever date is later.
    
    (c)  Restitution under this section is cumulative of any other remedy allowed by law and may be used in addition to other remedies;  except that a victim of an offense is not entitled to receive more than actual damages under a juvenile court order.
    
    (d)  A person subject to an order proposed under Subsection (a) of this section is entitled to a hearing on the order before the order is entered by the court.
    
    (e)  An order made under this section may be enforced as provided by Section [54.07](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=54.07) of this code.

The liability of the child's parent for restitution may not be extended by transfer to a district court for supervision.

    Sec. 54.051.  TRANSFER OF DETERMINATE SENTENCE PROBATION TO APPROPRIATE DISTRICT COURT.  (a)  On motion of the state concerning a child who is placed on probation under Section [54.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=54.04)(q) for a period, including any extension ordered under Section [54.05](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=54.05), that will continue after the child's 19th birthday, the juvenile court shall hold a hearing to determine whether to transfer the child to an appropriate district court or discharge the child from the sentence of probation.
    
    (b)  The hearing must be conducted before the person's 19th birthday, or before the person's 18th birthday if the offense for which the person was placed on probation occurred before September 1, 2011, and must be conducted in the same manner as a hearing to modify disposition under Section [54.05](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=54.05).
    
    (c)  If, after a hearing, the court determines to discharge the child, the court shall specify a date on or before the child's 19th birthday to discharge the child from the sentence of probation.
    
    (d)  If, after a hearing, the court determines to transfer the child, the court shall transfer the child to an appropriate district court on the child's 19th birthday.
    
    (d-1)  After a transfer to district court under Subsection (d), only the petition, the grand jury approval, the judgment concerning the conduct for which the person was placed on determinate sentence probation, and the transfer order are a part of the district clerk's public record.
    
    (e)  A district court that exercises jurisdiction over a person transferred under Subsection (d) shall place the person on community supervision under Chapter [42A](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=42A), Code of Criminal Procedure, for the remainder of the person's probationary period and under conditions consistent with those ordered by the juvenile court.
    
    (e-1)  The restrictions on a judge placing a defendant on community supervision imposed by Article [42A.054](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=42A.054), Code of Criminal Procedure, do not apply to a case transferred from the juvenile court. The minimum period of community supervision imposed by Article [42A.053](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=42A.053)(d), Code of Criminal Procedure, does not apply to a case transferred from the juvenile court.
    
    (e-2)  If a person who is placed on community supervision under this section violates a condition of that supervision or if the person violated a condition of probation ordered under Section [54.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=54.04)(q) and that probation violation was not discovered by the state before the person's 19th birthday, the district court shall dispose of the violation of community supervision or probation, as appropriate, in the same manner as if the court had originally exercised jurisdiction over the case.  If the judge revokes community supervision, the judge may reduce the prison sentence to any length without regard to the minimum term imposed by Article [42A.755](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=42A.755)(a), Code of Criminal Procedure.
    
    (e-3)  The time that a person serves on probation ordered under Section [54.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=54.04)(q) is the same as time served on community supervision ordered under this section for purposes of determining the person's eligibility for early discharge from community supervision under Article [42A.701](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=42A.701), Code of Criminal Procedure.
    
    (f)  The juvenile court may transfer a child to an appropriate district court as provided by this section without a showing that the child violated a condition of probation ordered under Section [54.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=54.04)(q).
    
    (g)  If the juvenile court places the child on probation for an offense for which registration as a sex offender is required by Chapter [62](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=62), Code of Criminal Procedure, and defers the registration requirement until completion of treatment for the sex offense under Subchapter [H](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=62.351), Chapter [62](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=62), Code of Criminal Procedure, the authority under that article to reexamine the need for registration on completion of treatment is transferred to the court to which probation is transferred.
    
    (h)  If the juvenile court places the child on probation for an offense for which registration as a sex offender is required by Chapter [62](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=62), Code of Criminal Procedure, and the child registers, the authority of the court to excuse further compliance with the registration requirement under Subchapter [H](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=62.351), Chapter [62](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=62), Code of Criminal Procedure, is transferred to the court to which probation is transferred.
    
    (i)  If the juvenile court exercises jurisdiction over a person who is 18 or 19 years of age or older, as applicable, under Section [51.041](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=51.041) or [51.0412](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=51.0412), the court or jury may, if the person is otherwise eligible, place the person on probation under Section [54.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=54.04)(q).  The juvenile court shall set the conditions of probation and immediately transfer supervision of the person to the appropriate court exercising criminal jurisdiction under Subsection (e).

    (c)  If a child appeals the child's adjudication and is retained in a secure detention facility pending the appeal, the judge of the court in which the child was adjudicated shall give the child credit on the child's sentence for the time spent by the child in a secure detention facility pending disposition of the child's appeal.  The court shall endorse on both the commitment and the mandate from the appellate court all credit given the child under this subsection.

    (1)  the parties have been informed by the referee or associate judge that they are entitled to have the hearing before the juvenile court judge; and
    
    (2)  after each party is given an opportunity to object, no party objects to holding the hearing before the referee or associate judge.
    
    (b)  The determination under Section [53.02](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=53.02)(f) whether to release a child may be made by a referee appointed in accordance with Section [51.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=51.04)(g) if:
    
    (1)  the child has been informed by the referee that the child is entitled to have the determination made by the juvenile court judge or a substitute judge authorized by Section [51.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=51.04)(f);  or
    
    (2)  the child and the attorney for the child have in accordance with Section [51.09](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=51.09) waived the right to have the determination made by the juvenile court judge or a substitute judge.
    
    (c)  If a child objects to a referee making the determination under Section [53.02](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=53.02)(f), the juvenile court judge or a substitute judge authorized by Section [51.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=51.04)(f) shall make the determination.
    
    (d)  At the conclusion of the hearing or immediately after making the determination, the referee shall transmit written findings and recommendations to the juvenile court judge.  The juvenile court judge shall adopt, modify, or reject the referee's recommendations not later than the next working day after the day that the judge receives the recommendations.  Failure to act within that time results in release of the child by operation of law and a recommendation that the child be released operates to secure the child's immediate release subject to the power of the juvenile court judge to modify or reject that recommendation.
    
    (e)  Except as provided by Subsection (f), the hearings provided by Sections [54.03](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=54.03), [54.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=54.04), and [54.05](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=54.05) may not be held before a referee if the grand jury has approved of the petition and the child is subject to a determinate sentence.
    
    (f)  When the state and a child who is subject to a determinate sentence agree to the disposition of the case, wholly or partly, a referee or associate judge may hold a hearing for the purpose of allowing the child to enter a plea or stipulation of evidence.  After the hearing under this subsection, the referee or associate judge shall transmit the referee's or associate judge's written findings and recommendations regarding the plea or stipulation of evidence to the juvenile court judge for consideration.  The juvenile court judge may accept or reject the plea or stipulation of evidence in accordance with Section [54.03](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=54.03)(j).
