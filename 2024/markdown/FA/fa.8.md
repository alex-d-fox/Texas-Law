    (d)  A loss of employment or circumstances that render a former spouse unable to provide for the spouse's minimum reasonable needs by reason of incapacitating physical or mental disability that occur after the divorce or annulment are not grounds for the institution of spousal maintenance for the benefit of the former spouse.

    (b)  On the suit to enforce by an obligee, the court may render judgment against a defaulting party for the amount of arrearages after notice by service of citation, answer, if any, and a hearing finding that the defaulting party has failed or refused to comply with the terms of the order.  The judgment may be enforced by any means available for the enforcement of judgment for debts, including by an order or writ of withholding and a maintenance qualified domestic relations order under Subchapter H.
    
    (c)  It is an affirmative defense to an allegation of contempt of court or the violation of a condition of probation requiring payment of court-ordered maintenance that the obligor:
    
    (1)  lacked the ability to provide maintenance in the amount ordered;
    
    (2)  lacked property that could be sold, mortgaged, or otherwise pledged to raise the funds needed;
    
    (3)  attempted unsuccessfully to borrow the needed funds;  and
    
    (4)  did not know of a source from which the money could have been borrowed or otherwise legally obtained.
    
    (d)  The issue of the existence of an affirmative defense does not arise until pleaded.  An obligor must prove the affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence.

    (b)  An obligor may file a suit to recover overpaid maintenance under Subsection (a).  If the court finds that the obligee failed to return overpaid maintenance under Subsection (a), the court shall order the obligee to pay the obligor's attorney's fees and all court costs in addition to the amount of the overpaid maintenance.
