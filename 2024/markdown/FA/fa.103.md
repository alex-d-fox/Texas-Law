    Sec. 103.001.  VENUE FOR ORIGINAL SUIT.  (a)  Except as otherwise provided by this title, an original suit shall be filed in the county where the child resides, unless:
    
    (1)  another court has continuing exclusive jurisdiction under Chapter [155](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=155);  or

Except as provided by Section [155.201](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=155.201), a court that has continuing exclusive jurisdiction is not required to transfer the suit affecting the parent-child relationship to the court in which the adoption suit is filed.

    (1)  if a guardian of the person has been appointed by order of a county or probate court and a managing conservator has not been appointed, the child resides in the county where the guardian of the person resides;
    
    (2)  if the parents of the child do not reside in the same county and if a managing conservator, custodian, or guardian of the person has not been appointed, the child resides in the county where the parent having actual care, control, and possession of the child resides;
    
    (3)  if the child is in the care and control of an adult other than a parent and a managing conservator, custodian, or guardian of the person has not been appointed, the child resides where the adult having actual care, control, and possession of the child resides;
    
    (4)  if the child is in the actual care, control, and possession of an adult other than a parent and the whereabouts of the parent and the guardian of the person is unknown, the child resides where the adult having actual possession, care, and control of the child resides;
    
    (5)  if the person whose residence would otherwise determine venue has left the child in the care and control of the adult, the child resides where that adult resides;
    
    (6)  if a guardian or custodian of the child has been appointed by order of a court of another state or country, the child resides in the county where the guardian or custodian resides if that person resides in this state;  or
    
    (7)  if it appears that the child is not under the actual care, control, and possession of an adult, the child resides where the child is found.
