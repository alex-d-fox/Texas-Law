    SUBCHAPTER B. PUBLIC POLICY
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 1.101.  EVERY MARRIAGE PRESUMED VALID.  In order to promote the public health and welfare and to provide the necessary records, this code specifies detailed rules to be followed in establishing the marriage relationship.  However, in order to provide stability for those entering into the marriage relationship in good faith and to provide for an orderly determination of parentage and security for the children of the relationship, it is the policy of this state to preserve and uphold each marriage against claims of invalidity unless a strong reason exists for holding the marriage void or voidable.  Therefore, every marriage entered into in this state is presumed to be valid unless expressly made void by Chapter [6](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=6) or unless expressly made voidable by Chapter [6](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=6) and annulled as provided by that chapter.
