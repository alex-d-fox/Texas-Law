    (f)  In a suit for termination of the parent-child relationship filed by the Department of Family and Protective Services, the court may not order termination of the parent-child relationship under Subsection (b)(1) unless the court finds by clear and convincing evidence and describes in writing with specificity in a separate section of the order that:
    
    (1)  the department made reasonable efforts to return the child to the parent before commencement of a trial on the merits and despite those reasonable efforts, a continuing danger remains in the home that prevents the return of the child to the parent; or
    
    (2)  reasonable efforts to return the child to the parent, including the requirement for the department to provide a family service plan to the parent, have been waived under Section 262.2015.
    
    (g)  In a suit for termination of the parent-child relationship filed by the Department of Family and Protective Services in which the department made reasonable efforts to return the child to the child's home but a continuing danger in the home prevented the child's return, the court shall include in a separate section of its order written findings describing with specificity the reasonable efforts the department made to return the child to the child's home.

    (b)  If the petition designates the Department of Family and Protective Services as managing conservator, the department shall be given service of citation.  The court shall notify the department if the court appoints the department as the managing conservator of the child.
    
    (c)  Subject to Subsection (d), a man may file a suit for termination of the parent-child relationship between the man and a child if, without obtaining genetic testing, the man signed an acknowledgment of paternity of the child in accordance with Subchapter [D](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=160.301), Chapter [160](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=160), or was adjudicated to be the father of the child in a previous proceeding under this title in which genetic testing did not occur.  The petition must be verified and must allege facts showing that the petitioner:
    
    (1)  is not the child's genetic father; and
    
    (2)  signed the acknowledgment of paternity or failed to contest parentage in the previous proceeding because of the mistaken belief, at the time the acknowledgment was signed or on the date the court order in the previous proceeding was rendered, that he was the child's genetic father based on misrepresentations that led him to that conclusion.
    
    (d)  A man may not file a petition under Subsection (c) if:
    
    (1)  the man is the child's adoptive father;
    
    (2)  the child was conceived by assisted reproduction and the man consented to assisted reproduction by his wife under Subchapter [H](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=160.701), Chapter [160](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=160); or
    
    (3)  the man is the intended father of the child under a gestational agreement validated by a court under Subchapter [I](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=160.751), Chapter [160](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=160).
    
    (e)  A petition under Subsection (c) must be filed not later than the second anniversary of the date on which the petitioner becomes aware of the facts alleged in the petition indicating that the petitioner is not the child's genetic father.
    
    (e-1)  Expired.
    
    (f)  In a proceeding initiated under Subsection (c), the court shall hold a pretrial hearing to determine whether the petitioner has established a meritorious prima facie case for termination of the parent-child relationship.  If a meritorious prima facie claim is established, the court shall order the petitioner and the child to submit to genetic testing under Subchapter [F](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=160.501), Chapter [160](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=160).
    
    (g)  If the results of genetic testing ordered under Subsection (f) identify the petitioner as the child's genetic father under the standards prescribed by Section [160.505](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=160.505) and the results of any further testing requested by the petitioner and ordered by the court under Subchapter [F](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=160.501), Chapter [160](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=160), do not exclude the petitioner as the child's genetic father, the court shall deny the petitioner's request for termination of the parent-child relationship.
    
    (h)  If the results of genetic testing ordered under Subsection (f) exclude the petitioner as the child's genetic father, the court shall render an order terminating the parent-child relationship.
    
    (i)  An order under Subsection (h) terminating the parent-child relationship ends the petitioner's obligation for future support of the child as of the date the order is rendered, as well as the obligation to pay interest that accrues after that date on the basis of a child support arrearage or money judgment for a child support arrearage existing on that date.  The order does not affect the petitioner's obligations for support of the child incurred before that date.  Those obligations are enforceable until satisfied by any means available for the enforcement of child support other than contempt.
    
    (j)  An order under Subsection (h) terminating the parent-child relationship does not preclude:
    
    (1)  the initiation of a proceeding under Chapter [160](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=160) to adjudicate whether another man is the child's parent; or
    
    (2)  if the other man subject to a proceeding under Subdivision (1) is adjudicated as the child's parent, the rendition of an order requiring that man to pay child support for the child under Chapter [154](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=154), subject to Subsection (k).
    
    (k)  Notwithstanding Section [154.131](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=154.131), an order described by Subsection (j)(2) may not require the other man to pay retroactive child support for any period preceding the date on which the order under Subsection (h) terminated the parent-child relationship between the child and the man seeking termination under this section.
    
    (l)  At any time before the court renders an order terminating the parent-child relationship under Subsection (h), the petitioner may request that the court also order periods of possession of or access to the child by the petitioner following termination of the parent-child relationship.  If requested, the court may order periods of possession of or access to the child only if the court determines that denial of periods of possession of or access to the child would significantly impair the child's physical health or emotional well-being.
    
    (m)  The court may include provisions in an order under Subsection (l) that require:
    
    (1)  the child or any party to the proceeding to participate in counseling with a mental health professional who:
    
    (A)  has a background in family therapy; and
    
    (B)  holds a professional license that requires the person to possess at least a master's degree; and
    
    (2)  any party to pay the costs of the counseling described by Subdivision (1).
    
    (n)  Notwithstanding Subsection (m)(1), if a person who possesses the qualifications described by that subdivision is not available in the county in which the court is located, the court may require that the counseling be conducted by another person the court considers qualified for that purpose.
    
    (o)  During any period of possession of or access to the child ordered under Subsection (l) the petitioner has the rights and duties specified by Section [153.074](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=153.074), subject to any limitation specified by the court in its order.

    (1)  had no knowledge of the abortion;  or
    
    (2)  participated in or consented to the abortion for the sole purpose of preventing the death of the mother.

    (b)  If, for the two years after the birth of the child, the parent was married to or cohabiting with the other parent of the child, the court may order the termination of the parent-child relationship of the parent and the child if the court finds that:
