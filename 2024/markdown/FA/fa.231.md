    Sec. 231.0011.  DEVELOPMENT OF STATEWIDE INTEGRATED SYSTEM FOR CHILD SUPPORT, MEDICAL SUPPORT, AND DENTAL SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT.  (a)  The Title IV-D agency shall have final approval authority on any contract or proposal for delivery of Title IV-D services under this section and in coordination with the Texas Judicial Council, the Office of Court Administration of the Texas Judicial System, the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement, and state, county, and local officials, shall develop and implement a statewide integrated system for child support, medical support, and dental support enforcement, employing federal, state, local, and private resources to:
    
    (1)  unify child support registry functions;
    
    (2)  record and track all child support orders entered in the state;
    
    (3)  establish an automated enforcement process which will use delinquency monitoring, billing, and other enforcement techniques to ensure the payment of current support;
    
    (4)  incorporate existing enforcement resources into the system to obtain maximum benefit from state and federal funding; and
    
    (5)  ensure accountability for all participants in the process, including state, county, and local officials, private contractors, and the judiciary.
    
    (b)  Counties and other providers of child support services shall be required, as a condition of participation in the unified system, to enter into a contract with the Title IV-D agency, to comply with all federal requirements for the Title IV-D program, and to maintain at least the current level of funding for activities which are proposed to be included in the integrated child support system.
    
    (c)  The Title IV-D agency may contract with any county meeting technical system requirements necessary to comply with federal law for provision of Title IV-D services in that county.

    (1)  direct provision of services by county personnel;
    
    (2)  subcontracting all or portions of the services to private entities or attorneys; or
    
    (3)  such other methods as may be approved by the Title IV-D agency.

Locally generated funds include but are not limited to funds contributed by counties and cities.
    
    (f)  The Title IV-D agency shall adopt rules to implement this section.
    
    (g)  Participation in the statewide integrated system for child support, medical support, and dental support enforcement by a county is voluntary, and nothing in this section shall be construed to mandate participation.
    
    (h)  This section does not limit the ability of the Title IV-D agency to enter into an agreement with a county for the provision of services as authorized under Section [231.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=231.002).

    "Under Section [231.006](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=231.006), Family Code, the vendor or applicant certifies that the individual or business entity named in this contract, bid, or application is not ineligible to receive the specified grant, loan, or payment and acknowledges that this contract may be terminated and payment may be withheld if this certification is inaccurate."

    (c)  The Title IV-D agency is the sole assignee of all payments, including payments of compensation, by the state to a person indebted to the state under Subsection (a).
    
    (d)  On request of the Title IV-D agency:
    
    (1)  the comptroller shall make payable and deliver to the agency any payments for which the agency is the assignee under Subsection (c), if the comptroller is responsible for issuing warrants or initiating electronic funds transfers to make those payments;  and

The comptroller or a state agency may rely on a representation by the Title IV-D agency that a withholding or assignment under this section would not violate this subsection.
