    Sec. 33.002.  PARENTAL NOTICE.
    
    (a)  A physician may not perform an abortion on a pregnant unemancipated minor unless:
    
    (1)  the physician performing the abortion gives at least 48 hours actual notice, in person or by telephone, of the physician's intent to perform the abortion to:
    
    (A)  a parent of the minor, if the minor has no managing conservator or guardian; or
    
    (B)  a court-appointed managing conservator or guardian;
    
    (2)  the physician who is to perform the abortion receives an order issued by a court under Section [33.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=33.003) or [33.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=33.004) authorizing the minor to consent to the abortion as provided by Section [33.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=33.003) or [33.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=33.004); or
    
    (3)  the physician who is to perform the abortion:
    
    (A)  concludes that a medical emergency exists;
    
    (B)  certifies in writing to the Department of State Health Services and in the patient's medical record the medical indications supporting the physician's judgment that a medical emergency exists; and
    
    (C)  provides the notice required by Section [33.0022](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=33.0022).
    
    (b)  If a person to whom notice may be given under Subsection (a)(1) cannot be notified after a reasonable effort, a physician may perform an abortion if the physician gives 48 hours constructive notice, by certified mail, restricted delivery, sent to the last known address, to the person to whom notice may be given under Subsection (a)(1).  The period under this subsection begins when the notice is mailed.  If the person required to be notified is not notified within the 48-hour period, the abortion may proceed even if the notice by mail is not received.
    
    (c)  The requirement that 48 hours actual notice be provided under this section may be waived by an affidavit of:
    
    (1)  a parent of the minor, if the minor has no managing conservator or guardian;  or
    
    (2)  a court-appointed managing conservator or guardian.
    
    (d)  A physician may execute for inclusion in the minor's medical record an affidavit stating that, according to the best information and belief of the physician, notice or constructive notice has been provided as required by this section.  Execution of an affidavit under this subsection creates a presumption that the requirements of this section have been satisfied.
    
    (e)  The  Department of State Health Services shall prepare a form to be used for making the certification required by Subsection (a)(3)(B).
    
    (f)  A certification required by Subsection (a)(3)(B) is confidential and privileged and is not subject to disclosure under Chapter [552](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552), Government Code, or to discovery, subpoena, or other legal process.  Personal or identifying information about the minor, including her name, address, or social security number, may not be included in a certification under Subsection (a)(3)(B).  The physician must keep the medical records on the minor in compliance with the rules adopted by the Texas Medical Board under Section [153.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=153.003), Occupations Code.
    
    (g)  A physician who intentionally performs an abortion on a pregnant unemancipated minor in violation of this section commits an offense.  An offense under this subsection is punishable by a fine not to exceed $10,000. In this subsection, "intentionally" has the meaning assigned by Section [6.03](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=6.03)(a), Penal Code.
    
    (h)  It is a defense to prosecution under this section that the minor falsely represented her age or identity to the physician to be at least 18 years of age by displaying an apparently valid proof of identity and age described by Subsection (k) such that a reasonable person under similar circumstances would have relied on the representation.  The defense does not apply if the physician is shown to have had independent knowledge of the minor's actual age or identity or failed to use due diligence in determining the minor's age or identity.  In this subsection, "defense" has the meaning and application assigned by Section [2.03](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=2.03), Penal Code.
    
    (i)  In relation to the trial of an offense under this section in which the conduct charged involves a conclusion made by the physician under Subsection (a)(3)(A), the defendant may seek a hearing before the Texas Medical Board on whether the physician's conduct was necessary because of a medical emergency.  The findings of the Texas Medical Board under this subsection are admissible on that issue in the trial of the defendant.  Notwithstanding any other reason for a continuance provided under the Code of Criminal Procedure or other law, on motion of the defendant, the court shall delay the beginning of the trial for not more than 30 days to permit a hearing under this subsection to take place.
    
    (j)  A physician shall use due diligence to determine that any woman on which the physician performs an abortion who claims to have reached the age of majority or to have had the disabilities of minority removed has, in fact, reached the age of majority or has had the disabilities of minority removed. 
    
    (k)  For the purposes of this section, "due diligence" includes requesting proof of identity and age described by Section [2.005](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=2.005)(b) or a copy of the court order removing disabilities of minority.
    
    (l)  If proof of identity and age cannot be provided, the physician shall provide information on how to obtain proof of identity and age. If the woman is subsequently unable to obtain proof of identity and age and the physician chooses to perform the abortion, the physician shall document that proof of identity and age was not obtained and report to the Department of State Health Services that proof of identity and age was not obtained for the woman on whom the abortion was performed.  The department shall report annually to the legislature regarding the number of abortions performed without proof of identity and age.

    (1)  the performance of the abortion; and
    
    (2)  the basis for the physician's determination that a medical emergency existed that required the performance of a medical emergency abortion without fulfilling the requirements of Section [33.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=33.002) or [33.0021](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=33.0021).
    
    (b)  A physician who performs an abortion as described by Subsection (a), not later than 48 hours after the abortion is performed, shall send a written notice that a medical emergency occurred and the ability of the parent, managing conservator, or guardian to contact the physician for more information and medical records, to the last known address of the parent, managing conservator, or guardian by certified mail, restricted delivery, return receipt requested.  The physician may rely on last known address information if a reasonable and prudent person, under similar circumstances, would rely on the information as sufficient evidence that the parent, managing conservator, or guardian resides at that address.  The physician shall keep in the minor's medical record:
    
    (1)  the return receipt from the written notice; or
    
    (2)  if the notice was returned as undeliverable, the notice.
    
    (c)  A physician who performs an abortion on an unemancipated minor during a medical emergency as described by Subsection (a) shall execute for inclusion in the medical record of the minor an affidavit that explains the specific medical emergency that necessitated the immediate abortion.

    (1)  the minor is mature and sufficiently well informed to make the decision to have an abortion performed without notification to or consent of a parent, managing conservator, or guardian; or

    (q)  A minor whose application is denied may subsequently submit an application to the court that denied the application if the minor shows that there has been a material change in circumstances since the time the court denied the application.
    
    (r)  An attorney retained by the minor to assist her in filing an application under this section shall fully inform himself or herself of the minor's prior application history, including the representations made by the minor in the application regarding her address, proper venue in the county in which the application is filed, and whether a prior application has been filed and initiated.
