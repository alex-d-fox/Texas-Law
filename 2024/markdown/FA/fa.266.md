    Sec. 266.009.  PROVISION OF MEDICAL CARE IN EMERGENCY.  (a)  Consent or court authorization for the medical care of a foster child otherwise required by this chapter is not required in an emergency during which it is immediately necessary to provide medical care to the foster child to prevent the imminent probability of death or substantial bodily harm to the child or others, including circumstances in which:
    
    (1)  the child is overtly or continually threatening or attempting to commit suicide or cause serious bodily harm to the child or others; or
    
    (2)  the child is exhibiting the sudden onset of a medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity, including severe pain, such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in placing the child's health in serious jeopardy, serious impairment of bodily functions, or serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.
    
    (b)  The physician providing the medical care or designee shall notify the person authorized to consent to medical care for a foster child about the decision to provide medical care without consent or court authorization in an emergency not later than the second business day after the date of the provision of medical care under this section.

    Sec. 266.010.  CONSENT TO MEDICAL CARE BY FOSTER CHILD AT LEAST 16 YEARS OF AGE.  (a)  A foster child who is at least 16 years of age may consent to the provision of medical care, except as provided by Chapter [33](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=33), if the court with continuing jurisdiction determines that the child has the capacity to consent to medical care.  If the child provides consent by signing a consent form, the form must be written in language the child can understand.
    
    (b)  A court with continuing jurisdiction may make the determination regarding the foster child's capacity to consent to medical care during a hearing under Chapter [263](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=263) or may hold a hearing to make the determination on its own motion.  The court may issue an order authorizing the child to consent to all or some of the medical care as defined by Section [266.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=266.001).  In addition, a foster child who is at least 16 years of age, or the foster child's attorney ad litem, may file a petition with the court for a hearing.  If the court determines that the foster child lacks the capacity to consent to medical care, the court may consider whether the foster child has acquired the capacity to consent to medical care at subsequent hearings under Section [263.5031](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=263.5031).
    
    (c)  If the court determines that a foster child lacks the capacity to consent to medical care, the person authorized by the court under Section [266.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=266.004) shall continue to provide consent for the medical care of the foster child.
    
    (d)  If a foster child who is at least 16 years of age and who has been determined to have the capacity to consent to medical care refuses to consent to medical care and the department or private agency providing substitute care or case management services to the child believes that the medical care is appropriate, the department or the private agency may file a motion with the court requesting an order authorizing the provision of the medical care.
    
    (e)  The motion under Subsection (d) must include:
    
    (1)  the child's stated reasons for refusing the medical care; and
    
    (2)  a statement prepared and signed by the treating physician that the medical care is the proper course of treatment for the foster child.
    
    (f)  If a motion is filed under Subsection (d), the court shall appoint an attorney ad litem for the foster child if one has not already been appointed.  The foster child's attorney ad litem shall:
    
    (1)  discuss the situation with the child;
    
    (2)  discuss the suitability of the medical care with the treating physician;
    
    (3)  review the child's medical and mental health records; and
    
    (4)  advocate to the court on behalf of the child's expressed preferences regarding the medical care.
    
    (g)  The court shall issue an order authorizing the provision of the medical care in accordance with a motion under Subsection (d) to the foster child only if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, after the hearing that the medical care is in the best interest of the foster child and:
    
    (1)  the foster child lacks the capacity to make a decision regarding the medical care;
    
    (2)  the failure to provide the medical care will result in an observable and material impairment to the growth, development, or functioning of the foster child; or
    
    (3)  the foster child is at risk of suffering substantial bodily harm or of inflicting substantial bodily harm to others.
    
    (h)  In making a decision under this section regarding whether a foster child has the capacity to consent to medical care, the court shall consider:
    
    (1)  the maturity of the child;
    
    (2)  whether the child is sufficiently well informed to make a decision regarding the medical care; and
    
    (3)  the child's intellectual functioning.
    
    (i)  In determining whether the medical care is in the best interest of the foster child, the court shall consider:
    
    (1)  the foster child's expressed preference regarding the medical care, including perceived risks and benefits of the medical care;
    
    (2)  likely consequences to the foster child if the child does not receive the medical care;
    
    (3)  the foster child's prognosis, if the child does receive the medical care; and
    
    (4)  whether there are alternative, less intrusive treatments that are likely to reach the same result as provision of the medical care.
    
    (j)  This section does not apply to emergency medical care.  An emergency relating to a foster child who is at least 16 years of age, other than a child in an inpatient mental health facility, is governed by Section [266.009](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=266.009).
    
    (k)  This section does not apply to the administration of medication under Subchapter [G](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=574.101), Chapter [574](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=574), Health and Safety Code, to a foster child who is at least 16 years of age and who is placed in an inpatient mental health facility.
    
    (l)  Before a foster child reaches the age of 16, the department or the private agency providing substitute care or case management services to the foster child shall advise the foster child of the right to a hearing under this section to determine whether the foster child may consent to medical care.  The department or the private agency providing substitute care or case management services shall provide the foster child with training on informed consent and the provision of medical care as part of the Preparation for Adult Living Program.
