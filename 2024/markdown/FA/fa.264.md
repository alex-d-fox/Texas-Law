    (1)  evaluate whether contracting for additional capacity at residential treatment centers, facilities that provide mental inpatient or outpatient beds for crisis intervention and stabilization purposes only for children with severe behavioral health or mental health needs, and other potential temporary placement options provides the best methods for meeting capacity shortages; and
    
    (2)  make a recommendation to the department regarding contracting for additional capacity.
    
    (b-2)  A plan developed under Subsection (b-1) that includes the use of an inpatient or outpatient mental health facility must require the facility to discharge a child placed in the facility not later than 72 hours after the treating health care provider determines it is not medically necessary for the child to remain in the facility.
    
    (b-3)  The plan developed under Subsection (b-1) must include information and contingency plans to ensure adequate capacity in other facilities to meet placement needs when a facility is placed on probation.
    
    (b-4)  The department and each single source continuum contractor shall contract with facilities for reserve beds to ensure the department may place each child in a facility if capacity is otherwise unavailable.
    
    (c)  A foster care capacity needs plan developed under Subsection (b) must be:
    
    (1)  submitted to and approved by the commissioner; and
    
    (2)  updated annually.
    
    (d)  The department shall publish each initial foster care capacity needs plan and each annual update to a plan on the department's Internet website.

    (d)  The petition shall be supported by a sworn affidavit by a person based on personal knowledge and stating facts sufficient to support a finding that:
    
    (1)  the child has been a victim of abuse or neglect or is at substantial risk of abuse or neglect; and
    
    (2)  there is a continuing danger to the physical health or safety of the child caused by an act or failure to act of the parent, managing conservator, guardian, or other member of the child's household unless that person participates in services requested by the department.
    
    (e)  In a suit filed under this section, the court may render a temporary restraining order as provided by Section [105.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=105.001), except that the court may not issue an order that places the child:

    (2)  in the conservatorship of the department.
    
    (f)  The court shall hold a hearing on the petition not later than the 14th day after the date the petition is filed unless the court finds good cause for extending that date for not more than 14 days.
    
    (g)  The court shall appoint an attorney ad litem to represent the interests of the child immediately after the filing but before the hearing to ensure adequate representation of the child.  The attorney ad litem for the child shall have the powers and duties of an attorney ad litem for a child under Chapter [107](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=107).
    
    (h)  The court shall appoint an attorney ad litem to represent the interests of a parent for whom participation in services is being requested immediately after the filing but before the hearing to ensure adequate representation of the parent.  The attorney ad litem for the parent shall have the powers and duties of an attorney ad litem for a parent under Section [107.0131](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=107.0131).

    (1)  the parent's right to be represented by an attorney; and
    
    (2)  for a parent who is indigent and appears in opposition to the motion, the parent's right to a court-appointed attorney.

The court may consider additional evidence to determine whether the parent is indigent, including evidence relating to the parent's income, source of income, assets, property ownership, benefits paid in accordance with a federal, state, or local public assistance program, outstanding obligations, and necessary expenses and the number and ages of the parent's dependents.  If the court determines the parent is indigent, the attorney ad litem appointed to represent the interests of the parent may continue the representation.

    (k)  The court may, for good cause shown, postpone any subsequent proceedings for not more than seven days after the date of the attorney ad litem's discharge to allow the parent to hire an attorney or to provide the parent's attorney time to prepare for the subsequent proceeding.
    
    (l)  An order may be rendered under this section only after notice and hearing.
    
    (m)  At the conclusion of the hearing, the court shall deny the petition unless the court finds sufficient evidence to satisfy a person of ordinary prudence and caution that:
    
    (1)  abuse or neglect has occurred or there is a substantial risk of abuse or neglect or continuing danger to the physical health or safety of the child caused by an act or failure to act of the parent, managing conservator, guardian, or other member of the child's household; and
    
    (2)  services are necessary to ensure the physical health or safety of the child.
    
    (n)  If the court renders an order granting the petition, the court shall:
    
    (1)  state its findings in the order;
    
    (2)  make appropriate temporary orders under Chapter [105](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=105) necessary to ensure the safety of the child, except that the court may not issue a temporary order that places the child:
    
    (A)  outside of the child's home; or
    
    (B)  in the conservatorship of the department; and
    
    (3)  order the participation in specific services narrowly tailored to address the findings made by the court under Subsection (m).
    
    (o)  If the court finds that a parent, managing conservator, guardian, or other member of the child's household did not cause the continuing danger to the physical health or safety of the child or the substantial risk of abuse or neglect, or was not the perpetrator of the abuse or neglect alleged, the court may not require that person to participate in services ordered under Subsection (n).
    
    (p)  Not later than the 90th day after the date the court renders an order under this section, the court shall hold a hearing to review the status of each person required to participate in the services and the child and the services provided, purchased, or referred.  The court shall set subsequent review hearings every 90 days to review the continued need for the order.
    
    (q)  An order rendered under this section expires on the 180th day after the date the order is signed unless the court extends the order as provided by Subsection (r) or (s).
    
    (r)  The court may extend an order rendered under this section on a showing by the department of a continuing need for the order, after notice and hearing.  Except as provided by Subsection (s), the court may extend the order only one time for not more than 180 days.
    
    (s)  The court may extend an order rendered under this section for not more than an additional 180 days only if:
    
    (1)  the court finds that:
    
    (A)  the extension is necessary to allow the person required to participate in services under the plan of service time to complete those services;
    
    (B)  the department made a good faith effort to timely provide the services to the person;
    
    (C)  the person made a good faith effort to complete the services; and
    
    (D)  the completion of the services is necessary to ensure the physical health and safety of the child; and
    
    (2)  the extension is requested by the person or the person's attorney.
    
    (t)  At any time, a person affected by the order may request the court to terminate the order. The court shall terminate the order on finding the order is no longer needed.

    (b-1)  The department shall disburse monetary assistance provided to a caregiver under Subsection (b) in the same manner as the department disburses payments to a foster parent.  The department may not provide monetary assistance to an eligible caregiver under Subsection (b) after the first anniversary of the date the caregiver receives the first monetary assistance payment from the department under this section.  The department, at its discretion and for good cause, may extend the monetary assistance payments for an additional six months.

    (d)  The department, in accordance with department rules, shall implement a process to verify that each relative and designated caregiver who is seeking monetary assistance or additional support services from the department for day care as defined by Section [264.124](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=264.124) for a child under this section has attempted to find appropriate day-care services for the child through community services, including Head Start programs, prekindergarten classes, and early education programs offered in public schools.  The department shall specify the documentation the relative or designated caregiver must provide to the department to demonstrate compliance with the requirements established under this subsection.  The department may not provide monetary assistance or additional support services to the relative or designated caregiver for the day care unless the department receives the required verification.
    
    (e)  The department may provide monetary assistance or additional support services to a relative or designated caregiver for day care without the verification required under Subsection (d) if the department determines the verification would prevent an emergency placement that is in the child's best interest.
    
    (f)  If a person who has a family income that is less than or equal to 300 percent of the federal poverty level enters into a caregiver assistance agreement with the department, obtains permanent managing conservatorship of a child, and meets all other eligibility requirements, the person may receive an annual reimbursement of other expenses for the child, as determined by rules adopted by the executive commissioner, not to exceed $500 per year until the earlier of:
    
    (1)  the third anniversary of the date the person was awarded permanent managing conservatorship of the child; or
    
    (2)  the child's 18th birthday.

    (b)  A parental child safety placement agreement must contain the following statement in boldface type and capital letters:  "YOUR AGREEMENT TO THE PARENTAL CHILD SAFETY PLACEMENT IS NOT AN ADMISSION OF CHILD ABUSE OR NEGLECT ON YOUR PART AND CANNOT BE USED AGAINST YOU AS AN ADMISSION OF CHILD ABUSE OR NEGLECT."

    (c)  If the department determines that the child is unable to safely return to the parent or person who made the parental child safety placement, the department shall determine whether the child can remain safely in the home of the caregiver or whether the department must seek legal conservatorship of the child in order to ensure the child's safety.
