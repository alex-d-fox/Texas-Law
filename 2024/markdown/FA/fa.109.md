    (A)  define the injury or state why the injury is irreparable; or
    
    (B)  include an order setting the suit for trial on the merits with respect to the ultimate relief sought.

    (b-3)  The trial court retains jurisdiction to modify and enforce a temporary order under this section unless the appellate court, on a proper showing, supersedes the court's order.
    
    (b-4)  On the motion of a party or on the court's own motion, after notice and hearing, the trial court may modify a previous temporary order rendered under this section if:
    
    (1)  the circumstances of a party have materially and substantially changed since the rendition of the previous order; and
    
    (2)  modification is equitable and necessary for the safety and welfare of the child.
    
    (b-5)  A party may seek review of the trial court's temporary order under this section by:
    
    (1)  petition for writ of mandamus; or
    
    (2)  proper assignment in the party's brief.
    
    (c)  A temporary order rendered under this section is not subject to interlocutory appeal.
    
    (d)  The court may not suspend under Subsection (a)(6) the operation of an order or judgment terminating the parent-child relationship in a suit brought by the state or a political subdivision of the state permitted by law to bring the suit.
