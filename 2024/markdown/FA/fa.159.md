    (3)  if none of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this chapter, the tribunal of this state shall issue a child support order that controls.
    
    (c)  If two or more child support orders have been issued for the same obligor and same child, on request of a party who is an individual or that is a support enforcement agency, a tribunal of this state having personal jurisdiction over both the obligor and the obligee who is an individual shall determine which order controls under Subsection (b).  The request may be filed with a registration for enforcement or registration for modification under Subchapter G or may be filed as a separate proceeding.
    
    (d)  A request to determine which is the controlling order must be accompanied by a copy of every child support order in effect and the applicable record of payments.  The requesting party shall give notice of the request to each party whose rights may be affected by the determination.
    
    (e)  The tribunal that issued the controlling order under Subsection (a), (b), or (c) has continuing jurisdiction to the extent provided by Section [159.205](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=159.205) or [159.206](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=159.206).
    
    (f)  A tribunal of this state that determines by order which is the controlling order under Subsection (b)(1) or (2) or Subsection (c), or that issues a new controlling order under Subsection (b)(3), shall state in that order:
    
    (1)  the basis upon which the tribunal made its determination;
    
    (2)  the amount of prospective support, if any; and
    
    (3)  the total amount of consolidated arrears and accrued interest, if any, under all of the orders after all payments made are credited as provided by Section [159.209](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=159.209).
    
    (g)  Within 30 days after issuance of an order determining which order is the controlling order, the party obtaining the order shall file a certified copy of the controlling order in each tribunal that issued or registered an earlier order of child support.  A party or support enforcement agency obtaining the order that fails to file a certified copy is subject to appropriate sanctions by a tribunal in which the issue of failure to file arises.  The failure to file does not affect the validity or enforceability of the controlling order.
    
    (h)  An order that has been determined to be the controlling order, or a judgment for consolidated arrears of support and interest, if any, made under this section, must be recognized in proceedings under this chapter.

    (b)  If an obligee prevails, a responding tribunal of this state may assess against an obligor filing fees, reasonable attorney's fees, other costs, and necessary travel and other reasonable expenses incurred by the obligee and the obligee's witnesses.  The tribunal may not assess fees, costs, or expenses against the obligee or the support enforcement agency of either the initiating or responding state or foreign country, except as provided by other law.  Attorney's fees may be taxed as costs, and may be ordered paid directly to the attorney, who may enforce the order in the attorney's own name.

    (1)  the issuing tribunal lacked personal jurisdiction over the contesting party;

    (b)  If a party presents evidence establishing a full or partial defense under Subsection (a), a tribunal may stay enforcement of the registered support order, continue the proceeding to permit production of additional relevant evidence, and issue other appropriate orders.  An uncontested portion of the registered support order may be enforced by all remedies available under the law of this state.

    Sec. 159.611.  MODIFICATION OF CHILD SUPPORT ORDER OF ANOTHER STATE.  (a)  If Section 159.613 does not apply, on petition a tribunal of this state may modify a child support order issued in another state that is registered in this state if, after notice and hearing, the tribunal finds that:
    
    (1)  the following requirements are met:
    
    (A)  the child, the obligee who is an individual, and the obligor do not reside in the issuing state;
    
    (B)  a petitioner who is a nonresident of this state seeks modification; and
    
    (C)  the respondent is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this state; or
    
    (2)  this state is the residence of the child, or a party who is an individual is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this state, and all of the parties who are individuals have filed consents in a record in the issuing tribunal for a tribunal of this state to modify the support order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.
    
    (b)  Modification of a registered child support order is subject to the same requirements, procedures, and defenses that apply to the modification of an order issued by a tribunal of this state, and the order may be enforced and satisfied in the same manner.
    
    (c)  A tribunal of this state may not modify any aspect of a child support order that may not be modified under the law of the issuing state, including the duration of the obligation of support.  If two or more tribunals have issued child support orders for the same obligor and same child, the order that controls and must be so recognized under Section 159.207 establishes the aspects of the support order that are nonmodifiable.
    
    (d)  In a proceeding to modify a child support order, the law of the state that is determined to have issued the initial controlling order governs the duration of the obligation of support. The obligor's fulfillment of the duty of support established by that order precludes imposition of a further obligation of support by a tribunal of this state.
    
    (e)  On issuance of an order by a tribunal of this state modifying a child support order issued in another state, the tribunal of this state becomes the tribunal of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.
    
    (f)  Notwithstanding Subsections (a) through (e) of this section and Section 159.201(b), a tribunal of this state retains jurisdiction to modify an order issued by a tribunal of this state if:
    
    (1)  one party resides in another state; and
    
    (2)  the other party resides outside the United States.

    (1)  may enforce the order that was modified only as to arrears and interest accruing before the modification;
    
    (2)  may provide appropriate relief for violations of the order that occurred before the effective date of the modification; and

    (b)  The following grounds are the only grounds on which a tribunal of this state may refuse recognition and enforcement of a registered Convention support order:

    (6)  a proceeding between the same parties and having the same purpose is pending before a tribunal of this state and that proceeding was the first to be filed;
    
    (7)  the order is incompatible with a more recent support order involving the same parties and having the same purpose if the more recent support order is entitled to recognition and enforcement under this chapter in this state;
    
    (8)  payment, to the extent alleged arrears have been paid in whole or in part;
    
    (9)  in a case in which the respondent neither appeared nor was represented in the proceeding in the issuing foreign country:
    
    (A)  if the law of that country provides for prior notice of proceedings, the respondent did not have proper notice of the proceedings and an opportunity to be heard; or
    
    (B)  if the law of that country does not provide for prior notice of the proceedings, the respondent did not have proper notice of the order and an opportunity to be heard in a challenge or appeal on fact or law before a tribunal; or
    
    (10)  the order was made in violation of Section 159.711.
    
    (c)  If a tribunal of this state does not recognize a Convention support order under Subsection (b)(2), (4), or (9):
    
    (1)  the tribunal may not dismiss the proceeding without allowing a reasonable time for a party to request the establishment of a new Convention support order; and
    
    (2)  the office of the attorney general shall take all appropriate measures to request a child support order for the obligee if the application for recognition and enforcement was received under Section 159.704.

    (1)  recognition and enforcement of the agreement is manifestly incompatible with public policy;
    
    (2)  the agreement was obtained by fraud or falsification;
    
    (3)  the agreement is incompatible with a support order involving the same parties and having the same purpose in this state, another state, or a foreign country if the support order is entitled to recognition and enforcement under this chapter in this state; or

    Sec. 159.711.  MODIFICATION OF CONVENTION CHILD SUPPORT ORDER. (a) A tribunal of this state may not modify a Convention child support order if the obligee remains a resident of the foreign country where the support order was issued unless:
    
    (1)  the obligee submits to the jurisdiction of a tribunal of this state, either expressly or by defending on the merits of the case without objecting to the jurisdiction at the first available opportunity; or
    
    (2)  the foreign tribunal lacks or refuses to exercise jurisdiction to modify its support order or issue a new support order.

    Sec. 159.802.  CONDITIONS OF RENDITION.
    
    (a)  Before making a demand that the governor of another state surrender an individual charged criminally in this state with having failed to provide for the support of an obligee, the governor of this state may require a prosecutor of this state to demonstrate that, not less than 60 days previously, the obligee had initiated proceedings for support under this chapter or that the proceeding would be of no avail.
    
    (b)  If, under this chapter or a law substantially similar to this chapter, the governor of another state makes a demand that the governor of this state surrender an individual charged criminally in that state with having failed to provide for the support of a child or other individual to whom a duty of support is owed, the governor may require a prosecutor to investigate the demand and report whether a proceeding for support has been initiated or would be effective.  If it appears that a proceeding would be effective but has not been initiated, the governor may delay honoring the demand for a reasonable time to permit the initiation of a proceeding.
    
    (c)  If a proceeding for support has been initiated and the individual whose rendition is demanded prevails, the governor may decline to honor the demand.  If the petitioner prevails and the individual whose rendition is demanded is subject to a support order, the governor may decline to honor the demand if the individual is complying with the support order.
