    CHAPTER 105. SETTINGS, HEARINGS, AND ORDERS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 105.001.  TEMPORARY ORDERS BEFORE FINAL ORDER.  (a)  In a suit, the court may make a temporary order, including the modification of a prior temporary order, for the safety and welfare of the child, including an order:
    
    (1)  for the temporary conservatorship of the child;
    
    (2)  for the temporary support of the child;
    
    (3)  restraining a party from disturbing the peace of the child or another party;
    
    (4)  prohibiting a person from removing the child beyond a geographical area identified by the court;  or
    
    (5)  for payment of reasonable attorney's fees and expenses.
    
    (a-1)  If the court on its own motion refers to mediation a suit in which an initial hearing regarding the rendition of a temporary order described by Subsection (a) has not yet occurred, the court may not postpone the hearing to a date that is later than the 30th day after the date set for the hearing.
    
    (b)  Except as provided by Subsection (c), temporary restraining orders and temporary injunctions under this section shall be granted without the necessity of an affidavit or verified pleading stating specific facts showing that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result before notice can be served and a hearing can be held.  Except as provided by Subsection (h), an order may not be rendered under Subsection (a)(1), (2), or (5) except after notice and a hearing.  A temporary restraining order or temporary injunction granted under this section need not:
    
    (1)  define the injury or state why it is irreparable;
    
    (2)  state why the order was granted without notice;  or
    
    (3)  include an order setting the cause for trial on the merits with respect to the ultimate relief requested.
    
    (c)  Except on a verified pleading or an affidavit in accordance with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, an order may not be rendered:
    
    (1)  attaching the body of the child;
    
    (2)  taking the child into the possession of the court or of a person designated by the court;  or
    
    (3)  excluding a parent from possession of or access to a child.
    
    (d)  In a suit, the court may dispense with the necessity of a bond in connection with temporary orders on behalf of the child.
    
    (e)  Temporary orders rendered under this section are not subject to interlocutory appeal.
    
    (f)  The violation of a temporary restraining order, temporary injunction, or other temporary order rendered under this section is punishable by contempt and the order is subject to and enforceable under Chapter [157](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=157).
    
    (g)  The rebuttable presumptions established in favor of the application of the guidelines for a child support order and for the standard possession order under Chapters [153](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=153) and [154](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=154) apply to temporary orders.  The presumptions do not limit the authority of the court to render other temporary orders.
    
    (h)  An order under Subsection (a)(1) may be rendered without notice and an adversary hearing if the order is an emergency order sought by a governmental entity under Chapter [262](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=262).

    (1)  the social security number and driver's license number of each party to the suit, including the child, except that the child's social security number or driver's license number is not required if the child has not been assigned a social security number or driver's license number; and
    
    (2)  each party's current residence address, mailing address, e-mail address, home telephone number, name of employer, address of employment, and work telephone number, except as provided by Subsection (c).

    (1)  the 60th day before the date the party intends to make the change;  or
    
    (2)  the fifth day after the date that the party knew of the change, if the party did not know or could not have known of the change in sufficient time to comply with Subdivision (1).
    
    (c)  If a court finds after notice and hearing that requiring a party to provide the information required by this section to another party is likely to cause the child or a conservator harassment, abuse, serious harm, or injury, or to subject the child or a conservator to family violence, as defined by Section [71.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=71.004), the court may:

    "FAILURE OF A PARTY TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT DOES NOT JUSTIFY DENYING THAT PARTY COURT-ORDERED POSSESSION OF OR ACCESS TO A CHILD. REFUSAL BY A PARTY TO ALLOW POSSESSION OF OR ACCESS TO A CHILD DOES NOT JUSTIFY FAILURE TO PAY COURT-ORDERED CHILD SUPPORT TO THAT PARTY."
    
    (e)  Except as provided by Subsection (c), an order in a suit that orders child support or possession of or access to a child must also contain the following prominently displayed statement in boldfaced type, capital letters, or underlined:

THE PARTY IS ORDERED TO GIVE NOTICE OF AN INTENDED CHANGE IN ANY OF THE REQUIRED INFORMATION TO EACH OTHER PARTY, THE COURT, AND THE STATE CASE REGISTRY ON OR BEFORE THE 60TH DAY BEFORE THE INTENDED CHANGE.  IF THE PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR COULD NOT HAVE KNOWN OF THE CHANGE IN SUFFICIENT TIME TO PROVIDE 60-DAY NOTICE, THE PARTY IS ORDERED TO GIVE NOTICE OF THE CHANGE ON OR BEFORE THE FIFTH DAY AFTER THE DATE THAT THE PARTY KNOWS OF THE CHANGE."

    "NOTICE TO ANY PEACE OFFICER OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:  YOU MAY USE REASONABLE EFFORTS TO ENFORCE THE TERMS OF CHILD CUSTODY SPECIFIED IN THIS ORDER. A PEACE OFFICER WHO RELIES ON THE TERMS OF A COURT ORDER AND THE OFFICER'S AGENCY ARE ENTITLED TO THE APPLICABLE IMMUNITY AGAINST ANY CLAIM, CIVIL OR OTHERWISE, REGARDING THE OFFICER'S GOOD FAITH ACTS PERFORMED IN THE SCOPE OF THE OFFICER'S DUTIES IN ENFORCING THE TERMS OF THE ORDER THAT RELATE TO CHILD CUSTODY. ANY PERSON WHO KNOWINGLY PRESENTS FOR ENFORCEMENT AN ORDER THAT IS INVALID OR NO LONGER IN EFFECT COMMITS AN OFFENSE THAT MAY BE PUNISHABLE BY CONFINEMENT IN JAIL FOR AS LONG AS TWO YEARS AND A FINE OF AS MUCH AS $10,000."

    (2)  IT HAS BEEN THREE YEARS SINCE THE ORDER WAS RENDERED OR LAST MODIFIED AND THE MONTHLY AMOUNT OF THE CHILD SUPPORT AWARD UNDER THE ORDER DIFFERS BY EITHER 20 PERCENT OR $100 FROM THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE AWARDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CHILD SUPPORT GUIDELINES."
    
    (f)  Except for an action in which contempt is sought, in any subsequent child support enforcement action, the court may, on a showing that diligent effort has been made to determine the location of a party, consider due process requirements for notice and service of process to be met with respect to that party on delivery of written notice to the most recent residence address, e-mail address, or address of employment filed by that party with the court and the state case registry.
    
    (g)  The Title IV-D agency shall promulgate and provide forms for a party to use in reporting to the court and the state case registry under Chapter [234](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=234) the information required under this section.
    
    (h)  The court may include in a final order in a suit in which a party to the suit makes an allegation of child abuse or neglect a finding on whether the party who made the allegation knew that the allegation was false.  This finding shall not constitute collateral estoppel for any criminal proceeding.  The court may impose on a party found to have made a false allegation of child abuse or neglect any civil sanction permitted under law, including attorney's fees, costs of experts, and any other costs.
