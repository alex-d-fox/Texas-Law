    (2)  the child is alleged to have engaged in delinquent conduct that included a violation of a penal law listed in Section [53.045](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=53.045) and no adjudication concerning the alleged conduct has been made.
    
    (b)  A court conducting a waiver of jurisdiction and discretionary transfer hearing under this section shall conduct the hearing according to Sections [54.02](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=54.02)(j), (k), and (l).
    
    (c)  If after the hearing the juvenile court waives its jurisdiction and transfers the person to criminal court, the juvenile court shall send notification of the transfer of a child under Subsection (a) to the inpatient mental health facility.  The criminal court shall, within 90 days of the transfer, institute proceedings under Chapter [46B](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=46B), Code of Criminal Procedure.  If those or any subsequent proceedings result in a determination that the defendant is competent to stand trial, the defendant may not receive a punishment for the delinquent conduct described by Subsection (a)(2) that results in confinement for a period longer than the maximum period of confinement the defendant could have received if the defendant had been adjudicated for the delinquent conduct while still a child and within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.

    SUBCHAPTER C. CHILD UNFIT TO PROCEED AS A RESULT OF MENTAL ILLNESS OR INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 55.31.  UNFITNESS TO PROCEED DETERMINATION;  EXAMINATION.  (a)  A child alleged by petition or found to have engaged in delinquent conduct or conduct indicating a need for supervision who as a result of mental illness or an intellectual disability lacks capacity to understand the proceedings in juvenile court or to assist in the child's own defense is unfit to proceed and shall not be subjected to discretionary transfer to criminal court, adjudication, disposition, or modification of disposition as long as such incapacity endures.
    
    (b)  On a motion by a party, the juvenile court shall determine whether probable cause exists to believe that a child who is alleged by petition or who is found to have engaged in delinquent conduct or conduct indicating a need for supervision is unfit to proceed as a result of mental illness or an intellectual disability. In making its determination, the court may:
    
    (1)  consider the motion, supporting documents, professional statements of counsel, and witness testimony; and
    
    (2)  make its own observation of the child.
    
    (c)  If the court determines that probable cause exists to believe that the child is unfit to proceed, the court shall temporarily stay the juvenile court proceedings and immediately order the child to be examined under Section [55.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=55.04).
    
    (d)  During an examination ordered under this section, and in any report based on that examination, an expert shall consider, in addition to other issues determined relevant by the expert:
    
    (1)  whether the child, as supported by current indications and the child's personal history:
    
    (A)  is a child with mental illness; or
    
    (B)  is a child with an intellectual disability; 
    
    (2)  the child's capacity to:
    
    (A)  appreciate the allegations against the child;
    
    (B)  appreciate the range and nature of allowable dispositions that may be imposed in the proceedings against the child;
    
    (C)  understand the roles of the participants and the adversarial nature of the legal process;
    
    (D)  display appropriate courtroom behavior; and 
    
    (E)  testify relevantly; and
    
    (3)  the degree of impairment resulting from the child's mental illness or intellectual disability and the specific impact on the child's capacity to engage with counsel in a reasonable and rational manner.
    
    (e)  An expert's report to the court must state an opinion on the child's fitness to proceed or explain why the expert is unable to state that opinion and include:
    
    (1)  the child's history and current status regarding any possible mental illness or intellectual disability;
    
    (2)  the child's developmental history as it relates to any possible mental illness or intellectual disability;
    
    (3)  the child's functional abilities related to fitness to stand trial;
    
    (4)  the relationship between deficits in the child's functional abilities related to fitness to proceed and any mental illness or intellectual disability; and
    
    (5)  if the expert believes the child is in need of remediation or restoration services, a discussion of:
    
    (A)  whether the child's abilities are likely to be remediated or restored within the period described by Section [55.33](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=55.33)(a)(1), (2), or (3);
    
    (B)  whether the child may be adequately treated in an alternative setting;
    
    (C)  any recommended interventions to aid in the remediation or restoration of the child's fitness; 
    
    (D)  whether the child meets criteria for court-ordered treatment or services under Section [55.05](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=55.05) or [55.06](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=55.06); and
    
    (E)  if applicable, the specific criteria the child meets under Paragraph (D).
    
    (f)  After considering all relevant information, including information obtained from an examination under Section [55.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=55.04), the court shall:
    
    (1)  if the court determines that evidence exists to support a finding that the child is unfit to proceed, proceed under Section [55.32](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=55.32); or
    
    (2)  if the court determines that evidence does not exist to support a finding that the child is unfit to proceed, dissolve the stay and continue the juvenile court proceedings.

    (d)  Lack of responsibility for conduct as a result of mental illness or an intellectual disability must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence.
    
    (e)  In its findings or verdict the court or jury must state whether the child is not responsible for the child's conduct as a result of mental illness or an intellectual disability.
    
    (f)  If the court or jury finds the child is not responsible for the child's conduct as a result of mental illness or an intellectual disability, the court shall proceed under Section [55.52](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=55.52).
    
    (g)  A child found to be not responsible for the child's conduct as a result of mental illness or an intellectual disability shall not be subject to proceedings under this title with respect to such conduct, other than proceedings under Section [55.52](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=55.52).
