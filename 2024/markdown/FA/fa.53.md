    (c)  When custody of a child is given to the office or official designated by the juvenile board, the intake officer, probation officer, or other person authorized by the board shall promptly give notice of the whereabouts of the child and a statement of the reason the child was taken into custody to the child's parent, guardian, or custodian unless the notice given under Section [52.02](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=52.02)(b) provided fair notice of the child's present whereabouts.
    
    (d)  Unless the juvenile board approves a written procedure proposed by the office of prosecuting attorney and chief juvenile probation officer which provides otherwise, if it is determined that the person is a child and, regardless of a finding of probable cause, or a lack thereof, there is an allegation that the child engaged in delinquent conduct of the grade of felony, or conduct constituting a misdemeanor offense involving violence to a person or the use or possession of a firearm, location-restricted knife, or club, as those terms are defined by Section [46.01](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=46.01), Penal Code, or prohibited weapon, as described by Section [46.05](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=46.05), Penal Code, the case shall be promptly forwarded to the office of the prosecuting attorney, accompanied by:

    (e)  If a juvenile board adopts an alternative referral plan under Subsection (d), the board shall register the plan with the Texas Juvenile Justice Department.
    
    (f)  A juvenile board may not adopt an alternate referral plan that does not require the forwarding of a child's case to the prosecuting attorney as provided by Subsection (d) if probable cause exists to believe that the child engaged in delinquent conduct that violates Section [19.03](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=19.03), Penal Code (capital murder), or Section [19.02](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=19.02), Penal Code (murder).
