    (1)  assure that children will have frequent and continuing contact with parents who have shown the ability to act in the best interest of the child;
    
    (2)  provide a safe, stable, and nonviolent environment for the child;  and
    
    (3)  encourage parents to share in the rights and duties of raising their child after the parents have separated or dissolved their marriage.
    
    (b)  A court may not render an order that conditions the right of a conservator to possession of or access to a child on the payment of child support.
    
    
    
    
    Added by Acts 1995, 74th Leg., ch. 20, Sec. 1, eff. April 20, 1995.  Amended by Acts 1995, 74th Leg., ch. 751, Sec. 25, eff. Sept. 1, 1995;  Acts 1999, 76th Leg., ch. 787, Sec. 2, eff. Sept. 1, 1999.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 153.002.  BEST INTEREST OF CHILD.  The best interest of the child shall always be the primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of conservatorship and possession of and access to the child.
    
    
    
    
    Added by Acts 1995, 74th Leg., ch. 20, Sec. 1, eff. April 20, 1995.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 153.003.  NO DISCRIMINATION BASED ON SEX OR MARITAL STATUS.  The court shall consider the qualifications of the parties without regard to their marital status or to the sex of the party or the child in determining:
    
    (1)  which party to appoint as sole managing conservator;
    
    (2)  whether to appoint a party as joint managing conservator;  and
    
    (3)  the terms and conditions of conservatorship and possession of and access to the child.
    
    
    
    
    Added by Acts 1995, 74th Leg., ch. 20, Sec. 1, eff. April 20, 1995.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 153.004.  HISTORY OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR SEXUAL ABUSE.  (a)  In determining whether to appoint a party as a sole or joint managing conservator, the court shall consider evidence of the intentional use of abusive physical force, or evidence of sexual abuse, by a party directed against the party's spouse, a parent of the child, or any person younger than 18 years of age committed within a two-year period preceding the filing of the suit or during the pendency of the suit.
    
    (b)  The court may not appoint joint managing conservators if credible evidence is presented of a history or pattern of past or present child neglect, or physical or sexual abuse by one parent directed against the other parent, a spouse, or a child, including a sexual assault in violation of Section [22.011](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=22.011) or [22.021](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=22.021), Penal Code, that results in the other parent becoming pregnant with the child.  A history of sexual abuse includes a sexual assault that results in the other parent becoming pregnant with the child, regardless of the prior relationship of the parents.  It is a rebuttable presumption that the appointment of a parent as the sole managing conservator of a child or as the conservator who has the exclusive right to determine the primary residence of a child is not in the best interest of the child if credible evidence is presented of a history or pattern of past or present child neglect, or physical or sexual abuse by that parent directed against the other parent, a spouse, or a child.
    
    (c)  The court shall consider the commission of family violence or sexual abuse in determining whether to deny, restrict, or limit the possession of a child by a parent who is appointed as a possessory conservator.
    
    (d)  The court may not allow a parent to have access to a child for whom it is shown by a preponderance of the evidence that:
    
    (1)  there is a history or pattern of committing family violence during the two years preceding the date of the filing of the suit or during the pendency of the suit; or
    
    (2)  the parent engaged in conduct that constitutes an offense under Section [21.02](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=21.02), [22.011](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=22.011), [22.021](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=22.021), or [25.02](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=25.02), Penal Code, and that as a direct result of the conduct, the victim of the conduct became pregnant with the parent's child.
    
    (d-1)  Notwithstanding Subsection (d), the court may allow a parent to have access to a child if the court:
    
    (1)  finds that awarding the parent access to the child would not endanger the child's physical health or emotional welfare and would be in the best interest of the child; and
    
    (2)  renders a possession order that is designed to protect the safety and well-being of the child and any other person who has been a victim of family violence committed by the parent and that may include a requirement that:
    
    (A)  the periods of access be continuously supervised by an entity or person chosen by the court;
    
    (B)  the exchange of possession of the child occur in a protective setting;
    
    (C)  the parent abstain from the consumption of alcohol or a controlled substance, as defined by Chapter [481](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=481), Health and Safety Code, within 12 hours prior to or during the period of access to the child; or
    
    (D)  the parent attend and complete a battering intervention and prevention program as provided by Article [42.141](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=42.141), Code of Criminal Procedure, or, if such a program is not available, complete a course of treatment under Section [153.010](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=153.010).
    
    (e)  It is a rebuttable presumption that it is not in the best interest of a child for a parent to have unsupervised visitation with the child if credible evidence is presented of a history or pattern of past or present child neglect or abuse or family violence by:
    
    (1)  that parent; or
    
    (2)  any person who resides in that parent's household or who is permitted by that parent to have unsupervised access to the child during that parent's periods of possession of or access to the child.
    
    (f)  In determining under this section whether there is credible evidence of a history or pattern of past or present child neglect or abuse or family violence by a parent or other person, as applicable, the court shall consider whether a protective order was rendered under Chapter [85](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=85), Title 4, against the parent or other person during the two-year period preceding the filing of the suit or during the pendency of the suit.

    (1)  "Abuse" and "neglect" have the meanings assigned by Section [261.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=261.001).

    (b)  A managing conservator must be a parent, a competent adult, the Department of Family and Protective Services, or a licensed child-placing agency.
    
    (c)  In making an appointment authorized by this section, the court shall consider whether, preceding the filing of the suit or during the pendency of the suit:

    (b)  If the parties agree to binding arbitration, the court shall render an order reflecting the arbitrator's award unless the court determines at a non-jury hearing that the award is not in the best interest of the child.

    (1)  that:
    
    (A)  a party to the agreement was a victim of family violence, and that circumstance impaired the party's ability to make decisions; or
    
    (B)  the agreement would permit a person who is subject to registration under Chapter [62](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=62), Code of Criminal Procedure, on the basis of an offense committed by the person when the person was 17 years of age or older or who otherwise has a history or pattern of past or present physical or sexual abuse directed against any person to:
    
    (i)  reside in the same household as the child; or
    
    (ii)  otherwise have unsupervised access to the child; and

    (f)  A party may at any time prior to the final mediation order file a written objection to the referral of a suit affecting the parent-child relationship to mediation on the basis of family violence having been committed by another party against the objecting party or a child who is the subject of the suit.  After an objection is filed, the suit may not be referred to mediation unless, on the request of a party, a hearing is held and the court finds that a preponderance of the evidence does not support the objection.  If the suit is referred to mediation, the court shall order appropriate measures be taken to ensure the physical and emotional safety of the party who filed the objection.  The order shall provide that the parties not be required to have face-to-face contact and that the parties be placed in separate rooms during mediation.  This subsection does not apply to suits filed under Chapter [262](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=262).
    
    (g)  The provisions for confidentiality of alternative dispute resolution procedures under Chapter [154](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=154), Civil Practice and Remedies Code, apply equally to the work of a parenting coordinator, as defined by Section [153.601](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=153.601), and to the parties and any other person who participates in the parenting coordination.

    (b)  If a conservator of a child requests the court to order periods of electronic communication with the child under this section, the court may award the conservator reasonable periods of electronic communication with the child to supplement the conservator's periods of possession of the child.  In determining whether to award electronic communication, the court shall consider:
    
    (1)  whether electronic communication is in the best interest of the child;
    
    (2)  whether equipment necessary to facilitate the electronic communication is reasonably available to all parties subject to the order; and

    (d)  The court may not consider the availability of electronic communication as a factor in determining child support.  The availability of electronic communication under this section is not intended as a substitute for physical possession of or access to the child where otherwise appropriate.
    
    (e)  In a suit in which the court's order contains provisions related to a finding of family violence in the suit, including supervised visitation, the court may award periods of electronic communication under this section only if:
    
    (1)  the award and terms of the award are mutually agreed to by the parties; and
    
    (2)  the terms of the award:
    
    (A)  are printed in the court's order in boldfaced, capitalized type; and
    
    (B)  include any specific restrictions relating to family violence or supervised visitation, as applicable, required by other law to be included in a possession or access order.

    Sec. 153.251.  POLICY AND GENERAL APPLICATION OF GUIDELINES.  (a)  The guidelines established in the standard possession order are intended to guide the courts in ordering the terms and conditions for possession of a child by a parent named as a possessory conservator or as the minimum possession for a joint managing conservator.
    
    (b)  It is the policy of this state to encourage frequent contact between a child and each parent for periods of possession that optimize the development of a close and continuing relationship between each parent and child.
    
    (c)  It is preferable for all children in a family to be together during periods of possession.
    
    (d)  The standard possession order is designed to apply to a child three years of age or older.

    (2)  is in the best interest of the child.

    Sec. 153.253.  STANDARD POSSESSION ORDER INAPPROPRIATE OR UNWORKABLE.

    Sec. 153.254.  CHILD LESS THAN THREE YEARS OF AGE.  (a)  The court shall render an order appropriate under the circumstances for possession of a child less than three years of age.  In rendering the order, the court shall consider evidence of all relevant factors, including:
    
    (1)  the caregiving provided to the child before and during the current suit;
    
    (2)  the effect on the child that may result from separation from either party;
    
    (3)  the availability of the parties as caregivers and the willingness of the parties to personally care for the child;

    (7)  the presence of siblings during periods of possession;
    
    (8)  the child's need to develop healthy attachments to both parents;
    
    (9)  the child's need for continuity of routine;
    
    (10)  the location and proximity of the residences of the parties;

    (A)  the age of the child; or
    
    (B)  minimal or inconsistent contact with the child by a party;

    Sec. 153.502.  ABDUCTION RISK FACTORS.  (a)  To determine whether there is a risk of the international abduction of a child by a parent of the child, the court shall consider evidence that the parent:
    
    (1)  has taken, enticed away, kept, withheld, or concealed a child in violation of another person's right of possession of or access to the child, unless the parent presents evidence that the parent believed in good faith that the parent's conduct was necessary to avoid imminent harm to the child or the parent;
    
    (2)  has previously threatened to take, entice away, keep, withhold, or conceal a child in violation of another person's right of possession of or access to the child;

    (b)  If the court finds that there is credible evidence of a risk of abduction of the child by a parent of the child based on the court's consideration of the factors in Subsection (a), the court shall also consider evidence regarding the following factors to evaluate the risk of international abduction of the child by a parent:

    (c)  If the court finds that there is credible evidence of a risk of abduction of the child by a parent of the child based on the court's consideration of the factors in Subsection (a), the court may also consider evidence regarding the following factors to evaluate the risk of international abduction of the child by a parent:
    
    (1)  whether the parent is undergoing a change in status with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service that would adversely affect that parent's ability to legally remain in the United States;
