    CHAPTER 59. PROGRESSIVE SANCTIONS MODEL
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 59.001.  PURPOSES.  The purposes of the progressive sanctions model are to:
    
    (1)  ensure that juvenile offenders face uniform and consistent consequences and punishments that correspond to the seriousness of each offender's current offense, prior delinquent history, special treatment or training needs, and effectiveness of prior interventions;
    
    (2)  balance public protection and rehabilitation while holding juvenile offenders accountable;
    
    (3)  permit flexibility in the decisions made in relation to the juvenile offender to the extent allowed by law;
    
    (4)  consider the juvenile offender's circumstances;
    
    (5)  recognize that departure of a disposition from this model is not necessarily undesirable and in some cases is highly desirable;  and
    
    (6)  improve juvenile justice planning and resource allocation by ensuring uniform and consistent reporting of disposition decisions at all levels.

    (c)  Subject to Subsection (e), if the child's subsequent commission of delinquent conduct or conduct indicating a need for supervision involves a violation of a penal law of a classification that is the same as or greater than the classification of the child's previous conduct, the juvenile court may assign the child a sanction level authorized by law that is one level higher than the previously assigned sanction level.
