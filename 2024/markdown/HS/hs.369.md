    Sec. 369.002.  SYMBOLS FOR CERTAIN PLASTIC CONTAINERS.  (a)  A person may not manufacture or distribute a plastic bottle or rigid plastic container unless the appropriate symbol indicating the plastic resin used to produce the bottle or container is molded into or imprinted on the bottom or near the bottom of the bottle or container.
    
    (b)  A plastic bottle or rigid plastic container with a base cup or other component of a material different from the basic material used in making the bottle or container shall bear the symbol indicating its basic material.
    
    (c)  The symbols used under this section must consist of a number placed within a triangle of arrows and of letters placed below the triangle of arrows.  The triangle must be equilateral, formed by three arrows with the apex of each point of the triangle at the midpoint of each arrow, rounded with a short radius.  The arrowhead of each arrow must be at the midpoint of each side of the triangle with a short gap separating the arrowhead from the base of the adjacent arrow.  The triangle formed by the arrows must depict a clockwise path around the number.
    
    (d)  The numbers, letters of the symbols, and the plastic resins represented by the symbols are:

    (f)  The commission shall:
    
    (1)  maintain a list of the symbols;  and
    
    (2)  provide a copy of that list to any person on request.
