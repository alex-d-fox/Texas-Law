    Sec. 574.083.  RETURN TO FACILITY UNDER CERTIFICATE OF FACILITY ADMINISTRATOR OR COURT ORDER.  (a)  The facility administrator of a facility to which a patient was admitted for court-ordered inpatient health care services may authorize a peace officer of the municipality or county in which the facility is located to take an absent patient into custody, detain the patient, and return the patient to the facility by issuing a certificate as prescribed by Subsection (c) to a law enforcement agency of the municipality or county.
    
    (b)  If there is reason to believe that an absent patient may be outside the municipality or county in which the facility is located, the facility administrator may file an affidavit as prescribed by Subsection (c) with a magistrate requesting the magistrate to issue an order for the patient's return.  The magistrate with whom the affidavit is filed may issue an order directing a peace or health officer to take an absent patient into custody and return the patient to the facility.  An order issued under this subsection extends to any part of this state and authorizes any peace officer to whom the order is directed or transferred to execute the order, take the patient into custody, detain the patient, and return the patient to the facility.
    
    (c)  The certificate issued or affidavit filed under Subsection (a) or (b) must set out facts establishing that the patient is receiving court-ordered inpatient mental health services at the facility and show that the facility administrator reasonably believes that:

    (2)  the patient has violated the conditions of a pass or furlough;  or
    
    (3)  the patient's condition has deteriorated to the extent that the patient's continued absence from the facility under a pass or furlough is inappropriate.
    
    (d)  A peace or health officer shall take the patient into custody and return the patient to the facility as soon as possible if the patient's return is authorized by a certificate issued or court order issued under this section.
    
    (e)  A peace or health officer may take the patient into custody without having the certificate or court order in the officer's possession.
    
    (f)  A peace or health officer who cannot immediately return a patient to the facility named in the order may transport the patient to a local facility for detention.  The patient may not be detained in a nonmedical facility that is used to detain persons who are charged with or convicted of a crime unless detention in the facility is warranted by an extreme emergency.  If the patient is detained at a nonmedical facility:
    
    (1)  the patient:
    
    (A)  may not be detained in the facility for more than 24 hours;  and
    
    (B)  must be isolated from all persons charged with or convicted of a crime;  and
    
    (2)  the facility must notify the county health authority of the detention.
    
    (g)  The local mental health authority shall ensure that a patient detained in a nonmedical facility under Subsection (f) receives proper care and medical attention.

    (2)  is in custody awaiting trial in a criminal proceeding and was ordered to receive inpatient mental health services in the six months preceding a hearing under this section.
    
    (a-1)  The court may issue an order under this section only if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence after the hearing:
    
    (1)  that the patient lacks the capacity to make a decision regarding the administration of the proposed medication and treatment with the proposed medication is in the best interest of the patient; or
    
    (2)  if the patient was ordered to receive inpatient mental health services by a criminal court with jurisdiction over the patient, that treatment with the proposed medication is in the best interest of the patient and either:
    
    (A)  the patient presents a danger to the patient or others in the inpatient mental health facility in which the patient is being treated as a result of a mental disorder or mental defect as determined under Section [574.1065](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=574.1065); or

    (b)  In making the finding that treatment with the proposed medication is in the best interest of the patient, the court shall consider:
    
    (1)  the patient's expressed preferences regarding treatment with psychoactive medication;
    
    (2)  the patient's religious beliefs;
    
    (3)  the risks and benefits, from the perspective of the patient, of taking psychoactive medication;
    
    (4)  the consequences to the patient if the psychoactive medication is not administered;
    
    (5)  the prognosis for the patient if the patient is treated with psychoactive medication;
    
    (6)  alternative, less intrusive treatments that are likely to produce the same results as treatment with psychoactive medication; and
    
    (7)  less intrusive treatments likely to secure the patient's agreement to take the psychoactive medication.

    (d)  A judge may refer a hearing to a magistrate or court-appointed associate judge who has training regarding psychoactive medications.

    (e)  A party is entitled to a hearing de novo by the judge if an appeal of the magistrate's or associate judge's report is filed with the court within three days after the report is issued.  The hearing de novo shall be held within 30 days of the filing of the application for an order to authorize psychoactive medication.
    
    (f)  If a hearing or an appeal of an associate judge's or magistrate's report is to be held in a county court in which the judge is not a licensed attorney, the proposed patient or the proposed patient's attorney may request that the proceeding be transferred to a court with a judge who is licensed to practice law in this state.  The county judge shall transfer the case after receiving the request, and the receiving court shall hear the case as if it had been originally filed in that court.
    
    (g)  As soon as practicable after the conclusion of the hearing, the patient is entitled to have provided to the patient and the patient's attorney written notification of the court's determinations under this section.  The notification shall include a statement of the evidence on which the court relied and the reasons for the court's determinations.
    
    (h)  An order entered under this section shall authorize the administration to a patient, regardless of the patient's refusal, of one or more classes of psychoactive medications specified in the application and consistent with the patient's diagnosis.  The order shall permit an increase or decrease in a medication's dosage, restitution of medication authorized but discontinued during the period the order is valid, or the substitution of a medication within the same class.

    (1)  authorizes the initiation of any appropriate mental health treatment for the patient awaiting transfer; and
