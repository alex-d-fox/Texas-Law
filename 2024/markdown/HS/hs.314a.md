(a)  A person aggrieved by a decision of the designated agency in granting, denying, or refusing to act on an application for a certificate of public advantage submitted under Subchapter B or revoking a certificate of public advantage issued under this chapter may appeal the final order by filing a petition for judicial review in a district court of Travis County.
    
    (b)  The filing of a petition for judicial review of a decision by the designated agency to revoke a certificate of public advantage stays enforcement of the agency's decision.
    
    (c)  Not later than the 45th day after the date a person files a petition for judicial review under this section, the designated agency shall submit to the district court the original copy or a certified copy of the entirety of the agency's record regarding the decision under review.  By stipulation of all parties, the record may be shortened.  The district court may require or permit later corrections or additions to the record.  The district court may extend the period prescribed by this subsection for submitting the agency's record to the court.
    
    (d)  The district court shall conduct the review sitting without a jury.

    (2)  in excess of the agency's statutory authority;
    
    (3)  made through unlawful procedure;
    
    (4)  arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion; or

    (f)  Under Subsection (e)(5), in determining the substantiality of the evidence, the district court:
    
    (1)  shall consider other evidence that detracts from the substantiality; and
    
    (2)  may not substitute its judgment for the judgment of the designated agency on the weight of the evidence as to a question of fact.
    
    (g)  The district court shall issue a written decision setting forth the court's findings of fact and conclusions of law.  The designated agency shall add the court's decision to the agency's record.

    Sec. 314A.201.  CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMAND.  (a)  The attorney general, at any time after an application is filed under Section [314A.052](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=314A.052) and before the designated agency makes a determination on the application, or in connection with the agency's annual review of a certificate of public advantage under Section [314A.059](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=314A.059), may require by civil investigative demand the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of documents in Travis County or the county in which the applicants are located for the purpose of investigating whether the merger agreement satisfies or, after issuance of the certificate of public advantage, continues to satisfy the standard prescribed by Section [314A.056](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=314A.056)(a)(1).

    Sec. 314A.202.  ACTION TO REVOKE CERTIFICATE OF PUBLIC ADVANTAGE FOLLOWING CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES.  (a)  If, following an annual review of a certificate of public advantage, the attorney general determines that as a result of changed circumstances the benefits resulting from a certified merger agreement as described by Section [314A.056](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=314A.056)(a)(1)(A) no longer outweigh any disadvantages attributable to a reduction in competition resulting from the merger agreement, the attorney general may bring an action in a district court in Travis County seeking to revoke the certificate of public advantage in accordance with the procedures prescribed by this section.
    
    (b)  Except as provided by Subsection (c), in an action brought under this section, the attorney general has the burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that as a result of changed circumstances the benefits resulting from the certified merger agreement and the unavoidable costs of revoking the certificate of public advantage are outweighed by disadvantages attributable to a reduction in competition resulting from the merger agreement.
    
    (c)  In any action brought under this section, if the attorney general first establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the designated agency's certification was obtained as a result of material misrepresentation to the designated agency or the attorney general or as the result of coercion, threats, or intimidation directed toward any party to the merger agreement, then the parties to the merger agreement bear the burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that despite changed circumstances the benefits resulting from the certified merger agreement and the unavoidable costs of revoking the certificate of public advantage are not outweighed by disadvantages attributable to a reduction in competition resulting from the merger agreement.
