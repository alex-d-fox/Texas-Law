    Acts 2015, 84th Leg., R.S., Ch. 1 (S.B. [219](http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/84R/billtext/html/SB00219F.HTM)), Sec. 3.1401, eff. April 2, 2015.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 591.002.  PURPOSE.  (a)  It is the public policy of this state that persons with an intellectual disability have the opportunity to develop to the fullest extent possible their potential for becoming productive members of society.
    
    (b)  It is the purpose of this subtitle to provide and assure a continuum of quality services to meet the needs of all persons with an intellectual disability in this state.
    
    (c)  The state's responsibility to persons with an intellectual disability does not replace or impede parental rights and responsibilities or terminate the activities of persons, groups, or associations that advocate for and assist persons with an intellectual disability.
    
    (d)  It is desirable to preserve and promote living at home if feasible.  If living at home is not possible and placement in a residential care facility is necessary, a person must be admitted in accordance with basic due process requirements, giving appropriate consideration to parental desires if possible.  The person must be admitted to a facility that provides habilitative training for the person's condition, that fosters the personal development of the person, and that enhances the person's ability to cope with the environment.
    
    (e)  Because persons with an intellectual disability have been denied rights solely because they are persons with an intellectual disability, the general public should be educated to the fact that persons with an intellectual disability who have not been adjudicated incompetent and for whom a guardian has not been appointed by a due process proceeding in a court have the same rights and responsibilities enjoyed by all citizens of this state.  All citizens are urged to assist persons with an intellectual disability in acquiring and maintaining rights and in participating in community life as fully as possible.
