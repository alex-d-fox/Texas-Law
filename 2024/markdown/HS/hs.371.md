    SUBCHAPTER A. GENERAL PROVISIONS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 371.001.  SHORT TITLE.  This chapter may be cited as the Texas Used Oil Collection, Management, and Recycling Act.
    
    
    
    
    Added by Acts 1991, 72nd Leg., ch. 303, Sec. 8, eff. Sept. 1, 1991.  Amended by Acts 1995, 74th Leg., ch. 887, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1995.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 371.002.  FINDINGS.  The legislature finds that:
    
    (1)  when properly managed and recycled, used oil is a valuable energy resource;
    
    (2)  used oil can be recycled into a number of different products;
    
    (3)  improper disposal of used oil is a significant environmental problem and a waste of a potentially valuable energy resource;
    
    (4)  there is a need for an expanded statewide network of used oil collection sites for private citizens who change their own motor oil;
    
    (5)  the private sector, with incentives, is best equipped to establish and operate used oil collection centers that are convenient for the public;
    
    (6)  the need for publicly operated used oil collection centers is greatest in more sparsely populated areas of the state and should diminish over time;
    
    (7)  the United States Environmental Protection Agency has issued final regulations that properly classify and regulate used oil and used oil filters in accordance with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (42 U.S.C. Section 6901 et seq.);
    
    (8)  the current used oil and used oil filter program in this state imposes more stringent management requirements than the regulations of the United States Environmental Protection Agency;
    
    (9)  limited public money is needed to finance public and private infrastructure investments to collect, manage, and recycle used motor oil;
    
    (10)  the used oil management standards under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (42 U.S.C. Section 6901 et seq.) establish a balanced approach to the objectives of preserving a valuable resource and protecting the natural environment;  and
    
    (11)  recycling, reuse, treatment, or proper disposal of used oil produces a more advantageous cost-benefit ratio in accomplishing the goals of state law, and these considerations should be included in the source reduction and waste minimization plans adopted under Section [361.505](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=361.505) to the extent applicable.

    Sec. 371.0025.  PURPOSE AND SCOPE.  (a)  The purposes of this chapter are to:
    
    (1)  ensure that this state's used oil program is consistent with and not more stringent than the federal program for the management of used oil under 40 C.F.R. Part 279 unless otherwise required by state or federal law;  and
    
    (2)  establish a program to promote public and private do-it-yourselfer used oil collection centers and used oil collection centers.
    
    (b)  This chapter does not apply to used oil:

    (2)  exempted under 40 C.F.R. Section 279.10(g) because the oil has been introduced into a crude oil pipeline or is being processed at a petroleum refining facility;  or
    
    (3)  generated through other activities exempted under 40 C.F.R. Part 271 or 279.
    
    (c)  This chapter does not apply to a used oil filter generated in connection with activities regulated by the Railroad Commission of Texas under Chapter [91](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=91) or [141](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=141), Natural Resources Code, or Chapter [27](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=27), Water Code.
