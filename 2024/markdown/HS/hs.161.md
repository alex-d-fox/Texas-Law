    (a-4)  After an individual's 18th birthday, the department shall make a reasonable effort to provide notice to an individual whose immunization information is included in the registry with consent that was provided by a parent, managing conservator, or guardian under Subsection (a-1).  The reasonable effort shall include at least two attempts by the department to provide the notice required by this subsection by telephone or e-mail, by regular mail to the individual's last known address, or by general outreach efforts through the individual's health care provider, school district, or institution of higher education.

    (5)  the minor decoy answers truthfully any questions about the minor's age at the time of the inspection, order, or delivery.

    (b)  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), a health care provider may consider an individual's disability when making a treatment recommendation or decision solely to the extent that a physician, following an individualized evaluation of the potential transplant recipient, determines the disability is medically significant to the organ transplant. This section does not require a referral or recommendation for, or the performance of, a medically inappropriate organ transplant.
    
    (c)  A health care provider may not consider an individual's inability to independently comply with post-transplant medical requirements as medically significant for the purposes of Subsection (b) if the individual has:
    
    (1)  a known disability; and
    
    (2)  the necessary support system to assist the individual in reasonably complying with the requirements.
    
    (d)  A health care facility shall make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures as necessary to allow individuals with a disability access to organ transplant-related services, including transplant-related counseling, information, or treatment, unless the health care facility can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the services or would impose an undue hardship on the facility.  Reasonable modifications in policies, practices, and procedures may include:
    
    (1)  communicating with persons supporting or assisting with the individual's postsurgical and post-transplant care, including medication; and
    
    (2)  considering the support available to the individual in determining whether the individual is able to reasonably comply with post-transplant medical requirements, including support provided by:
    
    (A)  family;
    
    (B)  friends; or
    
    (C)  home and community-based services, including home and community-based services funded by:
    
    (i)  Medicaid;
    
    (ii)  Medicare;

    (f)  A health care provider shall make reasonable efforts to provide auxiliary aids and services to an individual with a known disability seeking organ transplant-related services, including organ transplant-related counseling, information, or treatment, as necessary to allow the individual access to those services, unless the health care provider can demonstrate that providing the transplant-related services with auxiliary aids and services present would fundamentally alter the transplant-related services provided or would impose an undue hardship on the health care provider.
    
    (g)  A health care provider shall comply with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. Section 12101 et seq.) to the extent that Act applies to a health care provider.  This subsection may not be construed to require a health care provider to comply with that Act if the Act does not otherwise require compliance by the health care provider.
    
    (h)  This section applies to each stage of the organ transplant process.
    
    (i)  A violation of this section is grounds for disciplinary action by the regulatory agency that issued a license, certificate, or other authority to a health care provider who committed the violation.  Before a regulatory agency may take disciplinary action against a health care provider for a violation, the applicable regulatory agency shall:
    
    (1)  notify the health care provider of the agency's finding that the health care provider has violated or is violating this section or a rule adopted under this section; and
    
    (2)  provide the health care provider with an opportunity to correct the violation without penalty or reprimand.
    
    (j)  A physician who in good faith makes a determination that an individual's disability is medically significant to the organ transplant, as described by Subsection (b), does not violate this section.
    
    (k)  A health care provider who in good faith makes a treatment recommendation or decision on the basis of a physician's determination that an individual's disability is medically significant to the organ transplant, as described by Subsection (b), does not violate this section.
