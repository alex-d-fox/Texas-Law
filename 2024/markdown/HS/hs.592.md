(a)  A physician who is treating a client may file an application in a probate court or a court with probate jurisdiction on behalf of the state for an order to authorize the administration of a psychoactive medication regardless of the client's refusal if:
    
    (1)  the physician believes that the client lacks the capacity to make a decision regarding the administration of the psychoactive medication;
    
    (2)  the physician determines that the medication is the proper course of treatment for the client; and

    (1)  has been committed to a residential care facility; or
    
    (2)  is in custody awaiting trial in a criminal proceeding and was committed to a residential care facility in the six months preceding a hearing under this section.
    
    (b)  The court may issue an order under this section only if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence after the hearing:
    
    (1)  that the client lacks the capacity to make a decision regarding the administration of the proposed medication and that treatment with the proposed medication is in the best interest of the client; or
    
    (2)  if the client was committed to a residential care facility by a criminal court with jurisdiction over the client, that treatment with the proposed medication is in the best interest of the client, and either:
    
    (A)  the client presents a danger to the client or others in the residential care facility in which the client is being treated as a result of a mental disorder or mental defect as determined under Section [592.157](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=592.157); or
    
    (B)  the client:
    
    (i)  has remained confined in a correctional facility, as defined by Section [1.07](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=1.07), Penal Code, for a period exceeding 72 hours while awaiting transfer for competency restoration treatment; and

    (c)  In making the finding that treatment with the proposed medication is in the best interest of the client, the court shall consider:
    
    (1)  the client's expressed preferences regarding treatment with psychoactive medication;
    
    (2)  the client's religious beliefs;
    
    (3)  the risks and benefits, from the perspective of the client, of taking psychoactive medication;
    
    (4)  the consequences to the client if the psychoactive medication is not administered;
    
    (5)  the prognosis for the client if the client is treated with psychoactive medication;
    
    (6)  alternative, less intrusive treatments that are likely to produce the same results as treatment with psychoactive medication; and
    
    (7)  less intrusive treatments likely to secure the client's consent to take the psychoactive medication.
    
    (d)  A hearing under this subchapter shall be conducted on the record by the probate judge or judge with probate jurisdiction, except as provided by Subsection (e).
    
    (e)  A judge may refer a hearing to a magistrate or court-appointed associate judge who has training regarding psychoactive medications.  The magistrate or associate judge may effectuate the notice, set hearing dates, and appoint attorneys as required by this subchapter.  A record is not required if the hearing is held by a magistrate or court-appointed associate judge.
    
    (f)  A party is entitled to a hearing de novo by the judge if an appeal of the magistrate's or associate judge's report is filed with the court before the fourth day after the date the report is issued.  The hearing de novo shall be held not later than the 30th day after the date the application for an order to authorize psychoactive medication was filed.
    
    (g)  If a hearing or an appeal of an associate judge's or magistrate's report is to be held in a county court in which the judge is not a licensed attorney, the proposed client or the proposed client's attorney may request that the proceeding be transferred to a court with a judge who is licensed to practice law in this state.  The county judge shall transfer the case after receiving the request, and the receiving court shall hear the case as if it had been originally filed in that court.
    
    (h)  As soon as practicable after the conclusion of the hearing, the client is entitled to have provided to the client and the client's attorney written notification of the court's determinations under this section.  The notification shall include a statement of the evidence on which the court relied and the reasons for the court's determinations.
    
    (i)  An order entered under this section shall authorize the administration to a client, regardless of the client's refusal, of one or more classes of psychoactive medications specified in the application and consistent with the client's diagnosis.  The order shall permit an increase or decrease in a medication's dosage, restitution of medication authorized but discontinued during the period the order is valid, or the substitution of a medication within the same class.
    
    (j)  The classes of psychoactive medications in the order must conform to classes determined by the department.
    
    (k)  An order issued under this section may be reauthorized or modified on the petition of a party.  The order remains in effect pending action on a petition for reauthorization or modification.  For the purpose of this subsection, "modification" means a change of a class of medication authorized in the order.
    
    (l)  For a client described by Subsection (b)(2)(B), an order issued under this section:
    
    (1)  authorizes the initiation of any appropriate mental health treatment for the patient awaiting transfer; and
    
    (2)  does not constitute authorization to retain the client in a correctional facility for competency restoration treatment.
