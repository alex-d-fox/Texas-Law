    CHAPTER 312. MEDICAL AND DENTAL CLINICAL EDUCATION IN PUBLIC HOSPITALS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 312.001.  FINDING;  PURPOSE.  (a)  The legislature finds that the clinical education of medical and dental students, interns, residents, and fellows attending a medical and dental unit or a supported medical or dental school and the provision of patient care to public hospitals can be more effectively and economically undertaken if those institutions and hospitals coordinate and cooperate, rather than compete, in their common endeavors.
    
    (b)  The purpose of this chapter is to authorize coordination and cooperation between medical and dental units, supported medical or dental schools, and public hospitals and to remove impediments to that coordination and cooperation in order to:
    
    (1)  enhance the education of students, interns, residents, and fellows attending a medical and dental unit or a supported medical or dental school; 
    
    (2)  enhance patient care;  and
    
    (3)  avoid any waste of public money.
