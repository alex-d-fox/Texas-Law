    (3)  without paying the penalty, file a petition for judicial review contesting the occurrence of the violation, the amount of the penalty, or both the occurrence of the violation and the amount of the penalty.
    
    (b)  Within the 30-day period, a person who acts under Subsection (a)(3) may:
    
    (1)  stay enforcement of the penalty by:
    
    (A)  paying the amount of the penalty to the court for placement in an escrow account; or
    
    (B)  giving to the court a supersedeas bond that is approved by the court for the amount of the penalty and that is effective until all judicial review of the department's order is final; or
    
    (2)  request the court to stay enforcement of the penalty by:
    
    (A)  filing with the court a sworn affidavit of the person stating that the person is financially unable to pay the amount of the penalty and is financially unable to give the supersedeas bond; and
    
    (B)  giving a copy of the affidavit to the department by certified mail.
    
    (c)  If the department receives a copy of an affidavit under Subsection (b)(2), the department may file with the court, within five days after the date the copy is received, a contest to the affidavit.  The court shall hold a hearing on the facts alleged in the affidavit as soon as practicable and shall stay the enforcement of the penalty on finding that the alleged facts are true.  The person who files an affidavit has the burden of proving that the person is financially unable to pay the amount of the penalty and to give a supersedeas bond.
    
    (d)  If the person does not pay the amount of the penalty and the enforcement of the penalty is not stayed, the department may refer the matter to the attorney general for collection of the amount of the penalty.
    
    (e)  Judicial review of the order of the department:
    
    (1)  is instituted by filing a petition as provided by Subchapter [G](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001.171), Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code; and
    
    (2)  is under the substantial evidence rule.
    
    (f)  If the court sustains the occurrence of the violation, the court may uphold or reduce the amount of the penalty and order the person to pay the full or reduced amount of the penalty.  If the court does not sustain the occurrence of the violation, the court shall order that no penalty is owed.
    
    (g)  When the judgment of the court becomes final, the court shall proceed under this subsection.  If the person paid the penalty and if the amount of the penalty is reduced or the penalty is not upheld by the court, the court shall order that the appropriate amount plus accrued interest be remitted to the person.  The rate of the interest is the rate charged on loans to depository institutions by the New York Federal Reserve Bank, and the interest shall be paid for the period beginning on the date the penalty was paid and ending on the date the penalty is remitted.  If the person gave a supersedeas bond and if the penalty is not upheld by the court, the court shall order the release of the bond.  If the person gave a supersedeas bond and if the amount of the penalty is reduced, the court shall order the release of the bond after the person pays the amount.

    SUBCHAPTER E. EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AND TRAUMA CARE SYSTEMS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 773.111.  LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.  (a)  The legislature finds that death caused by injury is the leading cause of death for persons one through 44 years of age, and the third overall cause of death for all ages.  Effective emergency medical services response and resuscitation systems, medical care systems, and medical facilities reduce the occurrence of unnecessary mortality.
    
    (b)  It is estimated that trauma costs more than $63 million a day nationally, which includes lost wages, medical expenses, and indirect costs.  Proportionately, this cost to Texas would be more than $4 million a day.  Many hospitals provide emergency medical care to patients who are unable to pay for catastrophic injuries directly or through an insurance or entitlement program.
    
    (c)  In order to improve the health of the people of the state, it is necessary to improve the quality of emergency and medical care to the people of Texas who are victims of unintentional, life-threatening injuries by encouraging hospitals to provide trauma care and increasing the availability of emergency medical services.

    Sec. 773.112.  RULES.  (a)  The executive commissioner by rule shall adopt minimum standards and objectives to implement emergency medical services and trauma care systems.  The executive commissioner by rule shall provide for the designation of trauma facilities and for triage, transfer, and transportation policies.  The executive commissioner shall consider guidelines adopted by the American College of Surgeons and the American College of Emergency Physicians in adopting rules under this section.
    
    (b)  The rules must provide specific requirements for the care of trauma patients, must ensure that the trauma care is fully coordinated with all hospitals and emergency medical services in the delivery area, and must reflect the geographic areas of the state, considering time and distance.
    
    (c)  The rules must include:
    
    (1)  prehospital care management guidelines for triage and transportation of trauma patients;
    
    (2)  flow patterns of trauma patients and geographic boundaries regarding trauma patients;
    
    (3)  assurances that trauma facilities will provide quality care to trauma patients referred to the facilities;
    
    (4)  minimum requirements for resources and equipment needed by a trauma facility to treat trauma patients;
    
    (5)  standards for the availability and qualifications of the health care personnel, including physicians and surgeons, treating trauma patients within a facility;
    
    (6)  requirements for data collection, including trauma incidence reporting, system operation, and patient outcome;
    
    (7)  requirements for periodic performance evaluation of the system and its components;  and
    
    (8)  assurances that designated trauma facilities will not refuse to accept the transfer of a trauma patient from another facility solely because of the person's inability to pay for services or because of the person's age, sex, race, religion, or national origin.

    (a-1)  A grant recipient may not before the fourth anniversary of the date a grant is awarded under Subsection (a) dispose of an ambulance for which the total costs of purchasing the ambulance were paid only from grants awarded under Subsection (a) or Section [780.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=780.004)(a) unless the grant recipient obtains the department's prior approval.

The money shall be distributed on behalf of eligible recipients in each county to the trauma service area regional advisory council for that county.  To receive a distribution under this subsection, the regional advisory council must be incorporated as an entity that is exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(a), Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and its subsequent amendments, by being listed as an exempt organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the code.

Money that is not disbursed by a regional advisory council to eligible recipients for approved functions by the end of the fiscal year in which the funds were disbursed may be retained by the regional advisory council to be used during the following fiscal year in accordance with this subsection.  Money that is not disbursed by the regional advisory council during the following fiscal year shall be returned to the account.

Money distributed under this subsection shall be distributed on behalf of eligible recipients in each county to the trauma service area regional advisory council for that county.  To receive a distribution under this subsection, the regional advisory council must be incorporated as an entity that is exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(a), Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and its subsequent amendments, by being listed as an exempt organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the code. A regional advisory council's share of money distributed under this section shall be based on the relative geographic size and population of each trauma service area and on the relative amount of trauma care provided.  Money that is not disbursed by a regional advisory council to eligible recipients for approved functions by the end of the fiscal year in which the funds were disbursed may be retained by the regional advisory council to be used during the following fiscal year in accordance with this subsection.  Money that is not disbursed by the regional advisory council during the following fiscal year shall be returned to the account.
    
    (e)  In any fiscal year, the commissioner may use not more than three percent of the appropriated money from the accounts after any amount necessary to maintain the reserve established by Subsection (b) is deducted to fund the administrative costs of the department associated with administering the state emergency medical services program, the trauma program, and the accounts and to fund the costs of monitoring and providing technical assistance for those programs and the accounts.
    
    (f)  In any fiscal year, the commissioner shall use at least 27 percent of the appropriated money remaining from the accounts after any amount necessary to maintain the reserve established by Subsection (b) is deducted and the money from the accounts not otherwise distributed under this section to fund a portion of the uncompensated trauma care provided at facilities designated as state trauma facilities by the department.  The administrator of a designated facility may request a regional advisory council chairperson to petition the department for disbursement of funds to a designated trauma facility in the chairperson's trauma service area that has provided uncompensated trauma care.  Funds may be disbursed under this subsection based on a proportionate share of uncompensated trauma care provided in the state and may be used to fund innovative projects to enhance the delivery of patient care in the overall emergency medical services and trauma care system.
    
    (g)  The department shall review the percentages for disbursement of funds in the accounts on an annual basis and shall make recommendations for proposed changes to ensure that appropriate and fair funding is provided under this section.
