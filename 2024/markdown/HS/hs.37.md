    (b)  The executive commissioner, in cooperation with the Texas Education Agency, shall adopt rules for the mandatory spinal screening of children attending public or private schools.  In adopting rules under this subsection, the executive commissioner shall consider the most recent nationally accepted and peer-reviewed scientific research in determining the appropriate ages for conducting the spinal screening. The department shall coordinate the spinal screening program with any other screening program conducted by the department on those children.
    
    (b-1)  The executive commissioner, in cooperation with the Texas Education Agency, by rule shall develop a process to notify a parent, managing conservator, or guardian of:
    
    (1)  the screening requirement;
    
    (2)  the purposes of and reasons for the screening requirement, including prevention of painful scoliosis correction surgery and medical risks to the child if screening is declined;
    
    (3)  the noninvasive nature of the method used to conduct the screening; and
    
    (4)  the method for declining to comply with the screening requirement through the use of an exemption described by Section [37.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=37.002)(b).
    
    (c)  The executive commissioner shall adopt substantive and procedural rules necessary to administer screening activities.
    
    (d)  A rule adopted by the executive commissioner under this chapter may not require any expenditure by a school, other than an incidental expense required for certification training for nonhealth practitioners and for notification requirements under Section [37.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=37.003).
    
    (e)  The department may coordinate the spinal screening activities of school districts, private schools, state agencies, volunteer organizations, and other entities so that the efforts of each entity are complementary and not duplicative.  The department may provide technical assistance to those entities in developing screening programs and may provide educational and other material to assist local screening activities.
    
    (f)  The department shall monitor the quality of screening activities provided under this chapter.
