    SUBCHAPTER D. FINANCING STATE EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 771.071.  EMERGENCY SERVICE FEE.  (a)  Except as otherwise provided by this subchapter, the commission may impose a 9-1-1 emergency service fee on each local exchange access line or equivalent local exchange access line, including lines of customers in an area served by an emergency communication district participating in the applicable regional plan.  If a business service user provides residential facilities, each line that terminates at a residential unit, and that is a communication link equivalent to a residential local exchange access line, shall be charged the 9-1-1 emergency service fee.  The fee may not be imposed on a line to coin-operated public telephone equipment or to public telephone equipment operated by coin or by card reader.  The fee may also not be imposed on any line that the commission excluded from the definition of a local exchange access line or an equivalent local exchange access line pursuant to Section [771.063](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=771.063).
    
    (b)  The amount of the fee may not exceed 50 cents a month for each line.
    
    (c)  The commission may set the fee in a different amount in each regional planning commission region based on the cost of providing 9-1-1 service to each region.
    
    (d)  The fee does not apply to an emergency communication district not participating in the applicable regional plan.  A customer in an area served by an emergency communication district not participating in the regional plan may not be charged a fee under this section.  Money collected under this section may not be allocated to an emergency communication district not participating in the applicable regional plan.
    
    (e)  A service provider shall collect the fees imposed on its customers under this section.  Not later than the 30th day after the last day of the month in which the fees are collected, the service provider shall deliver the fees to the comptroller.  The comptroller shall deposit money from the fees to the credit of the 9-1-1 services fee account in the general revenue fund.  The comptroller may establish alternative dates for payment of fees under this section, provided that the required payment date be no earlier than the 30th day after the last day of the reporting period in which the fees are collected.
    
    (f)  The commission shall distribute money appropriated to the commission from the 9-1-1 services fee fund to regional planning commissions for use in providing 9-1-1 services as provided by contracts executed under Section [771.078](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=771.078).  The regional planning commissions shall distribute the money to public agencies for use in providing those services.

(a)  To provide for automatic number identification and automatic location identification of wireless 9-1-1 calls, the commission shall impose on each wireless telecommunications connection a 9-1-1 emergency service fee.  A political subdivision may not impose another fee on a wireless service provider or subscriber for 9-1-1 emergency service.
    
    (b)  A wireless service provider shall collect the fee in an amount equal to 50 cents a month for each wireless telecommunications connection from its subscribers and shall pay the money collected to the comptroller not later than the 30th day after the last day of the month during which the fees were collected.  The comptroller may establish alternative dates for payment of fees under this section.  The wireless service provider may retain an administrative fee of one percent of the amount collected.  The comptroller shall deposit the money from the fees to the credit of the 9-1-1 services fee account.  Until deposited to the credit of the 9-1-1 services fee account as required by Subsection (c), money the comptroller collects under this subsection remains in a trust fund with the state treasury.

The remaining money collected under Subsection (b) shall be deposited to the 9-1-1 services fee account.
    
    (d)  A service provider of telecommunications service involved in providing wireless 9-1-1 service is not liable for any claim, damage, or loss arising from the provision of wireless 9-1-1 service unless the act or omission proximately causing the claim, damage, or loss constitutes gross negligence, recklessness, or intentional misconduct.
    
    (e)  A member of the commission, the governing body of a public agency, or the Department of Information Resources is not liable for any claim, damage, or loss arising from the provision of wireless 9-1-1 service unless the act or omission causing the claim, damage, or loss violates a statute or ordinance applicable to the action.
    
    (f)  A wireless service provider is not required to take legal action to enforce the collection of any wireless 9-1-1 service fee.  The comptroller may establish collection procedures and recover the cost of collection from the subscriber liable for the fee.  The comptroller may institute legal proceedings to collect a fee and in those proceedings is entitled to recover from the subscriber court costs, attorney's fees, and interest on the amount delinquent.

    Sec. 771.073.  COLLECTION OF FEES AND SURCHARGES.  (a)  A customer on which a fee or surcharge is imposed under this subchapter is liable for the fee or surcharge in the same manner as the customer is liable for the charges for services provided by the service provider.  The service provider shall collect the fees and surcharges in the same manner it collects those charges for service, except that the service provider is not required to take legal action to enforce the collection of the fees or surcharges.  Other than the fee imposed under Section [771.0712](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=771.0712), a fee or surcharge imposed under this subchapter must be either stated separately on the customer's bill or combined in an appropriately labeled single line item on the customer's bill with all other fees and surcharges that are imposed under this subchapter or that are imposed for 9-1-1 emergency service by a political subdivision.  A service provider that combines the fees and surcharges into a single line item for billing purposes must maintain books and records reflecting the collection of each separate fee and surcharge.
    
    (b)  A business service user that provides residential facilities and owns or leases a private telephone switch used to provide telephone service to facility residents shall collect the 9-1-1 emergency service fee and transmit the fees monthly to the comptroller. A business service user that does not collect and remit the 9-1-1 emergency service fee as required is subject to a civil cause of action.  A court may award to the comptroller court costs, attorney's fees, and interest on the amount delinquent, to be paid by the nonpaying business service user.  A certificate of the comptroller specifying the unremitted fees is prima facie evidence that the fees were not remitted and of the amount of the unremitted fees.
    
    (c)  The comptroller may establish collection procedures and recover the cost of collection from the customer liable for the fee or surcharge.  The comptroller may institute legal proceedings to collect a fee or surcharge and in those proceedings is entitled to recover from the customer court costs, attorney's fees, and an interest on the amount delinquent.
    
    (d)  A service provider may not disconnect services for nonpayment of a fee or surcharge imposed under this subchapter.
    
    (e)  A service provider collecting fees or surcharges under this subchapter may retain as an administrative fee an amount equal to one percent of the total amount collected.
    
    (f)  The commission may establish payment schedules and minimum payment thresholds for fees and surcharges imposed under this subchapter.
    
    (g)  A 9-1-1 service provider is responsible for correctly billing and remitting applicable 9-1-1 fees, charges, and equalization surcharges.  Any 9-1-1 fees, charges, or equalization surcharges erroneously billed to a subscriber by a 9-1-1 service provider and erroneously remitted to the commission or an emergency communication district may not be recovered from the commission or emergency communication district unless the fees or charges were adjusted due to a refund to the subscriber by the local exchange carrier or interexchange carrier.
