The total amount of awards granted to all persons under this subsection concerning an application may not exceed $25,000.  In determining the appropriateness of the award, the commission shall consider whether:
    
    (1)  the evidence or analysis provided by the studies, reports, and witnesses is significant to the evaluation of the application; 
    
    (2)  the evidence or analysis would otherwise not have been provided in the proceeding;  and
    
    (3)  the local review committee was established in accordance with commission rules.
    
    (g)  Except as provided by Subsection (k), if an applicant has not entered into a local review committee process, the commission, in determining the appropriateness of an award of costs under Subsection (f), shall waive any requirement that the person affected has participated in a local review committee process.
    
    (h)  Except as provided by Subsection (k), costs awarded by the commission under Subsection (f) are assessed against the applicant.  Rules shall be adopted for the award of those costs.

    (2)  produce a fact-finding report documenting resolved and unresolved issues and unanswered questions.
    
    (j)  The applicant must submit the report required under Subsection (i)(2) to the commission with its permit application.
    
    (k)  If an applicant, after reasonable efforts to determine if local opposition exists to its proposed facility, including discussing the proposed facility with the county judge and other elected officials, does not enter into a local review committee process because of no apparent opposition or because a local review committee is not established despite the applicant's good faith efforts, costs may not be assessed against the applicant under Subsection (f).
    
    (l)  This section does not apply to:
    
    (1)  a solid waste or hazardous waste management facility for which an application was filed, or that was authorized to operate, as of September 1, 1985;

That information may include balance sheets, financial statements, and disclosure of relevant information regarding investors and stockholders, or information required by Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 264, Subpart H. If the information would be considered confidential under applicable law, the commission shall protect the information accordingly.  During hearings on contested applications, the commission may allow disclosure of confidential information only under an appropriate protective order.
    
    (b)  The commission may order a party in a contested case permit hearing to provide:

    (d)  Before hazardous waste may be received for storage, processing, or disposal at a solid waste facility for which a permit is issued, amended, extended, or renewed, the commission shall require the permit holder to execute the required financial assurance conditioned on the permit holder's satisfactorily operating and closing the solid waste facility.
    
    (e)  The commission may condition issuance, amendment, extension, or renewal of a permit for a solid waste facility, other than a solid waste facility for disposal of hazardous waste, on the permit holder's executing a bond or giving other financial assurance conditioned on the permit holder's satisfactorily operating and closing the solid waste facility.
    
    (f)  The commission shall require an assurance of financial responsibility as may be necessary or desirable consistent with the degree and duration of risks associated with the processing, storage, or disposal of specified solid waste.
    
    (g)  Financial requirements established by the commission must at a minimum be consistent with the federal requirements established under the federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (42 U.S.C. Section 6901 et seq.).
    
    (h)  The commission may:
    
    (1)  receive funds as the beneficiary of a financial assurance arrangement established under this section for the proper closure of a solid waste management facility;  and
    
    (2)  spend the funds from the financial assurance arrangement to close the facility.

    (j)  In addition to other forms of financial assurance authorized by rules of the commission, the commission may authorize the applicant to use a letter of credit if the issuing institution or another institution that guarantees payment under the letter is:
    
    (1)  a bank chartered by the state or the federal government;  and
    
    (2)  federally insured and its financial practices are regulated by the state or the federal government.
    
    (k)  The commission may require financial assurance as a condition of issuing a permit or registration for the collection, transportation, or processing of grit trap waste or grease trap waste.  The amount of financial assurance required must be consistent with the degree and duration of risk associated with the type of waste authorized to be collected, transported, or processed.
    
    (l)  If the commission requires financial assurance as a condition of a permit or registration under Subsection (k), provision of that financial assurance also satisfies any requirement for financial assurance under Chapter [368](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=368).

    Sec. 361.182.  INVESTIGATIONS.  (a)  The executive director may conduct investigations of facilities that are listed on the state registry, or that the executive director has reason to believe should be included on the state registry, in accordance with Sections [361.032](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=361.032), [361.033](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=361.033), and [361.037](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=361.037).
    
    (b)  If there is a reasonable basis to believe there may be a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance at a facility, the executive director may submit requests for information and requests for the production of documents to any person who has or may have information or documents relevant to:
    
    (1)  the identification, nature, or quantity of materials that have been generated, treated, stored, or disposed of at a facility or transported to a facility;
    
    (2)  the identification of soils, groundwater, or surface water at a facility that have been or may be affected by an actual or threatened release of a hazardous substance;

    Sec. 361.183.  REGISTRY LISTING PROCEDURE:  DETERMINATION OF ELIGIBILITY.  (a)  Before listing a facility on the state registry, the executive director shall determine whether the potential endangerment to public health and safety or the environment at the facility can be resolved by:
    
    (1)  the present owner or operator under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (42 U.S.C. Section 6901);
    
    (2)  some or all of the potentially responsible parties identified in Subchapter I, under an agreed administrative order issued by the commission;  or
    
    (3)  an agreement under Subchapter S, as added by Chapter 986, Acts of the 74th Legislature, Regular Session, 1995.
    
    (b)  If the potential endangerment to public health and safety or the environment can be resolved in such a manner, the facility may not be listed on the state registry.  Notice of the approach selected to resolve the apparent endangerment to public health and safety or the environment and the fact that this action is being taken in lieu of listing the facility on the state registry shall be published in the Texas Register.
    
    (c)  If after reasonable efforts the executive director determines that the potential endangerment to public health and safety or the environment cannot be resolved by either of the approaches under Subsection (a), the executive director shall evaluate the facility to determine whether the site exceeds the commission's minimum criteria for listing on the state registry.  The commission by rule shall adopt the minimum criteria.  The executive director shall also evaluate the facility to determine whether it is eligible for listing on the federal National Priorities List.
    
    (d)  The commission shall proceed under this subchapter only if, based on information available to the executive director, the facility is eligible for listing on the state registry but not eligible for the federal National Priorities List.

    Sec. 361.184.  REGISTRY LISTING PROCEDURE:  NOTICES AND HEARING.  (a)  If the executive director determines that a facility is eligible for listing on the state registry, the commission shall publish in the Texas Register and in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the facility is located a notice of intent to list the facility on the state registry.  The notice shall at least specify the name and location of the facility, the general nature of the potential endangerment to public health and safety or the environment as determined by information available to the executive director at that time, and the duties and restrictions imposed by Subsection (c).  The notice also shall provide that interested parties may do either or both of the following:
    
    (1)  submit written comments to the commission relative to the proposed listing of the facility;  or
    
    (2)  request a public meeting to discuss the proposed listing by submitting a request not later than the 30th day after the date on which the notice is issued.
    
    (b)  If the facility is determined to be eligible for listing on the state registry, the executive director shall make all reasonable efforts to identify all potentially responsible parties for remediation of the facility.  Concurrent with the publication of general notice under Subsection (a), the executive director shall provide to each identified potentially responsible party direct, written notification of the proposed listing of the facility on the state registry and of the procedures for requesting a public meeting to discuss the listing and the information included in the general notice as required by Subsection (a).  Written notifications under this subsection shall be by certified mail, return receipt requested, to each named responsible party at the party's last known address.
    
    (c)  If a public meeting is requested regarding the proposed listing of a facility on the state registry, the commission shall publish general notice of the date, time, and location of the public meeting in the Texas Register and in the same newspaper in which the notice of the opportunity to request the public meeting was published.  The public meeting notice shall be provided not later than the 31st day before the date of the meeting.  Notice of the meeting also shall be provided by certified mail, return receipt requested, to each identified potentially responsible party at the party's last known address.
    
    (d)  Nonreceipt of any notice mailed to a potentially responsible party under Subsection (b) or this subsection does not affect the responsibilities, duties, or liabilities imposed on the party.  Contemporaneously with issuing the notice of the public meeting, the executive director shall make available to all interested parties the public records the executive director has regarding the facility.  For the purposes of providing this information, the executive director shall provide a brief summary of those public records and make those public records available for inspection and copying during regular business hours.
    
    (e)  A public meeting is legislative in nature and not a contested case hearing under Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code.  The meeting shall be held for the purpose of obtaining additional information regarding the facility relative to the eligibility of the facility for listing on the state registry and the identification of potentially responsible parties.
    
    (f)  After the public meeting or after opportunity to request a public meeting has passed, the commission shall file or cause to be filed an affidavit or notice in the real property records of the county in which the facility is located identifying the facility as one proposed for listing on the state registry unless the executive director determines, based on information presented at the public meeting, that efforts to list the facility on the state registry should not be pursued.

    Sec. 361.185.  INVESTIGATION/FEASIBILITY STUDY.  (a)  After the public meeting or after opportunity to request a public meeting has passed, but before any listing of the facility on the state registry, the commission shall allow all identified potentially responsible parties the opportunity to fund or conduct, if appropriate, a remedial investigation/feasibility study, or a similar study as approved by the executive director, for the facility.  Not later than the 90th day after notice under Section [361.184](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=361.184)(a) is issued, the potentially responsible parties may make a good faith offer to conduct the study.  If a good faith offer from all or some of the potentially responsible parties is received by the commission within that period, those making the offer have an additional 60 days within which to negotiate an agreed administrative order from the commission, which must include a scope of work.  In the agreed administrative order the commission may not require the participating potentially responsible parties to agree to perform the remedial action or admit liability for the facility remediation.
    
    (b)  If no potentially responsible party makes a good faith offer to conduct the remedial investigation/feasibility study or similar study as approved by the executive director or if the participating potentially responsible parties fail to conduct or complete an approved study, the commission may conduct or complete the study using funds from the hazardous waste disposal fee fund.
    
    (c)  To encourage potentially responsible parties to perform the remedial investigation/feasibility study or other similar study as approved by the executive director, costs for commission oversight of the study may not be assessed against those parties who fund or perform the study.  Nonparticipating potentially responsible parties who are ultimately determined to be liable for remediation of the facility under this chapter or who subsequently enter into an agreed order relative to the remediation of the facility may be assessed up to the full costs for commission oversight of the study process.  If all potentially responsible parties participate or agree to fund the remedial investigation/feasibility study or other similar study, all commission oversight costs shall be paid from the hazardous waste disposal fee fund.

    Sec. 361.1855.  PROPOSAL OF LAND USE OTHER THAN RESIDENTIAL.  (a)  The executive director shall hold a public meeting to obtain public input and information regarding the appropriate use of land on which a facility is located that is the subject of a remedial investigation/feasibility study if:
    
    (1)  a land use other than residential is proposed as appropriate for the land by:
    
    (A)  the executive director;  or
    
    (B)  a potentially responsible party who has entered into an agreed order with the commission;
    
    (2)  the proposal is made before the study is completed;  and
    
    (3)  a local government has not zoned the land as residential only.
    
    (b)  Any interested person may comment at the meeting.
    
    (c)  The meeting is legislative in nature and not a contested case hearing under Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code.
    
    (d)  Not later than the 31st day before the date of the meeting, the commission shall:
    
    (1)  publish notice of the meeting in the Texas Register and in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the facility is located;
    
    (2)  mail notice of the meeting to each potentially responsible party by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the party's most recent address as shown on the records of the commission;  and
    
    (3)  make the commission's records regarding the facility available to any interested person.
    
    (e)  The notice shall:
    
    (1)  state the date, time, and place of the meeting;  and
    
    (2)  provide information regarding the proposed land use.
    
    (f)  The failure of a potentially responsible party to receive a notice under this section does not affect the responsibilities, duties, or liabilities of the party.
    
    (g)  After the meeting, the executive director shall select the appropriate land use for purposes of selecting a proposed remedial action.

    Sec. 361.186.  FACILITY ELIGIBLE FOR LISTING:  ACTIVITIES AND CHANGE OF USE.  (a)  If the executive director determines that a facility is eligible for listing on the state registry, a person may not perform at the facility any partial or total removal activities except as authorized by the executive director in appropriate circumstances after notice and opportunity for comment to all other potentially responsible parties.  The commission may adopt rules determining what constitutes an appropriate circumstance to take removal action under this subsection.  Authorization by the executive director to conduct a partial or total removal action does not constitute:
    
    (1)  a final determination of the party's ultimate liability for remediation of the facility;  or
    
    (2)  a determination of divisibility.
    
    (b)  If the facility is determined to be eligible for listing on the state registry, the owner or operator of the facility must provide the executive director with written notice of any substantial change in use of the facility before the 60th day before the date on which the change in use is made.  Notice of a proposed substantial change in use must be in writing, addressed to the executive director, sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, and include a brief description of the proposed change in use.  A substantial change in use shall be defined by rule and must include actions such as the erection of a building or other structure at the facility, the use of the facility for agricultural production, the paving of the facility for use as a roadway or parking lot, and the creation of a park or other public or private recreational use on the facility.
    
    (c)  If, within 30 days after the date of the notice, the executive director determines that the proposed substantial change in use will interfere significantly with a proposed or ongoing remedial investigation/feasibility study or similar study approved by the executive director or expose the public health and safety or the environment to a significantly increased threat of harm, the executive director shall notify the owner or operator of the determination.  After the determination is made and notification given, the owner or operator may not proceed with the proposed substantial change in use.  The owner or operator may request a hearing before the commission on whether the determination should be modified or set aside by submitting a request not later than the 30th day after the receipt of the executive director's determination.  If a hearing is requested, the commission shall initiate the hearing not later than the 45th day after the receipt of the request.  The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code.  The executive director's determination becomes unappealable on the 31st day after issuance if a hearing is not requested.

    Sec. 361.187.  PROPOSED REMEDIAL ACTION.  (a)  Within a reasonable time after the completion of the remedial investigation/feasibility study or other similar study, if required, the executive director shall select a proposed remedial action.  After the selection of a proposed remedial action, the commission shall hold a public meeting to discuss the proposed action.
    
    (b)  The commission shall publish notice of the meeting in the Texas Register and in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the facility is located at least 30 days before the date of the public meeting.  The notice shall provide information regarding the proposed remedial action and the date, time, and place of the meeting.  The commission shall also mail the same information to each potentially responsible party by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the party's last known address at least 30 days before the public meeting.  Contemporaneously with the issuance of notice of the public meeting, the executive director shall make available to all interested parties the public records the executive director has regarding the facility.  For purposes of providing this information, the executive director shall provide a brief summary of those public records and make those public records available for inspection and copying during regular business hours.  Nonreceipt of any notice mailed to a potentially responsible party under this section does not affect the responsibilities, duties, or liabilities imposed on the party.
    
    (c)  The public meeting is legislative in nature and not a contested case hearing under Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code.  The meeting shall be held for the purpose of obtaining additional information regarding the facility and the identification of additional potentially responsible parties.  Those in attendance may comment on the proposed remedial action, and the executive director may revise the proposed remedial action in light of the presentations.
    
    (d)  After the public meeting on the proposed remedial action, the commission shall provide all identified potentially responsible parties an opportunity to fund or perform the proposed remedial action.  Not later than the 60th day after the date of the public meeting, the potentially responsible parties may make a good faith offer to fund or perform the proposed remedial action.  If a good faith offer is made by all or some of the potentially responsible parties within this period, those parties have an additional 60 days to negotiate an agreed administrative order from the commission, which shall include a scope of work.  The commission may not require an admission of liability in the agreed administrative order.
    
    (e)  To encourage potentially responsible parties to perform the remedial action, costs for commission oversight of the remedial action may not be assessed against those parties who fund or perform the remedial action.  Nonparticipating potentially responsible parties who are ultimately determined to be liable for remediation of the facility may be assessed up to the full costs for commission oversight of the remedial action.  If all potentially responsible parties conduct or fund the remedial action, all commission oversight costs shall be paid from the hazardous waste disposal fee fund.  Participation in the remedial action does not relieve those who did not conduct or fund the remedial investigation/feasibility study or other similar study approved by the executive director from paying their portion of the oversight costs of that phase of the remediation.
    
    (f)  The executive director may authorize a potentially responsible party to conduct a partial remedial action at a portion of the facility if after notice and opportunity for comment to all other potentially responsible parties the executive director determines that the release or threatened release is divisible.  In this subchapter, "divisible" means that the hazardous substance released or threatened to be released is capable of being managed separately under the remedial action plan.  A determination of divisibility by the executive director does not have res judicata or collateral estoppel effect on a potentially responsible party's ultimate liability for remediation of the facility under Subchapter G or I.

    Sec. 361.189.  DELETIONS FROM REGISTRY.  (a)  The executive director or an owner or operator or other named responsible party of a facility listed or to be listed on the state registry may request the commission to delete the facility from the state registry, modify the facility's priority within the state registry, or modify any information regarding the facility by submitting a written statement setting forth the grounds of the request in the form the commission may by rule require.

    Sec. 361.191.  IMMEDIATE REMOVAL.  (a)  If the commission, after investigation, finds that there exists a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance at a facility that is causing irreversible or irreparable harm to the public health and safety or the environment and that the immediacy of the situation makes it prejudicial to the public interest to delay action until an administrative order can be issued to potentially responsible parties or until a judgment can be entered in an appeal of an administrative order, the commission may, with the funds available to the commission from the hazardous waste disposal fee fund, undertake immediate removal action at the facility to alleviate the harm.
    
    (b)  After the immediate danger of irreversible or irreparable harm has been alleviated, the commission shall proceed under this subchapter.
    
    (c)  Findings required under this section must be in writing and may be made ex parte by the commission subject to judicial review under the substantial evidence rule as provided by Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code.

    Sec. 361.192.  REMEDIAL ACTION BY COMMISSION.  (a)  If a person ordered to eliminate an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health and safety or the environment has failed to do so within the time limits specified in the order or any extension of time approved by the commission, the commission may implement the remedial action program for the facility.
    
    (b)  The reasonable expenses of implementing the remedial action program by the commission shall be paid by the persons to whom the order was issued and shall be recoverable under Section [361.197](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=361.197).

    Sec. 361.193.  GOAL OF REMEDIAL ACTION.  (a)  The goal of any remedial action is the elimination of the imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health and safety or the environment posed by a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance at a facility.  The appropriate extent of the remedial action at any particular facility shall be determined by the commission's selection of the remedial alternative that the commission determines is the lowest cost alternative that is technologically feasible and reliable and that effectively mitigates and minimizes damage to and provides adequate protection of the public health and safety or the environment.
    
    (b)  In considering the appropriate remedial action program at a particular facility, the commission may approve a program that does not attain a level or standard of control at least equivalent to a legally applicable or relevant and appropriate standard, requirement, criterion, or limitation, as required by state or local law, if the commission finds that:
    
    (1)  the remedial action selected is only part of a total remedial action that will attain that level or standard of control when completed;
    
    (2)  compliance with the requirement at that facility will result in greater risk to public health and safety or the environment than alternative options;
    
    (3)  compliance with the requirement is technically impracticable from an engineering perspective;
    
    (4)  the remedial action selected will attain a standard of performance that is equivalent to that required under the otherwise applicable standard, requirement, criterion, or limitation through use of another method or approach;
    
    (5)  with respect to a local standard, requirement, criterion, or limitation, the locality has not consistently applied or demonstrated the intention to consistently apply the standard, requirement, criterion, or limitation in similar circumstances of other remedial actions within the locality;  or
    
    (6)  with respect to an action using solely state funds, selection of a remedial action that attains those levels or standards of control will not provide a balance between the need for protection of public health and safety or the environment at the facility and the availability of state funds to respond to other sites that present a threat to public health and safety or the environment, taking into consideration the relative immediacy of the threats.

    Sec. 361.194.  LIEN.  (a)  In addition to all other remedies available to the state under this chapter or other law, all remediation costs for which a person is liable to the state constitute a lien in favor of the state on the real property and the rights to the real property that are subject to or affected by a remedial action.  This provision is cumulative of other remedies available to the state under this chapter.
    
    (b)  The lien imposed by this section arises and attaches to the real property subject to or affected by a remedial action at the time an affidavit is recorded and indexed in accordance with this section in the county in which the real property is located. For the purpose of determining rights of all affected parties, the lien does not relate back to a time before the date on which the affidavit is recorded, which date is the lien inception date.  The lien continues until the liability for the costs is satisfied or becomes unenforceable through operation of law.  The executive director shall determine whether to prepare an affidavit.  In determining whether to prepare an affidavit or whether a lien is satisfied, the executive director:
    
    (1)  shall proceed in the manner that the executive director determines will most likely result in the least overall costs to the state after any cost recovery action;  and
    
    (2)  may take into account a landowner's financial ability to satisfy the lien, including consideration of whether the landowner received financial compensation for the disposal of any substance addressed by the remedial action and whether the real property that is the subject of the lien:
    
    (A)  is a homestead and is being occupied as a home by the landowner;  and
    
    (B)  has a fair market value of $250,000 or less.
    
    (c)  An authorized representative of the commission must execute the affidavit.  The affidavit must show:
    
    (1)  the names and addresses of the persons liable for the costs;
    
    (2)  a description of the real property that is subject to or affected by the remediation action for the costs or claims;  and
    
    (3)  the amount of the costs and the balance due.
    
    (d)  The county clerk shall record the affidavit in records kept for that purpose and shall index the affidavit under the names of the persons liable for the costs.
    
    (e)  The commission shall record a relinquishment or satisfaction of the lien when the lien is paid or satisfied.
    
    (f)  The lien may be foreclosed only on judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction foreclosing the lien and ordering the sale of the property subject to the lien.
    
    (g)  The lien imposed by this section is not valid or enforceable if real property, an interest in real property, or a mortgage, lien, or other encumbrance on or against real property is acquired before the affidavit is recorded, unless the person acquiring the real property, an interest in the property, or the mortgage, lien, or other encumbrance on the property had or reasonably should have had actual notice or knowledge that the real property is subject to or affected by a clean-up action or has knowledge that the state has incurred clean-up costs.
    
    (h)  If a lien is fixed or attempted to be fixed as provided by this section, the owner of the real property affected by the lien may file a bond to indemnify against the lien.  The bond must be filed with the county clerk of the county in which the real property subject to the lien is located.  An action to establish, enforce, or foreclose any lien or claim of lien covered by the bond must be brought not later than the 30th day after the date of service of notice of the bond.  The bond must:
    
    (1)  describe the real property on which the lien is claimed;
    
    (2)  refer to the lien claimed in a manner sufficient to identify it;
    
    (3)  be in an amount double the amount of the lien referred to;
    
    (4)  be payable to the commission;
    
    (5)  be executed by the party filing the bond as principal and a corporate surety authorized under the law of this state to execute the bond as surety;  and
    
    (6)  be conditioned substantially that the principal and sureties will pay to the commission the amount of the lien claimed, plus costs, if the claim is proved to be a lien on the real property.
    
    (i)  After the bond is filed, the county clerk shall issue notice of the bond to the named obligee.  A copy of the bond must be attached to the notice.  The notice may be served on each obligee by having a copy delivered to the obligee by any person competent to make oath of the delivery.  The original notice shall be returned to the office of the county clerk, and the person making service of copy shall make an oath on the back of the copies showing on whom and on what date the copies were served.  The county clerk shall record the bond notice and return in records kept for that purpose.  In acquiring an interest in real property, a purchaser or lender may rely on and is absolutely protected by the record of the bond, notice, and return.
    
    (j)  The commission may sue on the bond after the 30th day after the date on which the notice is served but may not sue on the bond later than one year after the date on which the notice is served.  The commission is entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees if the commission recovers in a suit on the lien or on the bond.

    (b)  Subject to Section [361.193](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=361.193), the state may enforce any federal or state standard, requirement, criterion, or limitation to which the remedial action would otherwise be required to conform if a permit were required.
    
    (c)  An action taken by the person to contain or remove a release or threatened release in accordance with an approved remedial action plan may not be construed as an admission of liability for the release or threatened release.
    
    (d)  A person who renders assistance in containing or removing a release or threatened release in accordance with an approved remedial action plan is not liable for any additional remediation costs at the facility resulting solely from acts or omissions of the person in rendering the assistance in compliance with the approvals required by this section, unless the remediation costs were caused by the person's gross negligence or wilful misconduct.
    
    (e)  Except as specifically provided by this section, these provisions do not expand or diminish the common law tort liability, if any, of private parties participating in a remediation action for civil damages to third parties.

The commission shall file the cost recovery action no later than one year after all remedial action has been completed.
    
    (b)  The state may seek a judgment against the noncompliant parties for the total amount of the cost of the remedial investigation and feasibility study, the remedial design, and the remedial action, including costs of any necessary studies and oversight costs, minus the amount agreed to be paid or expended by any other responsible parties under an order issued under Section [361.185](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=361.185) or [361.188](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=361.188).
    
    (c)  The action may also include a plea seeking civil penalties for noncompliance with the commission's administrative order and a claim for up to triple the state's costs if the responsible party's defenses are determined by the court to be unreasonable, frivolous, or without foundation.
    
    (d)  The commission shall file a cost recovery action against each responsible party for the total costs of an action taken under Section [361.133](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=361.133)(c)(1), (2), (3), (5), or (6) or Section [361.133](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=361.133)(g).

The commission by rule shall adopt the criteria for determination of financial capability.
    
    (b)  If no financially capable, potentially responsible parties exist for a facility, the commission shall issue an administrative order stating its determination that the facility constitutes an imminent and substantial endangerment and that there are no financially capable, potentially responsible parties.  The commission shall then conduct its own remediation study and remedial action, using federal funds if available, or, if federal funds are not available, using state funds from the hazardous and solid waste remediation fee account.

    (1)  the port authority or navigation district is acting by virtue of the authority's or district's function as sovereign;
    
    (2)  the port authority or navigation district requires that dredged materials be sampled and analyzed before placement or storage of those materials on land or submerged land; and
    
    (3)  the port authority or navigation district, after exercising due diligence, does not accept dredged materials that are hazardous waste.
    
    (h)  Subsection (g) may not be construed to relieve a port authority or navigation district of liability if the port authority or navigation district causes or contributes to the generation of hazardous waste.
    
    (i)  As used in Subsection (g), activities related to construction or maintenance of waterways to facilitate navigation include:
    
    (1)  the dredging of materials from navigable waters or the banks of navigable waters;

    Sec. 361.275.  DEFENSES.  (a)  Except as provided by Section [361.2755](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=361.2755), a person responsible for solid waste under Section [361.271](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=361.271) is liable under Section [361.272](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=361.272) or [361.273](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=361.273) unless the person can establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the release or threatened release was caused solely by:
    
    (1)  an act of God;
    
    (2)  an act of war;
    
    (3)  an act or omission of a third person; or
    
    (4)  any combination of Subdivisions (1), (2), and (3). 
    
    (b)  In a defense under Subsection (a)(3), the defendant must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant:
    
    (1)  exercised due care concerning the solid waste, considering the characteristics of the solid waste, in light of all relevant facts and circumstances;  and
    
    (2)  took precautions against foreseeable acts or omissions of the third person and the consequences that could foreseeably result from those acts or omissions.
    
    (c)  The defense under Subsection (a)(3) does not apply if the third person:
    
    (1)  is an employee or agent of the defendant;  or
    
    (2)  has a direct or indirect contractual relationship with the defendant and the act or omission of the third person occurred in connection with the contractual relationship.
    
    (d)  In Subsection (c)(2), "contractual relationship" includes land contracts, deeds, or other instruments transferring title or possession of real property.
    
    (e)  A defendant who enters into a contractual relationship as provided by Subsection (c)(2) is not liable under this subchapter if:
    
    (1)  the sole contractual relationship is acceptance for rail carriage by a common carrier under a published tariff;  or
    
    (2)  the defendant acquired the real property on which the facility requiring the remedial action is located, after the disposal or placement of the hazardous substance on, in, or at the facility and the defendant establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that:
    
    (A)  the defendant has satisfied Subsection (b); 
    
    (B)  at the time the defendant acquired the facility the defendant did not know and had no reason to know that a hazardous substance that is the subject of the release or threatened release was disposed of on, in, or at the facility; 
    
    (C)  the defendant is a governmental entity that acquired the facility by escheat, by other involuntary transfer or acquisition, or by the exercise of the power of eminent domain;  or
    
    (D)  the defendant acquired the facility by inheritance or bequest.
    
    (f)  To demonstrate the condition under Subsection (e)(2)(B), the defendant must have made, at the time of acquisition, appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses of the property consistent with good commercial or customary practice in an effort to minimize liability. In deciding whether the defendant meets this condition, the court shall consider:
    
    (1)  any specialized knowledge or experience of the defendant; 
    
    (2)  the relationship of the purchase price to the value of the property if the property were uncontaminated; 
    
    (3)  commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the property; 
    
    (4)  the obvious presence or likely presence of contamination of the property;  and
    
    (5)  the defendant's ability to detect the contamination by appropriate inspection.
    
    (g)  This section does not decrease the liability of a previous owner or operator of a facility who is liable under this chapter. If the defendant obtained actual knowledge of the release or threatened release of a hazardous substance at a facility at the time the defendant owned the real property on which the facility is located and subsequently transferred ownership of the property to another person without disclosing that knowledge, the defendant is liable and a defense under this section is not available to the defendant.
    
    (h)  Subsections (e)-(g) do not affect the liability under this chapter of a defendant who, by an act or omission, caused or contributed to the release or threatened release of a hazardous substance that is the subject of the action concerning the facility.

    (g)  For purposes of Subsection (f)(1), an objectively reasonable basis for belief shall be determined using criteria that include:
    
    (1)  the size of the person's business;

(a)  Any person subject to an administrative order under Section [361.272](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=361.272) may appeal the order by filing a petition in the time required by Section [5.351](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=5.351), Water Code.

    (c)  The filing of a motion for rehearing under Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code is not a prerequisite for an appeal of the order.
    
    (d)  The person appealing the order must join the commission as a party and may join as parties any other person named as a responsible party in the administrative order and any other person who is or may be liable for the elimination of the actual or threatened release of solid waste or hazardous substances governed by the administrative order.
    
    (e)  The filing of the petition does not prevent the commission from proceeding with the remedial action program under Subchapter F  unless the court enjoins the remedial action under its general equity jurisdiction.
    
    (f)  The administrative order is final as to a nonappealing party on the date by which the person is required to file a petition under Section [5.351](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=5.351), Water Code.

    (1)  there is an actual or threatened release of solid waste or hazardous substances that is an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health and safety or the environment;  and
    
    (2)  the person made subject to the administrative order is liable for the elimination of the release or threatened release, in whole or in part.
    
    (h)  If the appropriateness of the selected remedial action is contested in the appeal of the administrative order, the remedial action shall be upheld unless the court determines that the remedy is arbitrary or unreasonable.
    
    (i)  A person made a party to the appeal may join as a party any other person who is or may be liable for the elimination of the release or threatened release, but the failure by a party to file an action for contribution or indemnity does not waive any right under this chapter or other law.
    
    (j)  In an appeal under this section, the district court on establishing the validity of the order shall issue an injunction requiring any person named or joined against whom liability has been established by the commission or other party to comply with the order.
    
    (k)  As between parties determined to be liable under Subchapter I, the court may, as equity requires, apportion cleanup costs in accordance with Section [361.343](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=361.343) and grant any other appropriate relief.

    (1)  the relationship between the parties' actions in storing, processing, and disposing of solid waste and the remedy required to eliminate the release or threatened release; 
    
    (2)  the volume of solid waste each party is responsible for at the solid waste facility or site to the extent that the costs of the remedy are based on the volume of solid waste present;

    (c)  The apportionment of costs only adjusts the rights of parties identified by Section [361.271](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=361.271) and does not affect a person's liability to the state.

This right is in addition to the right to file an action for contribution, indemnity, or both in an appeal proceeding or in an action brought by the attorney general.

    (1)  in the county in which the release or threatened release is or was located;  or

    SUBCHAPTER N. WASTE REDUCTION PROGRAMS;  DISPOSAL FEES
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 361.421.  DEFINITIONS.  In this subchapter:
    
    (1)  "Compost" is the disinfected and stabilized product of the decomposition process that is used or sold for use as a soil amendment, artificial top soil, growing medium amendment, or other similar uses.
    
    (2)  "Composting" means the controlled biological decomposition of organic materials through microbial activity.  Depending on the specific application, composting can serve as both a volume reduction and a waste treatment measure.  A beneficial organic composting activity is an appropriate waste management solution that shall divert compatible materials from the solid waste stream that cannot be recycled into higher grade uses and convert these materials into a useful product that is put to beneficial reuse as a soil amendment or mulch.
    
    (3)  "Life-cycle cost benefit analysis" means a method of determining the total equivalent costs and benefits of using products over their lifetimes or over any other period of time.  These costs and benefits are all associated costs and all associated benefits of each product over the time under consideration and include initial costs, annual operating costs, annual savings, future costs, and residual (salvage) values.  The use of this method permits exact comparisons of these total costs and benefits to determine the most cost-effective product.
    
    (4)  "Postconsumer waste" means a material or product that has served its intended use and has been discarded after passing through the hands of a final user.  For the purpose of this subchapter, the term does not include industrial or hazardous waste.
    
    (5)  "Recyclable material" means material that can be or has been recovered or diverted from the waste stream for purposes of reuse, recycling, or reclamation, a substantial portion of which is consistently used in the manufacture of products which may otherwise be produced using raw or virgin materials.  The term includes any waste stream, including post-use polymers and recoverable feedstocks that are converted through pyrolysis, gasification, solvolysis, or depolymerization into valuable raw materials or valuable intermediate and final products.  Recyclable material is not solid waste unless the material is deemed to be hazardous solid waste by the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, whereupon it shall be regulated accordingly unless it is otherwise exempted in whole or in part from regulation under the federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (42 U.S.C. Section 6901 et seq.), by Environmental Protection Agency regulation.  However, recyclable material may become solid waste at such time, if any, as it is abandoned or disposed of rather than recycled, whereupon it will be solid waste with respect only to the party actually abandoning or disposing of the material.
    
    (6)  "Recycled material" means materials, goods, or products that consist of recovered recyclable material or materials derived from recoverable feedstocks, post-use polymers, postconsumer waste, industrial waste, or hazardous waste which may be used in place of a raw or virgin material in manufacturing a new product or that are certified under a third-party certification system for mass balance attribution identified by the commission under Section [361.4215](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=361.4215).  The term includes recycled plastics.
    
    (6-a)  "Recycled plastics" means products that are produced from:
    
    (A)  mechanical recycling of post-use polymers; or
    
    (B)  nonmechanical recycling of recoverable feedstocks or post-use polymers that are certified under a third-party certification system for mass balance attribution identified by the commission under Section [361.4215](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=361.4215).
    
    (7)  "Recycled product" means a product that is eligible to be considered a recycled product under the rules established by the commission under Section [361.427](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=361.427).  The term does not include a product sold as fuel.
    
    (8)  "Recycling" means a process by which materials that have served their intended use or are scrapped, discarded, used, surplus, or obsolete are collected, separated, or processed and returned to use in the form of raw materials or feedstocks used in the manufacture of new products.  The term does not include incineration of plastics or waste-to-energy processes.  Recycling includes:
    
    (A)  the composting process if the compost material is put to beneficial reuse as defined by the commission;
    
    (B)  the application to land, as organic fertilizer, of processed sludge or biosolids from municipal wastewater treatment plants and other organic matter resulting from poultry, dairy, livestock, or other agricultural operations; and
    
    (C)  the conversion of post-use polymers and recoverable feedstocks through pyrolysis, gasification, solvolysis, or depolymerization.
    
    (9)  "Source reduction" means an activity or process that avoids the creation of municipal solid waste in the state by reducing waste at the source and includes:
    
    (A)  redesigning a product or packaging so that less material is ultimately disposed of;
    
    (B)  changing a process for producing a good or providing a service so that less material is disposed of;  or
    
    (C)  changing the way a material is used so that the amount of waste generated is reduced.
    
    (10)  "State agency" means a department, commission, board, office, council, or other agency in the executive branch of government that is created by the constitution or a statute of this state and has authority not limited to a geographical portion of the state.  The term does not include a university system or institution of higher education as defined by Section [61.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=61.003), Education Code.
    
    (11)  "Virgin material" means a raw material used in manufacturing that has not yet become a product.
    
    (12)  "Yard waste" means leaves, grass clippings, yard and garden debris, and brush, including clean woody vegetative material not greater than six inches in diameter, that results from landscaping maintenance and land-clearing operations.  The term does not include stumps, roots, or shrubs with intact root balls.

    Sec. 361.422.  STATE SOURCE REDUCTION AND RECYCLING GOAL.  (a)  It is the state's goal to reduce by January 1, 1994, the amount of municipal solid waste disposed of in this state by at least 40 percent through source reduction and recycling.
    
    (b)  In this section, "total municipal solid waste stream" means the sum of the state's total municipal solid waste that is disposed of as solid waste, measured in tons, and the total number of tons of recyclable material that has been diverted or recovered from the total municipal solid waste and recycled.
    
    (c)  The commission shall establish rules and reporting requirements through which progress toward achieving the established source reduction and recycling goals can be measured.  The rules may take into consideration those ongoing community source reduction and recycling programs where substantial progress has already been achieved.  The commission may also establish a limit on the amount of credit that may be given to certain high-volume materials in measuring recycling progress.
    
    (d)  For the purpose of measuring progress toward the municipal solid waste reduction goal, the commission shall use the weight of the total municipal solid waste stream in 1991 as a baseline for comparison.  To compute progress toward the municipal solid waste reduction goal for a year, the commission shall compare the total number of tons disposed in the year under comparison, either by landfilling or by other disposal methods, to the total number of tons disposed in the base year, adjusting for changes in population, tons of solid waste imported and exported, and other relevant changes between the baseline year and the comparison year.
    
    (e)  Before January 1, 1994, the commission shall determine whether the goal established in Subsection (a) is being achieved.  If the commission finds that the goal is not being achieved, it shall convene an advisory task force consisting of representatives of the commission, local governments, the Municipal Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery Advisory Council, and the commercial solid waste disposal industry and may recommend to the legislature a phased-in ban on the disposal of yard waste in a landfill.  The task force may recommend a plan to the legislature for implementing the ban after considering how the ban will:
    
    (1)  affect the state's disposal capacity;
    
    (2)  affect the economy of the state;
    
    (3)  affect local governments;  and
    
    (4)  be accepted and adhered to by the citizens of the state.

    Sec. 361.430.  NEWSPRINT RECYCLING PROGRAM.  (a)  It is the policy of this state that recycling of all paper products including old newspapers is vital to our economy and the preservation of our environment.  It is the purpose of this section to promote the state's policy by encouraging newspaper publishers to promote recycling through purchase of recycled products and by cooperating with local community organizations to establish and promote community collection efforts for all paper products.  
    
    (b)(1) In order to observe and promote this policy the newspaper publishers of Texas will work with state officials and state agencies to identify potential sites and offer economic incentives in order to attract additional de-inking facilities and recycled newsprint mills to Texas.
    
    (2)  The newspaper publishers of Texas will also assist and participate in the market development study and implementation program established by Section [361.423](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=361.423).
    
    (c)  The commission shall promulgate rules and regulations which establish a newsprint recycling program for the state.
    
    (d)  The program shall include guidelines which set goals for the use of recycled newsprint by newspaper publishers, using the following target percentages of recycled newsprint in the total newsprint consumption of each newspaper publisher:
    
    (1)  10 percent by the end of the calendar year 1993;
    
    (2)  20 percent by the end of the calendar year 1997;  and
    
    (3)  30 percent by the end of the calendar year 2000.
    
    (e)  Smaller newspapers may find it difficult to implement use of recycled newsprint.  Therefore, larger newspapers will be responsible for the necessary consumption to allow the percentages specified in Subsection (d) to represent total consumption of recycled newsprint by all Texas newspapers.
    
    (f)  In this section:
    
    (1)  "Newspaper" means a publication that is sold and that is printed on newsprint and published, printed, and distributed in the state, both daily and non-daily, to disseminate current news and information of general interest to the public.
    
    (2)  "Recycled newsprint" means newsprint which meets the specified guidelines under Section [361.427](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=361.427) to be classified as a recycled product.
    
    (g)(1) Publishers of newspapers subject to regulation under the newsprint recycling program shall submit annually, on or before January 31, a report to the executive director which states the percentage of recycled newsprint used by the publisher in the preceding year, and, if the target percentage is not met, the publisher must include in the report:
    
    (A)  whether the publisher is able to obtain sufficient quantities of recycled newsprint at competitive prices and of satisfactory quality;
    
    (B)  whether the publisher has attempted to obtain recycled newsprint from every producer of recycled newsprint that offered to sell recycled newsprint to the publisher during the preceding calendar year;  and
    
    (C)  the publisher's efforts to obtain recycled newsprint, including the name and address of each producer of recycled newsprint that the publisher contacted and the name and telephone number of the contact person at each of the producers.
    
    (2)  The executive director shall develop forms for and regulations governing the submission of the reports required by this subsection.
    
    (h)  If the executive director determines that newspaper publishers are not voluntarily meeting the target percentages prescribed by this section for the program, the commission may adopt mandatory enforcement measures.
