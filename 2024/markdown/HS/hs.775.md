    (b)  If the municipality's governing body does not consent to inclusion within the 60-day period prescribed by Subsection (a), a majority of the qualified voters and the owners of at least 50 percent of the territory in the municipality's limits or extraterritorial jurisdiction that would have been included in the district may petition the governing body to make fire control and emergency medical and ambulance services available.  The petition must be submitted to the governing body not later than the 90th day after the date on which the municipality receives the request under Subsection (a).
    
    (c)  If the municipality's governing body refuses or fails to act on the petition requesting fire protection and emergency medical and ambulance services within six months after the date on which the petition submitted under Subsection (b) is received, the governing body's refusal or failure to act constitutes consent for the territory that is the subject of the petition to be included in the proposed district.

    (e)  If the municipality's governing body consents to inclusion of territory within its limits or extraterritorial jurisdiction, or in an industrial district, the territory may be included in the district in the same manner as other territory is included under this chapter.
    
    (f)  A governing body's consent to include territory in the district and to initiate proceedings to create a district as prescribed by this chapter expires six months after the date on which the consent is given.

    (c)  The board, at its discretion, may hold a hearing to consider the exclusion of the territory.
    
    (d)  The board shall hold a hearing to consider the exclusion of the territory if the board receives a petition requesting a hearing on the issue that is signed by at least five percent of the qualified voters who own taxable real property in the district.  A petition submitted under this subsection must describe the proposed new boundaries of the district or describe the boundaries of the territory to be excluded from the district.
    
    (e)  The board shall issue a notice of a hearing to be held under Subsection (c) or (d). The provisions of Section [775.015](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=775.015) relating to the procedure for issuing notice of a hearing to create the district apply to the notice for the hearing under this section.

    (1)  the proposed new boundaries of the district or of the territory to be excluded;
    
    (2)  the time and place of the hearing;  and

    (f)  After the hearing the board either may order an election on the question of the exclusion of the territory or may declare by resolution the territory excluded from the district.  However, the board may not declare the territory as excluded if the owners of at least three percent of the property located in the district protest the exclusion.
    
    (g)  If the board excludes the territory by resolution, the board shall state in the resolution the new boundaries of the district.  The board shall file a copy of the resolution in the office of the county clerk of each county in which the district is located.  The county clerk of each affected county shall record the resolution in the county records.  After the resolution is recorded, the excluded territory is no longer a part of the district.
    
    (h)  The board shall order an election on the question of exclusion if:
    
    (1)  the owners of at least three percent of the property located in the district protest the exclusion;  or
    
    (2)  the board:
    
    (A)  despite the lack of a protest, refuses to exclude the territory;  and
    
    (B)  after refusing to exclude the territory, receives a petition requesting an election that is signed by a majority of the qualified voters who own taxable real property in the territory proposed to be excluded.
    
    (i)  Except as otherwise required by the Election Code, the election notice, the manner and time of giving the notice, and the manner of holding the election are governed by the applicable provisions of this chapter relating to the original election to create the district.
    
    (j)  If a majority of the voters voting in the election favor excluding the territory from the district, the board shall enter an order declaring the territory excluded from the district and stating the new boundaries of the district.  The board shall file a copy of the order in the office of the county clerk of each county in which the district is located.  The county clerk of each affected county shall record the order in the county records.  After the order is recorded, the excluded territory is no longer a part of the district.
    
    (k)  If a majority of the voters voting in the election do not favor excluding the territory, the board may not act on a petition to exclude all or part of the territory until the first anniversary of the date of the most recent election to exclude the territory from the district.
    
    (l)  The exclusion of territory under this section does not diminish or impair the rights of the holders of any outstanding and unpaid bonds, warrants, or other obligations of the district.
    
    (m)  Territory excluded under this section is not released from the payment of its pro rata share of the district's indebtedness.  The district shall continue to levy taxes each year on the excluded territory at the same rate levied on territory in the district until the taxes collected from the excluded territory equal its pro rata share of the indebtedness of the district at the time the territory was excluded.  The taxes collected under this subsection shall be applied exclusively to the payment of the excluded territory's pro rata share of the indebtedness.  The owner of all or part of the excluded territory may pay in full, at any time, the owner's share of the pro rata share of the district's indebtedness.

    Sec. 775.022.  REMOVAL OF TERRITORY BY MUNICIPALITY.  (a)  If a municipality completes all other procedures necessary to annex territory in a district and if the municipality intends to remove the territory from the district and be the sole provider of emergency services to the territory by the use of municipal personnel or by some method other than by use of the district, the municipality shall send written notice of those facts to the board.  The municipality must send the notice to the secretary of the board by certified mail, return receipt requested.  The territory remains part of the district and does not become part of the municipality until the secretary of the board receives the notice.  On receipt of the notice, the board shall immediately change its records to show that the territory has been disannexed from the district and shall cease to provide further services to the residents of that territory.  This subsection does not require a municipality to remove from a district territory the municipality has annexed.
    
    (b)  The disannexation of territory under this section does not diminish or impair the rights of the holders of any outstanding and unpaid bonds, warrants, or other obligations of the district including loans and lease-purchase agreements.
    
    (c)  If a municipality removes territory from a district that the municipality has annexed, the municipality shall compensate the district immediately after disannexation of the territory under Subsection (a) in an amount equal to the annexed territory's pro rata share of the district's bonded and other indebtedness as computed according to the formula in Subsection (e) or (e-1), whichever yields the greater amount.  The district shall apply compensation received from a municipality under this subsection exclusively to the payment of the annexed territory's pro rata share of the district's bonded and other indebtedness.
    
    (d)  On the district's request, a municipality shall purchase from the district at fair market value any real or personal property used to provide emergency services in territory disannexed under this section.
    
    (e)  Unless Subsection (e-1) would yield a greater amount, the amount of compensation under Subsection (c) shall be determined by multiplying the district's total indebtedness at the time of the annexation by a fraction the numerator of which is the assessed value of the property to be annexed based on the most recent certified county property tax rolls at the time of annexation and the denominator of which is the total assessed value of the property of the district based on the most recent certified county property tax rolls at the time of annexation.
    
    (e-1)  Unless Subsection (e) would yield a greater amount, the amount of compensation under Subsection (c) shall be determined by multiplying the district's total indebtedness at the time of the annexation by a fraction:
    
    (1)  the numerator of which is the assessed value of the property to be annexed based on the most recent certified county property tax rolls at the time of annexation plus the total amount of the district's sales and use tax revenue collected by retailers located in the property to be annexed in the 12 months preceding the date of annexation, as reported by the comptroller; and
    
    (2)  the denominator of which is the total assessed value of the property of the district based on the most recent certified county property tax rolls at the time of annexation plus the total amount of the district's sales and use tax revenue collected by retailers located in the district in the 12 months preceding the date of annexation, as reported by the comptroller.
    
    (f)  For purposes of this section, total indebtedness includes loans and lease-purchase agreements but does not include:
    
    (1)  a loan or lease-purchase agreement the district enters into after the district receives notice of the municipality's intent to annex district territory;  or
    
    (2)  any indebtedness attributed to any real or personal property that the district requires a municipality to purchase under Subsection (d).
    
    (g)  The amount of compensation under Subsection (c) shall be determined under Subsection (e) regardless of whether Subsection (e-1) would yield a greater amount if:
    
    (1)  the municipality has a population of more than one million and the majority of the territory inside the municipality's corporate boundaries is located inside a county with a population of less than 2.1 million; and
    
    (2)  the municipality and the district enter into an agreement on or before September 1, 2019, regarding the district's bonded and other indebtedness.

The remaining person on the list shall be appointed as the arbitrator.  In this subsection, "business day" means a day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or state or national holiday.
    
    (d)  The arbitrator shall:
    
    (1)  set a hearing to be held not later than the 10th day after the date the arbitrator is appointed;  and

    (c)  On request by the municipality, in connection with a disannexation under Subsection (b), the board shall immediately disannex all territory in the district that is included in the municipality's extraterritorial jurisdiction and shall cease to provide further services to the residents of such additional territory.
    
    (d)  The disannexation of territory under this section does not diminish or impair the rights of the holders of any outstanding and unpaid bonds, warrants, or other obligations of the district.
    
    (e)  If territory is disannexed under this section, the municipality shall compensate the district in an amount equal to the disannexed territory's pro rata share of the district's indebtedness at the time the territory is disannexed.  The district shall apply compensation received from a municipality under this subsection exclusively to the payment of the disannexed territory's pro rata share of the district's indebtedness.
    
    (f)  On the district's request, a municipality shall purchase from the district at fair market value any real or personal property used to provide emergency services in territory disannexed under this section.

    (c-1)  The number of initial emergency services commissioners on a board described by Subsection (c)(2) is not required to be five.
    
    (d)  The ballot for the election to approve a consolidation shall be printed to permit voting for or against the proposition:  "The consolidation of the _________ (insert district names) to create the _______________ (insert name of proposed district), which assumes all outstanding debts of the existing districts."

(a)  The board shall hold a hearing to consider the exclusion from the district of territory in a planned community if the board receives a petition requesting a hearing on the issue that is signed by at least five percent of the qualified voters residing in the territory proposed to be excluded from the district.  A petition submitted under this subsection must describe the boundaries of the territory to be excluded from the district.
    
    (b)  The board shall give notice of a hearing under this section.  The procedure under Section [775.015](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=775.015) for issuing notice of a hearing to create the district applies to the notice under this section.

    (1)  the boundaries of the territory proposed to be excluded;
    
    (2)  the time and place of the hearing;  and
    
    (3)  that each person who has an interest in the exclusion or nonexclusion of the territory may attend the hearing and present the person's opinion for or against the exclusion of the territory.
    
    (c)  After the hearing, if the board finds that the entity responsible for administering and collecting the ad valorem or annual variable budget based assessments in the territory to be excluded provides or contracts for the provision of substantially the same services as provided by the district, the board shall:
    
    (1)  order an election on the question of exclusion; or
    
    (2)  declare by resolution the territory excluded from the district.

    (e)  In a resolution excluding territory, the board shall describe the new boundaries of the district.
    
    (f)  The board shall order an election in the territory proposed to be excluded on the question of exclusion if:
    
    (1)  at least three percent of the qualified voters residing in the territory to be excluded protest the exclusion in writing at the hearing;  or
    
    (2)  the board:
    
    (A)  despite the lack of a sufficient protest, refuses to exclude the territory;  and
    
    (B)  not later than the 90th day after refusing to exclude the territory, receives a petition requesting an election that is signed by at least 10 percent of the qualified voters residing in the territory proposed to be excluded.
    
    (g)  Except as otherwise provided by the Election Code, the provisions of this chapter relating to the election creating the district apply to the election notice, the manner and time of giving the notice, and the manner of holding the election under this section.
    
    (h)  For purposes of the election, the order calling the election shall divide the territory proposed to be excluded from the district into one or more precincts.

    (j)  The board shall file a copy of a resolution or order with the county clerk of each county in which the district is located.  Each county clerk shall record the resolution or order.  After the resolution or order is recorded, the excluded territory is no longer part of the district.
    
    (k)  If a majority of the votes in the election are against excluding the territory, the board may not act on a petition to exclude all or any part of the territory before the first anniversary of the date of the most recent election to exclude the territory.
    
    (l)  The exclusion of territory under this section does not diminish or impair the rights of the holders of any outstanding and unpaid bonds, warrants, or other district obligations.  The district shall continue to impose taxes each year on the excluded territory at the same rate imposed on other territory in the district until the total amount of taxes collected from the excluded territory equals its pro rata share of the indebtedness of the district at the time the territory was excluded.  The taxes collected under this subsection shall be applied only to the payment of the excluded territory's pro rata share of indebtedness.  The owner of all or part of the excluded territory at any time may pay in full the owner's share of the excluded territory's pro rata share of the district's indebtedness at the time the territory was excluded.
    
    (m)  On or after the date on which the appropriate county clerk records the resolution or order excluding the territory from the district, the district or a fire department or ambulance service that contracts with the district is not required to provide to the excluded territory emergency service facilities, emergency services, or other services to protect the life and health of residents in the territory.
    
    (n)  For purposes of Subsection (o)(1), land ownership that is separated only by the claim of title by the state to the beds and banks of rivers or streams is considered contiguous.  Land ownership that is separated by a farm-to-market road right-of-way, whether fee simple ownership or an easement, is not considered contiguous.

Revenue from the tax may be used for any purpose for which ad valorem tax revenue of the district may be used.

    (2)  not later than the 30th day after the date on which the board issues the election order, gives, for informational purposes, written or oral notice on the proposed imposition, increase, or abolition of the sales and use tax, including the reasons for the proposed change, to the commissioners court of each county in which the district is located.
    
    (d)  If the voters of a district approve the adoption of the tax or an increase in the tax rate at an election held on the same election date on which another political subdivision of this state adopts a sales and use tax or approves the increase in the rate of its sales and use tax and as a result the combined rate of all sales and use taxes imposed by the district and other political subdivisions of this state having territory in the portion of the district in which the district sales and use tax will apply would exceed two percent at any location in that portion of the district, the election to adopt a sales and use tax or to increase the rate of the sales and use tax in the district under this subchapter has no effect.
