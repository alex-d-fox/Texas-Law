    (1)  restrict the number of visitors a patient receiving care or treatment at the hospital may receive to not fewer than one;
    
    (2)  require a visitor to the hospital to:

    (2)  notify the person who receives the daily update required under Subdivision (1) of the estimated date and time at which the patient will be discharged from the hospital.
    
    (i)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a hospital may not prohibit in-person visitation by a religious counselor with a patient who is receiving care or treatment at the hospital and who is seriously ill or dying for a reason other than the religious counselor's failure to comply with a requirement described by Subsection (c)(2).
    
    (j)  In the event of a conflict between this section and any provision of a qualifying official disaster order, this section prevails.
    
    (k)  This section does not create a cause of action against a hospital or physician.

    (2)  request the court to stay enforcement of the penalty by:

    (2)  is under the substantial evidence rule.
    
    (o)  If the court sustains the occurrence of the violation, the court may uphold or reduce the amount of the penalty and order the person to pay the full or reduced amount of the penalty.  If the court does not sustain the occurrence of the violation, the court shall order that no penalty is owed.
    
    (p)  When the judgment of the court becomes final, the court shall proceed under this subsection.  If the person paid the amount of the penalty and if that amount is reduced or is not upheld by the court, the court shall order that the appropriate amount plus accrued interest be remitted to the person within 30 days after the judgment of the court becomes final.  The rate of the interest is the rate charged on loans to depository institutions by the New York Federal Reserve Bank, and the interest shall be paid for the period beginning on the date the penalty was paid and ending on the date the penalty is remitted.  If the person gave a supersedeas bond and if the amount of the penalty is not upheld by the court, the court shall order the release of the bond.  If the person gave a supersedeas bond and if the amount of the penalty is reduced, the court shall order the release of the bond after the person pays the amount.
    
    (q)  A penalty collected under this section shall be remitted to the comptroller for deposit in the general revenue fund.

    (k)  Within the 30-day period, a person who acts under Subsection (j)(3) may:

    (2)  request the court to stay enforcement of the penalty by:
    
    (A)  filing with the court a sworn affidavit of the person stating that the person is financially unable to pay the amount of the penalty and is financially unable to give the supersedeas bond; and
    
    (B)  giving a copy of the affidavit to the commissioner by certified mail.
    
    (l)  The department on receipt of a copy of an affidavit under Subsection (k)(2) may file with the court within five days after the date the copy is received a contest to the affidavit.

    (2)  is under the substantial evidence rule.
    
    (o)  If the court sustains the occurrence of the violation, the court may uphold or reduce the amount of the penalty and order the person to pay the full or reduced amount of the penalty.  If the court does not sustain the occurrence of the violation, the court shall order that no penalty is owed.
    
    (p)  When the judgment of the court becomes final, the court shall proceed under this subsection.  If the person paid the amount of the penalty and if that amount is reduced or is not upheld by the court, the court shall order that the appropriate amount plus accrued interest be remitted to the person.  The rate of the interest is the rate charged on loans to depository institutions by the New York Federal Reserve Bank, and the interest shall be paid for the period beginning on the date the penalty was paid and ending on the date the penalty is remitted.  If the person gave a supersedeas bond and if the amount of the penalty is not upheld by the court, the court shall order the release of the bond.  If the person gave a supersedeas bond and if the amount of the penalty is reduced, the court shall order the release of the bond after the person pays the amount.
    
    (q)  A penalty collected under this section shall be remitted to the comptroller for deposit in the general revenue fund.
    
    (r)  All proceedings under this section are subject to Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code.

(a)  The governing body of a hospital is authorized to establish policies concerning the granting of clinical privileges to advanced practice nurses and physician assistants, including policies relating to the application process, reasonable qualifications for privileges, and the process for renewal, modification, or revocation of privileges.
    
    (b)  If the governing body of a hospital has adopted a policy of granting clinical privileges to advanced practice nurses or physician assistants, an individual advanced practice nurse or physician assistant who qualifies for privileges under that policy shall be entitled to certain procedural rights to provide fairness of process, as determined by the governing body of the hospital, when an application for privileges is submitted to the hospital.  At a minimum, any policy adopted shall specify a reasonable period for the processing and consideration of the application and shall provide for written notification to the applicant of any final action on the application by the hospital, including any reason for denial or restriction of the privileges requested.
    
    (c)  If an advanced practice nurse or physician assistant has been granted clinical privileges by a hospital, the hospital may not modify or revoke those privileges without providing certain procedural rights to provide fairness of process, as determined by the governing body of the hospital, to the advanced practice nurse or physician assistant.

Once the hospital receives such notice from an advanced practice nurse or physician assistant and the physician, the hospital shall be deemed to have met its obligations under this section by notifying the advanced practice nurse or physician assistant in writing that the advanced practice nurse's or physician assistant's clinical privileges no longer exist at that hospital.
