    (1)  the client, or the person legally responsible for the client's support, owns property; or
    
    (2)  the client received or is receiving services.
    
    (e)  The notice must contain:

    (A)  the local authority's state-mandated conversion from an ICF-IID program to a Section 1915(c) waiver program allowing for a permanent increase in the local authority's provider capacity in accordance with the number of persons who choose the local authority as their provider;
    
    (B)  the local authority's voluntary conversion from an ICF-IID program to a Section 1915(c) waiver program allowing for a temporary increase in the local authority's provider capacity, to be reduced by attrition, in accordance with the number of persons who choose the local authority as their provider;
    
    (C)  the local authority's refinancing from services funded solely by state general revenue to a Medicaid program allowing for a temporary increase in the local authority's provider capacity, to be reduced by attrition, in accordance with the number of persons who choose the local authority as their provider; or

    (e)  Any increase based on extenuating circumstances under Subsection (d)(2)(D) is considered a temporary increase in the local intellectual and developmental disability authority's provider capacity, to be reduced by attrition.
    
    (f)  At least biennially, the department shall review and determine the local intellectual and developmental disability authority's status as a qualified service provider in accordance with criteria that includes the consideration of the local authority's ability to assure the availability of services in its area, including:
