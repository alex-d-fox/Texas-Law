    (1)  a hospital maintained or operated by a state agency that has a contract with the county to provide health care services;
    
    (2)  a federally qualified health center delivering federally qualified health center services, as those terms are defined in 42 U.S.C. Sections 1396d(l)(2)(A) and (B), that has a contract with the county to provide health care services; or

    Sec. 61.037.  COUNTY ELIGIBILITY FOR STATE ASSISTANCE.  (a)  The department may distribute funds as provided by this subchapter to eligible counties to assist the counties in providing health care services under Sections [61.028](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=61.028) and [61.0285](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=61.0285) to their eligible county residents.
    
    (b)  Except as provided by Subsection (c), (d), (e), or (g), to be eligible for state assistance, a county must:
    
    (1)  spend in a state fiscal year at least eight percent of the county general revenue levy for that year to provide health care services described by Subsection (a) to its eligible county residents who qualify for assistance under Section [61.023](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=61.023);  and
    
    (2)  notify the department, not later than the seventh day after the date on which the county reaches the expenditure level, that the county has spent at least six percent of the applicable county general revenue levy for that year to provide health care services described by Subsection (a) to its eligible county residents who qualify for assistance under Section [61.023](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=61.023).
    
    (c)  If a county and a health care provider signed a contract on or before January 1, 1985, under which the provider agrees to furnish a certain level of health care services to indigent persons, the value of services furnished in a state fiscal year under the contract is included as part of the computation of a county expenditure under this section if the value of services does not exceed the payment rate established by the department under Section [61.006](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=61.006).
    
    (d)  If a hospital district is located in part but not all of a county, that county's appraisal district shall determine the taxable value of the property located inside the county but outside the hospital district.  In determining eligibility for state assistance, that county shall consider only the county general revenue levy resulting from the property located outside the hospital district.  A county is eligible for state assistance if:
    
    (1)  the county spends in a state fiscal year at least eight percent of the county general revenue levy for that year resulting from the property located outside the hospital district to provide health care services described by Subsection (a) to its eligible county residents who qualify for assistance under Section [61.023](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=61.023);  and
    
    (2)  the county complies with the other requirements of this subchapter.
    
    (e)  A county that provides health care services described by Subsection (a) to its eligible residents through a hospital established by a board of managers jointly appointed by a county and a municipality under Section [265.011](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=265.011) is eligible for state assistance if:
    
    (1)  the county spends in a state fiscal year at least eight percent of the county general revenue levy for the year to provide the health care services to its eligible county residents who qualify for assistance under Section [61.052](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=61.052);  and
    
    (2)  the county complies with the requirements of this subchapter.
    
    (f)  If a county anticipates that it will reach the eight percent expenditure level, the county must notify the department as soon as possible before the anticipated date on which the county will reach the level.
    
    (g)  The department may waive the requirement that the county meet the minimum expenditure level imposed by Subsection (b), (d), or (e) and provide state assistance under this chapter at a lower level determined by the department if the county demonstrates, through an appropriate actuarial analysis, that the county is unable to satisfy the eight percent expenditure level:
    
    (1)  because, although the county's general revenue tax levy has increased significantly, expenditures for health care services described by Subsection (a) have not increased by the same percentage;
    
    (2)  because the county is at the maximum allowable ad valorem tax rate, has a small population, or has insufficient taxable property;  or
    
    (3)  because of a similar reason.
    
    (h)  The executive commissioner shall adopt rules governing the circumstances under which a waiver may be granted under Subsection (g) and the procedures to be used by a county to apply for the waiver.  The procedures must provide that the department shall make a determination with respect to an application for a waiver not later than the 90th day after the date the application is submitted to the department in accordance with the procedures established by department rule.  To be eligible for state assistance under Subsection (g), a county must submit monthly financial reports, in the form required by the department, covering the 12-month period preceding the date on which the assistance is sought.
    
    (i)  The county must give the department all necessary information so that the department can determine if the county meets the requirements of Subsection (b), (d), (e), or (g).

    (b)  For the purposes of this subchapter, a hospital is not considered to be a public hospital and is not responsible for providing care under this subchapter if the hospital:
    
    (1)  is owned, operated, or leased by a municipality with a population of less than 5,500;
    
    (2)  was leased before January 1, 1981, by a municipality that at the time of the lease did not have a legal obligation to provide indigent health care;  or

    (1)  the basic income and resources requirements established by the department under Sections [61.006](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=61.006) and [61.008](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=61.008) and in effect when the assistance is requested;  or
    
    (2)  a less restrictive income and resources standard adopted by the hospital or hospital district serving the area in which the person resides.
    
    (b)  If a public hospital used an income and resources standard during the operating year that ended before January 1, 1985, that was less restrictive than the income and resources requirements established by the department under Section [61.006](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=61.006), the hospital shall adopt that standard to determine eligibility under this subchapter.
    
    (c)  If a public hospital did not use an income and resources standard during the operating year that ended before January 1, 1985, but had a Hill-Burton obligation during part of that year, the hospital shall adopt the standard the hospital used to meet the Hill-Burton obligation to determine eligibility under this subchapter.
    
    (d)  A public hospital established after September 1, 1985, shall provide health care services to each resident who meets the income and resources requirements established by the department under Sections [61.006](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=61.006) and [61.008](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=61.008), or the hospital may adopt a less restrictive income and resources standard.

    (e)  If because of a change in the income and resources requirements established by the department under Sections [61.006](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=61.006) and [61.008](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=61.008) the standard adopted by a public hospital or hospital district becomes stricter than the requirements established by the department, the hospital or hospital district shall change its standard to at least comply with the requirements established by the department.
    
    (f)  A public hospital or hospital district may contract with the department to perform eligibility determination services.
