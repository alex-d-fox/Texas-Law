    (5)  permit the delivery of a controlled substance to any person not known to the pharmacist, the pharmacist intern, or the person authorized by the pharmacist to deliver the controlled substance without first requiring identification of the person taking possession of the controlled substance, except as provided by Subsection (n).
    
    (b)  Except in an emergency as defined by board rule under Subsection (b-1) or as otherwise provided by Section [481.075](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=481.075)(j) or (m) or [481.0755](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=481.0755), a person may not dispense or administer a controlled substance without an electronic prescription that meets the requirements of and is completed by the practitioner in accordance with Section [481.075](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=481.075).
    
    (b-1)  In an emergency as defined by board rule, a person may dispense or administer a controlled substance on the oral or telephonically communicated prescription of a practitioner.  The person who administers or dispenses the substance shall:
    
    (1)  if the person is a prescribing practitioner or a pharmacist, promptly comply with Subsection (c); or
    
    (2)  if the person is not a prescribing practitioner or a pharmacist, promptly write the oral or telephonically communicated prescription and include in the written record of the prescription the name, address, and Federal Drug Enforcement Administration number issued for prescribing a controlled substance in this state of the prescribing practitioner, all information required to be provided by a practitioner under Section [481.075](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=481.075)(e)(1), and all information required to be provided by a dispensing pharmacist under Section [481.075](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=481.075)(e)(2).
    
    (b-2)  In an emergency described by Subsection (b-1), an agent designated in writing by a practitioner defined by Section [481.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=481.002)(39)(A) may communicate a prescription by telephone.  A practitioner who designates a different agent shall designate that agent in writing and maintain the designation in the same manner in which the practitioner initially designated an agent under this subsection.  On the request of a pharmacist, a practitioner shall furnish a copy of the written designation. This subsection does not relieve a practitioner or the practitioner's designated agent from the requirement of Subchapter [A](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=562.001), Chapter [562](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=562), Occupations Code.  A practitioner is personally responsible for the actions of the designated agent in communicating a prescription to a pharmacist.
    
    (c)  Not later than the seventh day after the date a prescribing practitioner authorizes an emergency oral or telephonically communicated prescription, the prescribing practitioner shall cause an electronic prescription, completed in the manner required by Section [481.075](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=481.075), to be delivered to the dispensing pharmacist at the pharmacy where the prescription was dispensed.   On receipt of the electronic prescription, the pharmacist shall annotate the electronic prescription record with the original authorization and date of the emergency oral or telephonically communicated prescription.
    
    (d)  Except as specified in Subsections (e) and (f), the board, by rule and in consultation with the Texas Medical Board, shall establish the period after the date on which the prescription is issued that a person may fill a prescription for a controlled substance listed in Schedule II.  A person may not refill a prescription for a substance listed in Schedule II.
    
    (d-1)  Notwithstanding Subsection (d), a prescribing practitioner may issue multiple prescriptions authorizing the patient to receive a total of up to a 90-day supply of a Schedule II controlled substance if:
    
    (1)  each separate prescription is issued for a legitimate medical purpose by a prescribing practitioner acting in the usual course of professional practice;
    
    (2)  the prescribing practitioner provides instructions on each prescription to be filled at a later date indicating the earliest date on which a pharmacy may fill each prescription;
    
    (3)  the prescribing practitioner concludes that providing the patient with multiple prescriptions in this manner does not create an undue risk of diversion or abuse; and
    
    (4)  the issuance of multiple prescriptions complies with other applicable state and federal laws.
    
    (e)  The partial filling of a prescription for a controlled substance listed in Schedule II is permissible in accordance with applicable federal law.
    
    (f)  A prescription for a Schedule II controlled substance for a patient in a long-term care facility (LTCF) or for a hospice patient with a medical diagnosis documenting a terminal illness may be filled in partial quantities to include individual dosage units.  If there is any question about whether a hospice patient may be classified as having a terminal illness, the pharmacist must contact the practitioner before partially filling the prescription.  Both the pharmacist and the practitioner have a corresponding responsibility to assure that the controlled substance is for a terminally ill hospice patient.  The pharmacist must record the prescription in the electronic prescription record and must indicate in the electronic prescription record whether the patient is a "terminally ill hospice patient" or an "LTCF patient."  A prescription that is partially filled and does not contain the notation "terminally ill hospice patient" or "LTCF patient" is considered to have been filled in violation of this chapter.  For each partial filling, the dispensing pharmacist shall record in the electronic prescription record the date of the partial filling, the quantity dispensed, the remaining quantity authorized to be dispensed, and the identification of the dispensing pharmacist.  Before any subsequent partial filling, the pharmacist must determine that the additional partial filling is necessary.  The total quantity of Schedule II controlled substances dispensed in all partial fillings may not exceed the total quantity prescribed.  Schedule II prescriptions for patients in a long-term care facility or hospice patients with a medical diagnosis documenting a terminal illness are valid for a period not to exceed 60 days following the issue date unless sooner terminated by discontinuance of the medication.
    
    (g)  A person may not dispense a controlled substance in Schedule III or IV that is a prescription drug under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. Section 301 et seq.) without a prescription of a practitioner defined by Section [481.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=481.002)(39)(A) or (D), except that the practitioner may dispense the substance directly to an ultimate user.  A prescription for a controlled substance listed in Schedule III or IV may not be filled or refilled later than six months after the date on which the prescription is issued and may not be refilled more than five times, unless the prescription is renewed by the practitioner.  A prescription under this subsection must comply with other applicable state and federal laws.
    
    (h)  A pharmacist may dispense a controlled substance listed in Schedule III, IV, or V under a prescription issued by a practitioner defined by Section [481.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=481.002)(39)(C) only if the pharmacist determines that the prescription was issued for a valid medical purpose and in the course of professional practice.  A prescription described by this subsection may not be filled or refilled later than six months after the date the prescription is issued and may not be refilled more than five times, unless the prescription is renewed by the practitioner.
    
    (i)  A person may not dispense a controlled substance listed in Schedule V and containing 200 milligrams or less of codeine, or any of its salts, per 100 milliliters or per 100 grams, or containing 100 milligrams or less of dihydrocodeine, or any of its salts, per 100 milliliters or per 100 grams, without the prescription of a practitioner defined by Section [481.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=481.002)(39)(A), except that a practitioner may dispense the substance directly to an ultimate user.  A prescription issued under this subsection may not be filled or refilled later than six months after the date the prescription is issued and may not be refilled more than five times, unless the prescription is renewed by the practitioner.
    
    (j)  A practitioner or institutional practitioner may not allow a patient, on the patient's release from the hospital, to possess a controlled substance prescribed by the practitioner unless:
    
    (1)  the substance was dispensed under a medication order while the patient was admitted to the hospital;
    
    (2)  the substance is in a properly labeled container;  and
    
    (3)  the patient possesses not more than a seven-day supply of the substance.
    
    (k)  A prescription for a controlled substance must show:
    
    (1)  the quantity of the substance prescribed:
    
    (A)   numerically, if the prescription is electronic; or
    
    (B)  if the prescription is communicated orally or telephonically, as transcribed by the receiving pharmacist;
    
    (2)  the date of issue;
    
    (2-a)  if the prescription is issued for a Schedule II controlled substance to be filled at a later date under Subsection (d-1), the earliest date on which a pharmacy may fill the prescription;
    
    (3)  the name, address, and date of birth or age of the patient or, if the controlled substance is prescribed for an animal, the species of the animal and the name and address of its owner;
    
    (4)  the name and strength of the controlled substance prescribed;
    
    (5)  the directions for use of the controlled substance;
    
    (6)  the intended use of the substance prescribed unless the practitioner determines the furnishing of this information is not in the best interest of the patient; and
    
    (7)  the name, address, Federal Drug Enforcement Administration number, and telephone number of the practitioner at the practitioner's usual place of business.
    
    (l)  A pharmacist may exercise his professional judgment in refilling a prescription for a controlled substance in Schedule III, IV, or V without the authorization of the prescribing practitioner provided:
    
    (1)  failure to refill the prescription might result in an interruption of a therapeutic regimen or create patient suffering;
    
    (2)  either:
    
    (A)  a natural or manmade disaster has occurred which prohibits the pharmacist from being able to contact the practitioner;  or
    
    (B)  the pharmacist is unable to contact the practitioner after reasonable effort;
    
    (3)  the quantity of prescription drug dispensed does not exceed a 72-hour supply;
    
    (4)  the pharmacist informs the patient or the patient's agent at the time of dispensing that the refill is being provided without such authorization and that authorization of the practitioner is required for future refills;  and

    (k)  The board by rule may develop guidelines identifying patterns that may indicate that a particular patient to whom a controlled substance is prescribed or dispensed is engaging in drug abuse or drug diversion.  These guidelines may be based on the frequency of prescriptions issued to and filled by the patient, the types of controlled substances prescribed, and the number of prescribers who prescribe controlled substances to the patient.  The board may, based on the guidelines developed under this subsection, send a prescriber or dispenser an electronic notification if there is reason to believe that a particular patient is engaging in drug abuse or drug diversion.

    (b)  The district court may not require the department to receive, analyze, or retain a controlled substance property or plant forfeited to a law enforcement agency other than the department.
    
    (c)  In order to ensure that a controlled substance property or plant is not diluted, substituted, diverted, or tampered with while being used in the investigation of offenses under this code, law enforcement agencies using the property or plant for this purpose shall:
    
    (1)  employ a qualified individual to conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses of the property or plant before and after their use in an investigation;
