    (1)  is made to address or correct a matter raised by the audit and is made only to:

A party having received information under Subsection (b) or (c) has the burden of proving that the evidence offered did not arise and was not derived from the review of privileged information.

    Sec. 1101.153.  BURDEN OF PROOF WITH RESPECT TO VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE.  (a)  In a civil or administrative enforcement action brought against a person for a violation for which the person claims to have made a voluntary disclosure, the person claiming the immunity created by this subchapter has the burden of establishing a prima facie case that the disclosure was voluntary.
    
    (b)  After the person claiming the immunity establishes a prima facie case of voluntary disclosure, other than a case in which immunity does not apply under Section [1101.157](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=1101.157), the enforcement authority has the burden of rebutting the presumption by a preponderance of the evidence.

(a)  The immunity established by this subchapter does not apply if a court or administrative law judge finds that the person claiming the immunity has, after May 23, 1995, repeatedly or continuously committed significant violations and not attempted to bring the facility or operation into compliance, so as to constitute a pattern of disregard of environmental or health and safety laws.
    
    (b)  For violations committed by a person to be considered a "pattern" under Subsection (a), the person must have committed a series of violations that were due to separate and distinct events occurring within a three-year period at the same facility or operation.
