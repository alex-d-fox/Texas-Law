    (b)  The board of managers of a district by order may require a service supplier or business service user to provide to the district any information the board requires so long as that information and the format requested are readily available for the service provider's records to determine whether the service provider or business service user is correctly billing and collecting the 9-1-1 emergency service fee and remitting the fee to the district.  The information required from a service provider under this subsection may include:
    
    (1)  the number of local exchange access lines that the service provider has in the district; and
    
    (2)  the number of those local exchange access lines that the Commission on State Emergency Communications excluded from the definition of a local exchange access line or an equivalent local exchange access line under Section [771.063](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=771.063).

    SUBCHAPTER B. EMERGENCY COMMUNICATION DISTRICTS:  COUNTIES WITH POPULATION OVER 3.3 MILLION
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 772.101.  SHORT TITLE.  This subchapter may be cited as the 9-1-1 Emergency Number Act.
    
    
    
    
    Acts 1989, 71st Leg., ch. 678, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1989.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 772.102.  PURPOSE.  It is the purpose of this subchapter to establish the number 9-1-1 as the primary emergency telephone number for use by certain local governments in this state and to encourage units of local government and combinations of the units to develop and improve emergency communication procedures and facilities in a manner that makes possible the quick response to any person calling the telephone number 9-1-1 seeking police, fire, medical, rescue, and other emergency services.  To this purpose the legislature finds that:
    
    (1)  it is in the public interest to shorten the time required for a citizen to request and receive emergency aid; 
    
    (2)  there exist thousands of different emergency telephone numbers throughout the state, and telephone exchange boundaries and central office service areas do not necessarily correspond to public safety and political boundaries; 
    
    (3)  a dominant part of the state's population is located in rapidly expanding metropolitan areas that generally cross the boundary lines of local jurisdictions and often extend into two or more counties;  and
    
    (4)  provision of a single, primary three-digit emergency number through which emergency services can be quickly and efficiently obtained would provide a significant contribution to law enforcement and other public safety efforts by making it less difficult to notify public safety personnel quickly.

    (e)  In imposing the fee, the board shall attempt to match the district's revenues to its operating expenditures and to provide reasonable reserves for contingencies and for the purchase and installation of 9-1-1 emergency service equipment.  If the revenue received from the fee exceeds the amount of money needed to fund the district, the board by resolution shall reduce the rate of the fee to an amount adequate to fund the district as required by this subsection or suspend the imposition of the fee.  If the board suspends the imposition of the fee, the board by resolution may reinstitute the fee if money received by the district is not adequate to fund the district.
    
    (f)  In a public agency whose governing body at a later date votes to receive 9-1-1 service from the district, at a later date, the fee is imposed beginning on the date specified by the board.  The board may charge the incoming agency an additional amount of money to cover the initial cost of providing 9-1-1 service to that agency.  The fee authorized to be charged in a district applies to new territory added to the district under Section [772.105](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=772.105)(b) when the territory becomes part of the district.

    Sec. 772.115.  COLLECTION OF FEE.  (a)  Each billed service user is liable for the fee imposed under Section [772.114](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=772.114) until the fee is paid to the service supplier.  The fee must be added to and stated separately in the service user's bill from the service supplier.  The service supplier shall collect the fee at the same time as the service charge to the service user in accordance with the regular billing practice of the service supplier.  A business service user that provides residential facilities and owns or leases a publicly or privately owned telephone switch used to provide telephone service to facility residents shall collect the 9-1-1 emergency service fee and transmit the fees monthly to the district.
    
    (b)  The amount collected by a service supplier from the fee is due quarterly.  The service supplier shall remit the amount collected in a calendar quarter to the district not later than the 60th day after the last day of the calendar quarter.  With each payment the service supplier shall file a return in a form prescribed by the board.
    
    (c)  Both a service supplier and a business service user under Subsection (a) shall maintain records of the amount of fees it collects for at least two years after the date of collection.  The board may require at the board's expense an annual audit of a service supplier's books and records or the books and records of a business service user described by Subsection (a) with respect to the collection and remittance of the fees.
    
    (d)  A business service user that does not collect and remit the 9-1-1 emergency service fee as required is subject to a civil cause of action under Subsection (g).  A sworn affidavit by the district specifying the unremitted fees is prima facie evidence that the fees were not remitted and of the amount of the unremitted fees.
    
    (e)  A service supplier is entitled to retain an administrative fee from the amount of fees it collects.  The amount of the administrative fee is two percent of the amount of fees it collects under this section.
    
    (f)  A service supplier is not required to take any legal action to enforce the collection of the 9-1-1 emergency service fee.  However, the service supplier shall provide the district with an annual certificate of delinquency that includes the amount of all delinquent fees and the name and address of each nonpaying service user.  The certificate of delinquency is prima facie evidence that a fee included in the certificate is delinquent.  A service user account is considered delinquent if the fee is not paid to the service supplier before the 31st day after the payment due date stated on the user's bill from the service supplier.
    
    (g)  The district may institute legal proceedings to collect fees not paid and may establish internal collection procedures and recover the cost of collection from the nonpaying service user.  If legal proceedings are established, the court may award the district court costs, attorney's fees, and interest to be paid by the nonpaying service user.  A delinquent fee accrues interest at an annual rate of 12 percent beginning on the date the payment becomes due.

The commissioners court of the county in which the principal part of the district was located shall assume the assets of the district and pay the district's debts.  If the district's assets are insufficient to retire all existing debts of the district on the date of dissolution, the commissioners court shall continue to impose the 9-1-1 service fee, and each service supplier shall continue to collect the fee for the commissioners court.  Proceeds from the imposition of the fee by the county after dissolution of the district may be used only to retire the outstanding debts of the district.
    
    (b)  The commissioners court shall retire the district's debts to the extent practicable according to the terms of the instruments creating the debts and the terms of the orders and resolutions authorizing creation of the debts.

    Sec. 772.201.  SHORT TITLE.  This subchapter may be cited as the Emergency Communication District Act.

    Sec. 772.202.  PURPOSE.  It is the purpose of this subchapter to establish the number 9-1-1 as the primary emergency telephone number for use by certain local governments in this state and to encourage units of local government and combinations of those units to develop and improve emergency communication procedures and facilities in a manner that will make possible the quick response to any person calling the telephone number 9-1-1 seeking police, fire, medical, rescue, and other emergency services.  To this purpose the legislature finds that:
    
    (1)  it is in the public interest to shorten the time required for a citizen to request and receive emergency aid; 
    
    (2)  there exist thousands of different emergency telephone numbers throughout the state, and telephone exchange boundaries and central office service areas do not necessarily correspond to public safety and political boundaries; 
    
    (3)  a dominant part of the state's population is located in rapidly expanding metropolitan areas that generally cross the boundary lines of local jurisdictions and often extend into two or more counties;  and
    
    (4)  provision of a single, primary three-digit emergency number through which emergency services can be quickly and efficiently obtained would provide a significant contribution to law enforcement and other public safety efforts by making it less difficult to notify public safety personnel quickly.

    (b)  The fee may be imposed only on the base rate charge or its equivalent, excluding charges for coin-operated telephone equipment.  The fee may not be imposed on more than 100 local exchange access lines or their equivalent for a single business entity at a single location, unless the lines are used by residents of the location.  The fee may also not be imposed on any line that the Advisory Commission on State Emergency Communications excluded from the definition of a local exchange access line or an equivalent local exchange access line pursuant to Section [771.063](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=771.063).  If a business service user provides residential facilities, each line that terminates at a residential unit and that is a communication link equivalent to a residential local exchange access line shall be charged the 9-1-1 emergency service fee.  The fee must have uniform application and must be imposed in each participating jurisdiction.
    
    (c)  The rate of the fee may not exceed six percent of the monthly base rate charged a service user by the principal service supplier in the participating jurisdiction.
    
    (d)  The board shall set the amount of the fee each year as part of the annual budget.  The board shall notify each service supplier of a change in the amount of the fee not later than the 91st day before the date the change takes effect.
    
    (e)  In imposing the fee, the board shall attempt to match the district's revenues to its operating expenditures and to provide reasonable reserves for contingencies and for the purchase and installation of 9-1-1 emergency service equipment.  If the revenue received from the fee exceeds the amount of money needed to fund the district, the board by resolution shall reduce the rate of the fee to an amount adequate to fund the district or suspend the imposition of the fee.  If the board suspends the imposition of the fee, the board by resolution may reinstitute the fee if money received by the district is not adequate to fund the district.
    
    (f)  In a public agency whose governing body at a later date votes to receive 9-1-1 service from the district, the fee is imposed beginning on the date the board approves making the public agency a participating jurisdiction.  The fee authorized to be charged in a district applies to new territory added to the district when the territory becomes part of the district.

(a)  Each billed service user is liable for the fee imposed under Section [772.214](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=772.214) until the fee is paid to the service supplier.  The fee must be added to and stated separately in the service user's bill from the service supplier.  The service supplier shall collect the fee at the same time as the service charge to the service user in accordance with the regular billing practice of the service supplier.  A business service user that provides residential facilities and owns or leases a publicly or privately owned telephone switch used to provide telephone service to facility residents shall collect the 9-1-1 emergency service fee and transmit the fees monthly to the district.
    
    (b)  The amount collected by a service supplier from the fee is due monthly.  The service supplier shall remit the amount collected in a calendar month to the district not later than the 60th day after the last day of the calendar month.  With each payment the service supplier shall file a return in a form prescribed by the board.
    
    (c)  Both a service supplier and a business service user under Subsection (a) shall maintain records of the amount of fees it collects for at least two years after the date of collection.

    (d)  A business service user that does not collect and remit the 9-1-1 emergency service fee as required is subject to a civil cause of action under Subsection (g).  A sworn affidavit by the district specifying the unremitted fees is prima facie evidence that the fees were not remitted and of the amount of the unremitted fees.
    
    (e)  A service supplier is entitled to retain an administrative fee from the amount of fees it collects.  The amount of the administrative fee is two percent of the amount of fees it collects under this section.
    
    (f)  A service supplier is not required to take any legal action to enforce the collection of the 9-1-1 emergency service fee.  However, the service supplier shall provide the district with an annual certificate of delinquency that includes the amount of all delinquent fees and the name and address of each nonpaying service user.  The certificate of delinquency is prima facie evidence that a fee included in the certificate is delinquent.  A service user account is considered delinquent if the fee is not paid to the service supplier before the 31st day after the payment due date stated on the user's bill from the service supplier.
    
    (g)  The district may institute legal proceedings to collect fees not paid and may establish internal collection procedures and recover the cost of collection from the nonpaying service user.  If the district prevails in legal proceedings instituted to collect a fee, the court may award the district court costs, attorney's fees, and interest in addition to other amounts recovered.  A delinquent fee accrues interest at an annual rate of 12 percent beginning on the date the payment becomes due.

    (e)  A business service user that owns or leases a publicly or privately owned telephone switch used to consolidate telephone services at two or more physical addresses shall provide a level of 9-1-1 service that identifies an accurate physical address and telephone number for each 9-1-1 call.  For purposes of this section, each floor of a multitenant building is a different physical address.
    
    (f)  A hotel, motel, or similar lodging facility that does not operate with a 24-hour, seven-day on-site telephone operator must use a system that furnishes the telephone number and location of the individual unit from which a 9-1-1 call is placed.

    SUBCHAPTER D. EMERGENCY COMMUNICATION DISTRICTS:  COUNTIES WITH POPULATION OVER 20,000
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 772.301.  SHORT TITLE.  This subchapter may be cited as the Emergency Telephone Number Act.
    
    
    
    
    Acts 1989, 71st Leg., ch. 678, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1989.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 772.302.  PURPOSE.  It is the purpose of this subchapter to establish the number 9-1-1 as the primary emergency telephone number for use by certain local governments in this state and to encourage units of local government and combinations of those units to develop and improve emergency communication procedures and facilities in a manner that will make possible the quick response to any person calling the telephone number 9-1-1 seeking police, fire, medical, rescue, and other emergency services.  To this purpose the legislature finds that:
    
    (1)  it is in the public interest to shorten the time required for a citizen to request and receive emergency aid; 
    
    (2)  there exist thousands of different emergency telephone numbers throughout the state, and telephone exchange boundaries and central office service areas do not necessarily correspond to public safety and political boundaries; 
    
    (3)  a dominant part of the state's population is located in rapidly expanding metropolitan areas that generally cross the boundary lines of local jurisdictions and often extend into two or more counties;  and
    
    (4)  provision of a single, primary three-digit emergency number through which emergency services can be quickly and efficiently obtained would provide a significant contribution to law enforcement and other public safety efforts by making it less difficult to notify public safety personnel quickly.

    (d)  If a municipality is removed under this section, the municipality shall compensate the district in an amount equal to the municipality's pro rata share of the district's indebtedness at the time the municipality is removed.  The district shall apply compensation received from a municipality under this subsection exclusively to the payment of the municipality's pro rata share of the district's indebtedness.

    (d)  The board shall set the amount of the fee each year as part of the annual budget.  The board shall notify each service supplier of a change in the amount of the fee not later than the 91st day before the date the change takes effect.
    
    (e)  In imposing the fee, the board shall attempt to match the district's revenues to its operating expenditures and to provide reasonable reserves for contingencies and for the purchase and installation of 9-1-1 emergency service equipment.  If the revenue generated by the fee exceeds the amount of money needed to fund the district, the board by resolution shall reduce the rate of the fee to an amount adequate to fund the district or suspend the imposition of the fee.

    Sec. 772.315.  COLLECTION OF FEE.  (a)  Each billed service user is liable for the fee imposed under Section [772.314](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=772.314) until the fee is paid to the service supplier.  The fee must be added to and stated separately in the service user's bill from the service supplier.  The service supplier shall collect the fee at the same time as the service charge to the service user in accordance with the regular billing practice of the service supplier.  A business service user that provides residential facilities and owns or leases a publicly or privately owned telephone switch used to provide telephone service to facility residents shall collect the 9-1-1 emergency service fee and transmit the fees monthly to the district.
    
    (b)  The amount collected by a service supplier from the fee is due monthly.  The service supplier shall remit the amount collected in a calendar month to the district not later than the 60th day after the last day of the calendar month.  With each payment the service supplier shall file a return in a form prescribed by the board.
    
    (c)  Both a service supplier and a business service user under Subsection (a) shall maintain records of the amount of fees it collects for at least two years after the date of collection.  The board may require at the board's expense an annual audit of a service supplier's books and records or the books and records of a business service user described by Subsection (a) with respect to the collection and remittance of the fees.
    
    (d)  A business service user that does not collect and remit the 9-1-1 emergency service fee as required is subject to a civil cause of action under Subsection (g).  A sworn affidavit by the district specifying the unremitted fees is prima facie evidence that the fees were not remitted and of the amount of the unremitted fees.
    
    (e)  A service supplier is entitled to retain an administrative fee from the amount of fees it collects.  The amount of the administrative fee is two percent of the amount of fees it collects under this section.
    
    (f)  A service supplier is not required to take any legal action to enforce the collection of the 9-1-1 emergency service fee.  However, the service supplier shall provide the district with an annual certificate of delinquency that includes the amount of all delinquent fees and the name and address of each nonpaying service user.  The certificate of delinquency is prima facie evidence that a fee included in the certificate is delinquent.  A service user account is considered delinquent if the fee is not paid to the service supplier before the 31st day after the payment due date stated on the user's bill from the service supplier.
    
    (g)  The district may institute legal proceedings to collect fees not paid and may establish internal collection procedures and recover the cost of collection from the nonpaying service user.  If the district prevails in legal proceedings instituted to collect a fee, the court may award the district court costs, attorney's fees, and interest in addition to other amounts recovered.  A delinquent fee accrues interest at an annual rate of 12 percent beginning on the date the payment becomes due.

    Sec. 772.516.  9-1-1 EMERGENCY SERVICE FEE.  (a)  The board may impose a 9-1-1 emergency service fee on service users in the district.
    
    (b)  The fee may be imposed only on the base rate charge or the charge's equivalent, excluding charges for coin-operated telephone equipment.  The fee may not be imposed on:
    
    (1)  more than 100 local exchange access lines or the lines' equivalent for a single business entity at a single location, unless the lines are used by residents of the location; or
    
    (2)  any line that the Commission on State Emergency Communications has excluded from the definition of a local exchange access line or equivalent local exchange access line under Section [771.063](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=771.063).
    
    (c)  If a business service user provides residential facilities, each line that terminates at a residential unit and is a communication link equivalent to a residential local exchange access line shall be charged the 9-1-1 emergency service fee.  The fee must have uniform application throughout the district and be imposed in each participating jurisdiction in the district.
    
    (d)  The rate of the fee may not exceed six percent of the monthly base rate the principal service supplier in the participating jurisdiction charges a service user.
    
    (e)  The board shall set the amount of the fee each year as part of the annual budget.  The board shall notify each service supplier of a change in the amount of the fee not later than the 91st day before the date the change takes effect.
    
    (f)  In imposing the fee, the board shall attempt to match the district's revenues to the district's operating expenditures and to provide reasonable reserves for contingencies and for the purchase and installation of 9-1-1 emergency service equipment.  If the revenue received from the fee exceeds the amount of money needed to fund the district, the board by resolution shall reduce the rate of the fee to an amount adequate to fund the district as required by this subsection or suspend the imposition of the fee.  If the board suspends the imposition of the fee, the board by resolution may reinstitute the fee if money received by the district is not adequate to fund the district.
    
    (g)  For a county or municipality whose governing body at a later date votes to receive 9-1-1 service from the district, the fee is imposed beginning on the date specified by the board.  The board may charge the incoming county or municipality an additional amount of money to cover the initial cost of providing 9-1-1 service to that county or municipality.  The fee authorized to be charged in a district applies to new territory added to the district under Section [772.506](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=772.506)(b) when the territory becomes part of the district.

    Sec. 772.517.  COLLECTION OF FEE.  (a)  Each billed service user is liable for the fee imposed under Section [772.516](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=772.516) until the fee is paid to the service supplier.  The fee must be added to and stated separately in the service user's bill from the service supplier.  The service supplier shall collect the fee at the same time as the service charge to the service user in accordance with the service supplier's regular billing practice.  A business service user that provides residential facilities and owns or leases a publicly or privately owned telephone switch used to provide telephone service to facility residents shall collect the 9-1-1 emergency service fee and transmit the fees monthly to the district.
    
    (b)  The amount collected by a service supplier from the fee is due quarterly.  The service supplier shall remit the amount collected in a calendar quarter to the district not later than the 60th day after the last day of the calendar quarter.  With each payment, the service supplier shall file a return in a form prescribed by the board.
    
    (c)  Both a service supplier and a business service user under Subsection (a) shall maintain records of the amount of fees the service supplier or business service user collects until at least the second anniversary of the date of collection.  The board may require, at the board's expense, an annual audit of the service supplier's or business service user's books and records with respect to the collection and remittance of the fees.
    
    (d)  A business service user that does not collect and remit the 9-1-1 emergency service fee as required is subject to a civil cause of action under Subsection (g).  A sworn affidavit by the district specifying the unremitted fees is prima facie evidence that the fees were not remitted and of the amount of the unremitted fees.
    
    (e)  A service supplier may retain an administrative fee of two percent of the amount of fees the service supplier collects under this section.
    
    (f)  A service supplier is not required to take any legal action to enforce the collection of the 9-1-1 emergency service fee.  The service supplier shall provide the district with an annual certificate of delinquency that includes the amount of all delinquent fees and the name and address of each nonpaying service user.  The certificate of delinquency is prima facie evidence that a fee included in the certificate is delinquent and of the amount of the delinquent fee.  A service user account is considered delinquent if the fee is not paid to the service supplier before the 31st day after the payment due date stated on the user's bill from the service supplier.
    
    (g)  The district may file legal proceedings against a service user to collect fees not paid by the service user and may establish internal collection procedures and recover the cost of collection from the nonpaying service user.  If legal proceedings are filed by the district, the court may award costs, attorney's fees, and interest to be paid by the nonpaying service user.  A delinquent fee accrues interest at the legal rate beginning on the date the payment becomes due.

    (b)  Not later than the 30th day after the last day of the month in which the fees are collected, the service supplier or business service user shall deliver the fees to the district in the manner determined by the district.  The district may establish an alternative date for payment of fees under this section, provided that the required payment date is not earlier than the 30th day after the last day of the report period in which the fees are collected.  The service supplier or business service user shall file with each payment to the district a receipt in the form prescribed by the district.
    
    (c)  Both a service supplier and a business service user under Subsection (a) shall maintain records of the amount of fees the service supplier or business service user collects until at least the second anniversary of the date of collection.

    (d)  A business service user that does not collect and remit the 9-1-1 emergency service fee as required is subject to a civil cause of action under Subsection (g).  A sworn affidavit by the district specifying the unremitted fees is prima facie evidence that the fees were not remitted and of the amount of the unremitted fees.
    
    (e)  A service supplier may retain an administrative fee of two percent of the amount of fees the service supplier collects under this section.

The service supplier shall provide the district with an annual certificate of delinquency that includes the amount of all delinquent fees and the name and address of each nonpaying service user.  The certificate of delinquency is prima facie evidence that a fee included in the certificate is delinquent and of the amount of the delinquent fee.  A service user account is considered delinquent if the fee is not paid to the service supplier before the 31st day after the payment due date stated on the user's bill from the service supplier.
    
    (g)  The district may file legal proceedings against a service user to collect fees not paid by the service user and may establish internal collection procedures and recover the cost of collection from the nonpaying service user.  If the district prevails in a legal proceeding filed under this subsection, the court shall award costs, attorney's fees, and interest to be paid by the nonpaying service user.  A delinquent fee accrues interest at the legal rate beginning on the date the payment becomes due.
