If the person paid the amount of the penalty under Subsection (b)(2) and if that amount is reduced or is not upheld by the court, the court shall order that the department pay the appropriate amount plus accrued interest to the person.  The rate of the interest is the rate charged on loans to depository institutions by the New York Federal Reserve Bank, and the interest shall be paid for the period beginning on the date the penalty was paid and ending on the date the penalty is remitted.
