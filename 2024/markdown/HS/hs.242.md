    SUBCHAPTER A. GENERAL PROVISIONS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 242.001.  SCOPE, PURPOSE, AND IMPLEMENTATION.  (a)  It is the goal of this chapter to ensure that institutions in this state deliver the highest possible quality of care.  This chapter, and the rules and standards adopted under this chapter, establish minimum acceptable levels of care.  A violation of a minimum acceptable level of care established under this chapter or a rule or standard adopted under this chapter is forbidden by law.  Each institution licensed under this chapter shall, at a minimum, provide quality care in accordance with this chapter and the rules and standards.  Components of quality of care addressed by these rules and standards include:
    
    (1)  quality of life;
    
    (2)  access to care;
    
    (3)  continuity of care;
    
    (4)  comprehensiveness of care;
    
    (5)  coordination of services;
    
    (6)  humaneness of treatment;
    
    (7)  conservatism in intervention;
    
    (8)  safety of the environment;
    
    (9)  professionalism of caregivers;  and
    
    (10)  participation in useful studies.
    
    (b)  The rules and standards adopted under this chapter may be more stringent than the standards imposed by federal law for certification for participation in the state Medicaid program.  The rules and standards may not be less stringent than the Medicaid certification standards imposed under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA), Pub.L. No. 100-203.
    
    (c)  The rules and standards adopted under this chapter apply to each licensed institution.  The rules and standards are intended for use in state surveys of the facilities and any investigation and enforcement action and are designed to be useful to consumers and providers in assessing the quality of care provided in an institution.
    
    (d)  The legislature finds that the construction, maintenance, and operation of institutions shall be regulated in a manner that protects the residents of the institutions by:
    
    (1)  providing the highest possible quality of care;
    
    (2)  strictly monitoring all factors relating to the health, safety, welfare, and dignity of each resident;
    
    (3)  imposing prompt and effective remedies for noncompliance with licensing standards;  and
    
    (4)  providing the public with information concerning the operation of institutions in this state.
    
    (e)  It is the legislature's intent that this chapter accomplish the goals listed in Subsection (d).
    
    (f)  This chapter shall be construed broadly to accomplish the purposes set forth in this section.

    Sec. 242.0336.  TEMPORARY CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP LICENSE.  (a)  For purposes of this section, a temporary change of ownership license is a temporary 90-day license issued to an applicant who proposes to become the new operator of an institution existing on the date the application is filed.
    
    (b)  After receiving an application for a temporary change of ownership license, the department shall issue a temporary license to the applicant if, after investigation, the department finds that the applicant and any other person described by Section [242.032](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=242.032)(d) meet:

    (b-1)  Except as provided by Subsection (b-2), the department may not issue a temporary change of ownership license before the 31st day after the date the department has received both:
    
    (1)  the application for the license; and
    
    (2)  notification, in writing, of the intent of the institution's existing license holder to transfer operation of the institution to the applicant beginning on a date specified by the applicant.
    
    (b-2)  Notwithstanding Section [242.0335](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=242.0335), the executive commissioner shall establish criteria under which the department may waive the 30-day requirement or the notification requirement of Subsection (b-1).  The criteria may include the occurrence of forcible entry and detainer, death, or divorce or other events that affect the ownership of the institution by the existing license holder.
    
    (b-3)  After receipt of an application or written notification described by Subsection (b-1), the department may place a hold on payments to the existing license holder in an amount not to exceed the average of the monthly vendor payments paid to the facility, as determined by the department.  The department shall release funds to the previous license holder not later than the 120th day after the date on which the final reporting requirements are met and any resulting informal reviews or formal appeals are resolved.  The department may reduce the amount of funds released to the previous license holder by the amount owed to the department or the commission under the previous license holder's Medicaid contract or license.
    
    (b-4)  The executive commissioner shall adopt rules for the department that define a change of ownership.  In adopting the rules, the executive commissioner shall consider:
    
    (1)  the proportion of ownership interest that is being transferred to another person;
    
    (2)  the addition or removal of a stockholder, partner, owner, or other controlling person;
    
    (3)  the reorganization of the license holder into a different type of business entity; and
    
    (4)  the death or incapacity of a stockholder, partner, or owner.
    
    (b-5)  The executive commissioner may adopt rules for the department that require a license holder to notify the department of any change, including a change that is not a change of ownership, as that term is defined by rules adopted under Subsection (b-4).  Nothing in this section prevents the department from acting under Section [242.061](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=242.061) or any other provision of this chapter.
    
    (c)  The department shall issue or deny a temporary change of ownership license not later than the 31st day after the date of receipt of the completed application.  The effective date of a temporary change of ownership license issued under this section is the date requested in the application unless:
    
    (1)  the department does not receive the application and written notification described by Subsection (b-1) at least 30 days before that date; and
    
    (2)  no waiver under Subsection (b-2) applies.
    
    (c-1)  If the department does not receive the application and written notification required by Subsection (b-1) at least 30 days before the effective date requested in the application and Subsection (b-2) does not apply, the effective date of the temporary change of ownership license is the 31st day after the date the department receives both the application and the notification.
    
    (d)  Except as provided in Subsection (d-1), after the department issues a temporary change of ownership license to the applicant, the department shall conduct an inspection or survey of the nursing facility under Section [242.043](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=242.043) as soon as reasonably possible.  During the period between the issuance of the temporary license and the inspection or survey of the nursing facility or desk review under Subsection (d-1), the department may not place a hold on vendor payments to the temporary license holder.
    
    (d-1)  The executive commissioner shall establish criteria under which the department may substitute a desk review of the facility's compliance with applicable requirements for the on-site inspection or survey under Subsection (d).
    
    (e)  After conducting an inspection or survey under Subsection (d) or a desk review under Subsection (d-1), the department shall issue a license under Section [242.033](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=242.033) to the temporary change of ownership license holder if the nursing facility passes the desk review, inspection, or survey and the applicant meets the requirements of Section [242.033](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=242.033).  If the nursing facility fails to pass the desk review, inspection, or survey or the applicant fails to meet the requirements of Section [242.033](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=242.033), the department may:
    
    (1)  place a hold on vendor payments to the temporary change of ownership license holder; and
    
    (2)  take any other action authorized under this chapter.
    
    (f)  If the applicant meets the requirements of Section [242.033](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=242.033) and the nursing facility passes a desk review, initial inspection, or subsequent inspection before the temporary change of ownership license expires, the license issued under Section [242.033](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=242.033) is considered effective on the date the department determines under Subsection (c) or (c-1).
    
    (g)  A temporary change of ownership license issued under Subsection (b) expires on the 90th day after the effective date established under Subsection (c) or (c-1).
