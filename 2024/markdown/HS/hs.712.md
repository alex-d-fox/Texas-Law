    Sec. 712.00395.  SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATE OF AUTHORITY; FEE.  (a)  A certificate holder may apply to the commissioner for permission to surrender the certificate of authority if the holder:
    
    (1)  is a cemetery that qualified for an exemption under Section [711.021](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=711.021)(g), but voluntarily elected to become a perpetual care cemetery;

    (b)  The application for permission to surrender a certificate of authority must be sworn to and be on a form prescribed by the department.
    
    (c)  The certificate holder shall publish a notice of intention to surrender a certificate of authority to operate a perpetual care cemetery one time in a newspaper of general circulation in each county in which the cemetery is located.  The notice must:
    
    (1)  be in the form and include the information required by the banking commissioner;
    
    (2)  state that:
    
    (A)  the certificate holder is applying to surrender the holder's certificate of authority to operate a perpetual care cemetery;
    
    (B)  a cemetery plot owner or cemetery plot owner's heir may request a hearing to contest the surrender; and
    
    (C)  a request for a hearing must be filed with the department not later than the 14th day after the date the notice is published.
    
    (d)  The certificate holder shall submit, not later than the seventh day after the date the notice is published, a publisher's affidavit evidencing publication of the notice.

    (f)  If a request for a hearing is not timely filed by a plot owner or plot owner's heir, the commissioner may approve or deny the application.
    
    (g)  If an application is denied, and if a hearing is not held before the denial, the applicant may request a hearing to appeal the denial of the application.  The applicant's request for a hearing must be filed with the commissioner not later than the 30th day after the date the notice of denial is mailed.  The hearing is a contested case under Chapter [2001](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code.
    
    (h)  An order approving the surrender of a certificate of authority must impose four conditions that are not subject to objection.

The order approving the surrender must:
    
    (1)  require the perpetual care fund to remain in an irrevocable trust, with the permissible distributions to be used for perpetual care of the cemetery in general and for those plots that were purchased before the certificate was surrendered;
    
    (2)  require that the cemetery remove any signage or other announcement stating that the cemetery is a perpetual care cemetery;
    
    (3)  require each contract and other evidence of ownership entered into after the date of the order to clearly state that the cemetery is not regulated by the Texas Department of Banking and may not use the term "perpetual care cemetery"; and
    
    (4)  state the location of cemetery records and require the cemetery to:
    
    (A)  retain existing records regarding the perpetual care fund for five years after the date of the order; and
    
    (B)  continue to comply with all recordkeeping requirements of Chapter [711](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=711).
    
    (i)  Not later than the 10th day after the date an order approving the surrender of a certificate of authority is signed, the certificate holder shall deliver the original certificate of authority to the commissioner along with a written notice of surrender that includes the location of the certificate holder's records and the name, address, telephone number, and other contact information for an individual who is authorized to provide access to the records.
    
    (j)  The surrender of a certificate of authority does not reduce or eliminate a certificate holder's administrative, civil, or criminal liability arising from any acts or omissions that occur before the surrender of the certificate.

    Sec. 712.021.  ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSES OF FUND.  (a)  Except as provided by Subsection (h), a corporation that operates a perpetual care cemetery in this state shall have a fund established with a trust company or a bank with trust powers that is located in this state.  The trust company or bank may not have more than one director who is also a director of the corporation.
    
    (b)  Except as otherwise provided by this chapter, the principal of the fund may not be reduced voluntarily, and it must remain inviolable.  The trustee shall maintain the principal of the fund separate from all operating funds of the corporation.
    
    (c)  In establishing a fund, the corporation may adopt plans for the general care, maintenance, and embellishment of its perpetual care cemetery.
    
    (d)  The fund and the trustee are governed by the Texas Trust Code (Section [111.001](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=111.001) et seq., Property Code).
    
    (e)  A corporation that establishes a fund may receive and hold for the fund and as a part of the fund or as an incident to the fund any property contributed to the fund.
    
    (f)  The fund and contributions to the fund are for charitable purposes.  The perpetual care financed by the fund is:
    
    (1)  the discharge of a duty due from the corporation to persons interred and to be interred in its perpetual care cemetery;  and
    
    (2)  for the benefit and protection of the public by preserving and keeping the perpetual care cemetery from becoming a place of disorder, reproach, and desolation in the community in which the perpetual care cemetery is located.
    
    (g)  In this subsection, "master trust account" means an account containing the perpetual care trust funds of two or more certificate holders for the purpose of collective investment and administration. The trustors of two or more perpetual care trust funds may establish a master trust account in which deposits required by this chapter are made, provided that separate records of principal and income are maintained for each perpetual care cemetery for the benefit of which the master trust account is established, and further provided that the income attributable to each perpetual care cemetery is used only for the perpetual care of that cemetery.
    
    (h)  A corporation may apply to the commissioner for temporary relief and placement of a perpetual care trust fund in a segregated interest bearing account at a Texas financial institution, as defined by Section [201.101](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=201.101), Finance Code, if the corporation:
    
    (1)  has been operating a perpetual care cemetery in this state for at least two years; and
    
    (2)  has a perpetual care trust fund with a balance of less than $100,000, the income of which is insufficient to pay trustee fees.

    Sec. 712.0352.  MODIFICATION OF DISTRIBUTION METHOD.  (a)  Except as otherwise provided by this subchapter, the trustee of a fund shall use the net income method to determine permissible distributions from the fund to the corporation.
    
    (b)  A corporation on concurrence of the corporation's trustee may modify the terms of the trust instrument governing the fund to require the trustee to use the total return method in determining permissible distributions to the corporation.  To convert a net income fund to a total return fund, at least 60 days before the effective date of the conversion, which must be the first day of the fund's next fiscal year, the corporation shall submit written documentation to the commissioner in support of the conversion that includes:
    
    (1)  a copy of the trust instrument governing the fund and any proposed amendments to the instrument necessary to authorize the conversion;
    
    (2)  the trustee's estimates of the current fair market value and the average fair market value of the fund as of the effective date of the conversion, as determined under Section [712.0353](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=712.0353), and actions by the trustee to finalize the trustee's determination of both current and average fair market value of the fund and to advise the corporation and the commissioner as soon as reasonably possible after the effective date;
    
    (3)  a description of the method the trustee used or will use to determine the fair market value of any unique and hard-to-value asset in the fund, and identification and explanation of any asset the trustee excluded or will exclude from the average fair market value calculation;
    
    (4)  the total return percentage selected by the trustee under Section [712.0354](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=712.0354), and the reasons for the selection;
    
    (5)  a copy of the written investment policy for the fund as modified to support use of the total return method; and
    
    (6)  any additional information required by rules adopted under this chapter.
    
    (c)  A corporation that converts the corporation's fund to a total return fund under this section may elect to reconvert the fund to a net income fund and modify the terms of the trust instrument governing the fund to require the trustee to calculate permissible distributions under the net income method.  To reconvert a total return fund to a net income fund, the corporation must submit written documentation to the commissioner in support of the reconversion before the proposed effective date of the reconversion, that includes:
    
    (1)  a copy of the trust instrument governing the fund and any proposed amendments to the instrument necessary to authorize the reconversion;
    
    (2)  the proposed effective date of the reconversion, provided that the effective date must be the first day of the fund's next fiscal year unless the total distributions received or to be received from the fund in the current fiscal year would not exceed the distributions permissible for a net income fund at the beginning of the current fiscal year; and
    
    (3)  any additional information required by rules adopted under this chapter.
    
    (d)  The trustee of a net income fund or a total return fund shall make distributions to the corporation, annually or in more frequent installments agreed to by the trustee and the corporation, to be used by the corporation in the manner required by Section [712.025](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=712.025).

    Sec. 712.0353.  DETERMINATION OF FAIR MARKET VALUE.  (a)  The trustee of a total return fund, or of a net income fund seeking to convert to a total return fund, shall determine for the corporation, in the trustee's sole discretion and in accordance with this section, the average fair market value of the fund at the beginning of each fiscal year.
    
    (b)  The trustee shall derive the average fair market value of the fund at least annually by averaging the fair market value of fund assets, determined on an asset-by-asset basis, as of the beginning of the current fiscal year and in each of the two previous years, or for the entire term of the trust with less than two previous years, using the valuation date or averages of valuation dates as the trustee considers appropriate.  The trustee shall exclude from the fair market value calculation any asset described in Section [712.030](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=712.030)(b) and any asset for which the trustee is not able to reasonably ascertain a fair market value.  In determining the average fair market value, the trustee shall adjust the fair market value for each year used in the calculation as follows:
    
    (1)  for assets added to the fund during the years used to determine the average, the trustee shall add the amount of each addition to all years in which the addition is not included; and
    
    (2)  for assets withdrawn from the fund during the years used to determine the average, other than in satisfaction of permissible distributions, the trustee shall subtract the amount of each withdrawal from all years in which the withdrawal is not included.
    
    (c)  Before the 31st day after the beginning of each fiscal year, the trustee of a total return fund shall send written notice to the commissioner and to the corporation of the trustee's determination of the current fair market value of the fund as of the beginning of the current fiscal year and the average fair market value of the fund for determining permissible distributions for the fiscal year, with identification and explanation of any asset excluded from the determination.  If the trustee alters the methodology of determining fair market value in a manner that changes the fair market value of the fund during a fiscal year, the trustee shall send written notice to the commissioner and to the corporation of the revised current and average fair market value of the fund and the reason for the revision before the first distribution is made based on the revised average fair market value.
    
    (d)  This section does not alter or otherwise affect a fiduciary duty under other law to evaluate and monitor the fair market value of assets held in trust.

(a)  Consistent with the prudent investor rule, the trustee in the exercise of the trustee's sole discretion shall select the total return percentage to be used in determining permissible distributions from a total return trust at least annually, in an amount that represents a reasonable current return from the fund in light of the investment policy currently applicable to the fund, provided that the total return percentage does not exceed five percent.
    
    (b)  Before the 31st day after the beginning of each fiscal year, the trustee of a total return fund shall send written notice to the commissioner and to the corporation of the trustee's determination of the total return percentage to be applied in the fiscal year.  If the trustee alters the total return percentage during a fiscal year, the trustee shall send written notice to the commissioner and to the corporation of the revised total return percentage and the reason for the revision before the first distribution is made based on the new total return percentage.

    Sec. 712.0355.  REGULATORY LIMITS ON DISTRIBUTIONS.  (a)  After notice and an opportunity for hearing, the commissioner by order may convert a total return fund to a net income fund, limit or prohibit distributions from the fund, or both, if:
    
    (1)  the current fair market value of the fund at the beginning of a fiscal year is less than the original principal of the fund, consisting of the sum of all required deposits into the fund under this chapter, including deposits required by Sections [712.004](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=712.004) and [712.028](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=712.028);
    
    (2)  the average fair market value of the fund declines by 10 percent or more over a two-year period; or
    
    (3)  the trustee or other fiduciary of the fund responsible for investment policy has demonstrated a lack of sufficient knowledge and expertise or has failed to ensure that an investment policy is in place to support the use of the total return method of calculating distributions in a manner consistent with achieving the purposes of the fund as provided by Section [712.021](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=712.021)(f).
    
    (b)  The commissioner may decline to impose corrective measures under Subsection (a) if the commissioner finds that:
    
    (1)  the cause of the adverse trend in the fair market value of the fund is due to one or more unusual or temporary factors not within the control of the corporation or trustee of the corporation's fund and could not have been reasonably anticipated;
    
    (2)  the current, written investment policy of the fund, in light of anticipated distributions from the fund, is reasonably designed to protect the fund from further declines in fair market value; and
    
    (3)  the exception appears to be both necessary and appropriate for the continued protection and perpetual existence of the fund.

    (1)  demand deposits, savings accounts, certificates of deposit, or other accounts in financial institutions if the amounts deposited in those accounts are fully covered by federal deposit insurance or otherwise fully secured by a separate fund of securities in the manner provided by Section [184.301](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=184.301), Finance Code;

With the department's prior approval, the corporation may withdraw money from earnings on a preconstruction trust to pay any tax incurred because of the existence of the preconstruction trust.
