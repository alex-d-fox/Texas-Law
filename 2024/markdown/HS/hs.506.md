    Sec. 506.002.  FINDINGS;  PURPOSE.  (a)  The legislature finds that:
    
    (1)  the health and safety of persons living in this state may be improved by providing access to information regarding hazardous chemicals to which those persons may be exposed during emergency situations or as a result of proximity to the manufacture or use of those chemicals;  and
    
    (2)  many facility operators in this state have established suitable information programs for their communities and that access to the information is required of most facility operators under the federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act (EPCRA).
    
    (b)  It is the intent and purpose of this chapter to ensure that accessibility to information regarding hazardous chemicals is provided to:
    
    (1)  fire departments responsible for dealing with chemical hazards during an emergency;
    
    (2)  local emergency planning committees and other emergency planning organizations; and
    
    (3)  the commission to make the information available to the public through specific procedures.
