If of vertical and horizontal slat or grill construction, a space between slats or within the grill may not have a horizontal width of more than eight inches.  If of truss construction, the span of a panel may not exceed three feet.  An opening in the railing enclosures on any type of construction may not exceed two square feet.  A railing enclosure must be free throughout its length from obstructions that tend to break handholds, and the passage space must be smooth and free from obstructions or projections.  A railing enclosure must be designed to withstand a horizontal pressure of 200 pounds per running foot of railing without serious deflection.
    
    (h)  A balcony must be anchored to the building with bolts at least one inch in diameter, extending through the wall of the building and provided with a wall bearing plate on the interior that is at least five inches square and three-eighths inch thick, or must be anchored by such bolts set in concrete or masonry or made integral in new buildings.

    (o)  If a fire escape terminates over a street, alley, private driveway, or other similar situation and terminates in a hinged and counterbalanced section of stairway, the construction of that section of stairs must conform to the stationary parts of the stairway and must be balanced so that the weight of one person on the third or fourth tread will lower the stairway to the landing.  Bearings for counterbalanced stairs must be either bronze bushings or have sufficient clearance to prevent sticking caused by corrosion.  A latch or lock may not be attached to the counterbalanced stairs in the up position, but a latch must be provided to hold the stairs in the down position when they have been swung to the ground.  The connection between stair railings on the stationary part of the stairway and the counterbalanced part of the stairway must be designed to prevent the probability of injury to persons who use the fire escape.  If necessary, a suitable opening must be provided in any awning, roof, or other intervening obstruction to admit the counterbalanced stairs and permit the passage of persons on the stairs.
    
    (p)  The fire escape must be connected to the roof of the building to which it is attached.  If the roof of the building is designed in such a way that escape by way of the roof may be necessary, the fire escape must extend to the roof.  If the connection is only for use by the fire department, it must be made with a gooseneck-type ladder with stringers made of material at least three-eighths inch thick, and rungs at least three-quarters inch in diameter, 16 inches long, and not more than 14 inches apart.  The ladder must be anchored to the wall.

    (j)  A landing composed of the same material as the chute must be provided at the lower end of a straight chute and must be of sufficient length in proportion to the length of the chute and the concavity of its surface to check the momentum attained through gravity and to provide a safe stop.  The landing must be six inches wider than the chute on each side if wall construction does not interfere and must be without sharp edges or ragged projections.  The landing must rest on and be anchored to a concrete base at least six inches thick.
