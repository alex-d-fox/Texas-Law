    Sec. 507.002.  FINDINGS;  PURPOSE.  (a)  The legislature finds that:
    
    (1)  the health and safety of persons living in this state may be improved by providing access to information regarding hazardous chemicals to which those persons may be exposed during emergency situations or as a result of proximity to the use of those chemicals;  and
