    (e)  The court shall deliver to the parties all discoverable information obtained through the exercise of powers provided by this section, including testimony, documents, or things.  The court shall first delete from that information the name of any donor or any other information that could result in the disclosure of a donor's identity, including information described by Subsection (a)(2).
