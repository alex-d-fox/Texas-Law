    SUBCHAPTER D.  MANDATORY PAYMENTS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 295A.151.  MANDATORY PAYMENTS.  (a)  Except as provided by Subsection (e), if the board authorizes a health care provider participation program under this chapter, the board shall require an annual mandatory payment to be assessed on the net patient revenue of each institutional health care provider located in the district.  The board shall provide that the mandatory payment is to be collected at least annually, but not more often than quarterly.  In the first year in which the mandatory payment is required, the mandatory payment is assessed on the net patient revenue of an institutional health care provider as determined by the data reported to the Department of State Health Services under Sections [311.032](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=311.032) and [311.033](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=311.033) in the most recent fiscal year for which that data was reported.  If the institutional health care provider did not report any data under those sections, the provider's net patient revenue is the amount of that revenue as contained in the provider's Medicare cost report submitted for the previous fiscal year or for the closest subsequent fiscal year for which the provider submitted the Medicare cost report.  The district shall update the amount of the mandatory payment on an annual basis.
    
    (b)  The amount of a mandatory payment authorized under this chapter must be a uniform percentage of the amount of net patient revenue generated by each paying hospital in the district.  A mandatory payment authorized under this chapter may not hold harmless any institutional health care provider, as required under 42 U.S.C. Section 1396b(w).
    
    (c)  The aggregate amount of the mandatory payments required of all paying hospitals in the district may not exceed six percent of the aggregate net patient revenue of all paying hospitals in the district.
    
    (d)  Subject to the maximum amount prescribed by Subsection (c), the board shall set the mandatory payments in amounts that in the aggregate will generate sufficient revenue to cover the administrative expenses of the district for activities under this chapter, fund an intergovernmental transfer described by Section [295A.103](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=295A.103)(b)(1), or make other payments authorized under this chapter.  The amount of revenue from mandatory payments that may be used for administrative expenses by the district in a year may not exceed $25,000, plus the cost of collateralization of deposits.  If the board demonstrates to the paying hospitals that the costs of administering the health care provider participation program under this chapter, excluding those costs associated with the collateralization of deposits, exceed $25,000 in any year, on consent of all of the paying hospitals, the district may use additional revenue from mandatory payments received under this chapter to compensate the district for its administrative expenses.  A paying hospital may not unreasonably withhold consent to compensate the district for administrative expenses.
    
    (e)  A paying hospital may not add a mandatory payment required under this section as a surcharge to a patient or insurer.
    
    (f)  A mandatory payment under this chapter is not a tax for purposes of Section [5](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=9.5)(a), Article IX, Texas Constitution, or Chapter [1001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=SD&Value=1001), Special District Local Laws Code.

    Sec. 295A.153.  CORRECTION OF INVALID PROVISION OR PROCEDURE.  To the extent any provision or procedure under this chapter causes a mandatory payment authorized under this chapter to be ineligible for federal matching funds, the board may provide by rule for an alternative provision or procedure that conforms to the requirements of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.  A rule adopted under this section may not create, impose, or materially expand the legal or financial liability or responsibility of the district or an institutional health care provider in the district beyond the provisions of this chapter.  This section does not require the board to adopt a rule.
