    Sec. 257.002.  LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.  (a)  The legislature finds that:
    
    (1)  research supports a conclusion that adequate nurse staffing is directly related to positive patient outcomes and nurse satisfaction with the practice environment;
    
    (2)  nurse satisfaction with the practice environment is in large measure determined by providing an adequate level of nurse staffing based on research findings and patient intensity;
    
    (3)  nurse satisfaction and patient safety can be adversely affected when nurses work excessive hours; and
    
    (4)  hospitals and nurses share a mutual interest in patient safety initiatives that create a healthy environment for nurses and appropriate care for patients.
    
    (b)  In order to protect patients, support greater retention of registered nurses, and promote adequate nurse staffing, the legislature intends to establish a mechanism whereby nurses and hospital management shall participate in a joint process regarding decisions about nurse staffing.
