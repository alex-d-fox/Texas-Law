    (1)  "Commission" means the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

    (4)  "Qualifying fuel" includes any liquid or gaseous fuel or additive registered or verified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, other than standard gasoline or diesel, that is ultimately dispensed into a school bus that provides reductions of emissions of particulate matter.

    Sec. 390.002.  PROGRAM.  (a)  The commission shall establish and administer a clean school bus program designed to reduce the exposure of school children to diesel exhaust in and around diesel-fueled school buses.  Under the program, the commission shall provide grants for eligible projects to offset the incremental cost of projects that reduce emissions of diesel exhaust.
    
    (b)  Projects that may be considered for a grant under the program include:
    
    (1)  diesel oxidation catalysts for school buses built before 1994;
    
    (2)  diesel particulate filters for school buses built from 1994 to 1998;
    
    (3)  the purchase and use of emission-reducing add-on equipment for school buses, including devices that reduce crankcase emissions;
    
    (4)  the use of qualifying fuel;
    
    (5)  other technologies that the commission finds will bring about significant emissions reductions; and
    
    (6)  replacement of a pre-2007 model year school bus.
