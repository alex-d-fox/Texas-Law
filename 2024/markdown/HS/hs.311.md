    (2)  For purposes of satisfying Subdivision (1)(C), a hospital or hospital system may not change its existing fiscal year unless the hospital or hospital system changes its ownership or corporate structure as a result of a sale or merger.
    
    (3)  A nonprofit hospital that has been designated as a disproportionate share hospital under the state Medicaid program in the current fiscal year or in either of the previous two fiscal years shall be considered to have provided a reasonable amount of charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care and shall be deemed in compliance with the standards in this subsection.
    
    (c)  The providing of charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care in accordance with Subsection (b)(1)(A) shall be guided by the prudent business judgment of the hospital which will ultimately determine the appropriate level of charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care based on the community needs, the available resources of the hospital, the tax-exempt benefits received by the hospital, and other factors that may be unique to the hospital, such as the hospital's volume of Medicare and Medicaid patients.  These criteria shall not be determinative factors, but shall be guidelines contributing to the hospital's decision, along with other factors which may be unique to the hospital.  The standards set forth in Subsections (b)(1)(B) and (b)(1)(C) shall also not be considered determinative of the amount of charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care that will be considered reasonable under Subsection (b)(1)(A).
    
    (d)  For purposes of this section, a hospital that satisfies Subsection (b)(1)(A) or (b)(3) shall be excluded in determining a hospital system's compliance with the standards provided by Subsection (b)(1)(B) or (b)(1)(C).
    
    (e)  In any fiscal year that a hospital or hospital system, through unintended miscalculation, fails to meet any of the standards in Subsection (b), the hospital or hospital system shall not lose its tax-exempt status without the opportunity to cure the miscalculation in the fiscal year following the fiscal year the failure is discovered by both meeting one of the standards and providing an additional amount of charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care that is equal to the shortfall from the previous fiscal year.  A hospital or hospital system may apply this provision only once every five years.
    
    (f)  A nonprofit hospital or hospital system under contract with a local county to provide indigent health care services under Chapter [61](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=61) may credit unreimbursed costs from direct care provided to an eligible county resident toward meeting the nonprofit hospital's or system's charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care requirement.
