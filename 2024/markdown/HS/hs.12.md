    (e)  One of the primary goals of the department in integrating the administration of contracts entered into by the executive commissioner or the executive commissioner's designee on behalf of the department with providers of health care services shall be designing an integrated contract administration system that reduces the administrative and paperwork burden on providers while still providing the department with the information it needs to effectively administer the contracts.

    (C)  contract terms regarding incentives for contractors to meet or exceed contract requirements;
    
    (3)  the integration of contract monitoring, particularly with regard to monitoring providers that deliver health services for the department under more than one contract or under more than one department program; and
    
    (4)  the integration of reimbursement methods:

    (B)  including the application across programs of the most effective and efficient reimbursement technologies or methods that are available to the department under any of its programs.
    
    (f)  The department shall examine the extent to which the department could integrate all or part of its health care delivery programs into a single delivery system.
    
    (g)  If a federal requirement that the federal government may waive restricts the department's integration efforts under this section, the department may seek a waiver of the requirement from the federal government.  If the waiver affects a program for which another state agency is designated the single state agency for federal purposes, the department shall request the single state agency to seek the waiver.
    
    (h)  The department may not integrate health care delivery programs under this section in a way that affects the single state agency status of another state agency for federal purposes without obtaining the approval of the commission and any necessary federal approval.
