(a)  A person 16 years of age or older may request admission to an inpatient mental health facility or for outpatient mental health services by filing a request with the administrator of the facility where admission or outpatient treatment is requested.  Subject to Subsection (c-1), the parent, managing conservator, or guardian of a person younger than 18 years of age may request the admission of the person to an inpatient mental health facility or for outpatient mental health services by filing a request with the administrator of the facility where admission or outpatient treatment is requested.
    
    (a-1)  A person eligible to consent to treatment for the person under Section [32.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=32.001)(a)(1), (2), or (3), Family Code, may request temporary authorization for the admission of the person to an inpatient mental health facility by petitioning under Chapter [35A](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=35A), Family Code, in the district court in the county in which the person resides for an order for temporary authorization to consent to voluntary mental health services under this section.

    (a-2)  Except as provided by Subsection (c-1), an inpatient mental health facility may admit or provide services to a person 16 years of age or older and younger than 18 years of age if the person's parent, managing conservator, or guardian consents to the admission or services, even if the person does not consent to the admission or services.
    
    (b)  An admission request must be in writing and signed by the person requesting the admission.
    
    (c)  A person or agency appointed as the guardian or a managing conservator of a person younger than 18 years of age and acting as an employee or agent of the state or a political subdivision of the state may request admission of the person younger than 18 years of age to an inpatient mental health facility only as provided by Subsection (c-2) or pursuant to an application for court-ordered mental health services or emergency detention or an order for protective custody.
    
    (c-1)  A person younger than 18 years of age may not be involuntarily committed unless provided by this chapter, Chapter [55](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=55), Family Code, or department rule.
    
    (c-2)  The Department of Family and Protective Services may request the admission to an inpatient mental health facility of a minor in the managing conservatorship of that department only if a physician states the physician's opinion, and the detailed reasons for that opinion, that the minor is a person:
    
    (1)  with mental illness or who demonstrates symptoms of a serious emotional disorder; and
    
    (2)  who presents a risk of serious harm to self or others if not immediately restrained or hospitalized.
    
    (c-3)  The admission to an inpatient mental health facility under Subsection (c-2) of a minor in the managing conservatorship of the Department of Family and Protective Services is a significant event for purposes of Section [264.018](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=264.018), Family Code, and the Department of Family and Protective Services shall provide notice of the significant event:

    (2)  to the court with continuing jurisdiction before the expiration of three business days after the minor's admission.
    
    (c-4)  The Department of Family and Protective Services periodically shall review the need for continued inpatient treatment of a minor admitted to an inpatient mental health facility under Subsection (c-2).  If following the review that department determines there is no longer a need for continued inpatient treatment, that department shall notify the facility administrator designated to detain the minor that the minor may no longer be detained unless an application for court-ordered mental health services is filed.
    
    (d)  The administrator of an inpatient or outpatient mental health facility may admit a minor who is 16 years of age or older to an inpatient or outpatient mental health facility as a voluntary patient without the consent of the parent, managing conservator, or guardian.
    
    (e)  A request for admission as a voluntary patient must state that the person for whom admission is requested agrees to voluntarily remain in the facility until the person's discharge and that the person consents to the diagnosis, observation, care, and treatment provided until the earlier of:
