The estimate must be provided not later than the 10th business day after the date on which the estimate is requested.  The facility must advise the consumer that:

    (e)  A facility shall provide to the consumer at the consumer's request an itemized statement of the billed services if the consumer requests the statement not later than the first anniversary of the date the person is discharged from the facility.  The facility shall provide the statement to the consumer not later than the 10th business day after the date on which the statement is requested.
    
    (f)  A facility shall provide an itemized statement of billed services to a third-party payor who is actually or potentially responsible for paying all or part of the billed services provided to a patient and who has received a claim for payment of those services.

The request must be made not later than one year after the date on which the payor received the claim for payment.  The facility shall provide the statement to the payor not later than the 30th day after the date on which the payor requests the statement.  If a third-party payor receives a claim for payment of part but not all of the billed services, the third-party payor may request an itemized statement of only the billed services for which payment is claimed or to which any deduction or copayment applies.
    
    (g)  A facility in violation of this section is subject to enforcement action by the appropriate licensing agency.
    
    (h)  If a consumer or a third-party payor requests more than two copies of the statement, the facility may charge a reasonable fee for the third and subsequent copies provided.  The fee may not exceed the sum of:
