The interest accrues at the rate charged on loans to depository institutions by the New York Federal Reserve Bank.  The interest shall be paid for the period beginning on the date the penalty is paid and ending on the date the penalty is remitted.
    
    (h)  If the person gave a supersedeas bond and the penalty is not upheld by the court, the court shall order, when the court's judgment becomes final, the release of the bond.
