(a)  The executive commissioner by rule shall prescribe the criteria that constitute exposure to reportable diseases.  The criteria must be based on activities that the United States Public Health Service determines pose a risk of infection.
    
    (b)  A person whose occupation or whose volunteer service is included in one or more of the following categories may request the department or a health authority to order testing of another person who may have exposed the person to a reportable disease:
    
    (1)  a law enforcement officer;

    (3)  an emergency medical service employee or paramedic;

    (6)  an employee of a juvenile probation department; or
    
    (7)  any other emergency response employee or volunteer.
    
    (c)  A request under this section may be made only if the person:
    
    (1)  has experienced the exposure in the course of the person's employment or volunteer service;
    
    (2)  believes that the exposure places the person at risk of a reportable disease; and

    (d)  The department or the department's designee who meets the minimum training requirements prescribed by department rule shall review the person's request and inform the person whether the request meets the criteria establishing risk of infection with a reportable disease.
    
    (e)  The department or the department's designee shall give the person who is subject to the order prompt and confidential written notice of the order.  The order must:
    
    (1)  state the grounds and provisions of the order, including the factual basis for its issuance;
    
    (2)  refer the person to appropriate health care facilities where the person can be tested for reportable diseases; and

    (f)  If the person who is subject to the order refuses to comply, the prosecuting attorney who represents the state in district court, on request of the department or the department's designee, shall petition the district court for a hearing on the order.  The person who is subject to the order has the right to an attorney at the hearing, and the court shall appoint an attorney for a person who cannot afford legal representation.  The person may not waive the right to an attorney unless the person has consulted with an attorney.
    
    (g)  In reviewing the order, the court shall determine whether exposure occurred and whether that exposure presents a possible risk of infection as defined by department rule.  The attorney for the state and the attorney for the person subject to the order may introduce evidence at the hearing in support of or opposition to the testing of the person.  On conclusion of the hearing, the court shall either issue an appropriate order requiring counseling and testing of the person for reportable diseases or refuse to issue the order if the court has determined that the counseling and testing of the person is unnecessary.  The court may assess court costs against the person who requested the test if the court finds that there was not reasonable cause for the request.
    
    (h)  The department or the department's designee shall inform the person who requested the order and the designated infection control officer of the person who requested the order, if that person is an emergency response employee or volunteer, of the results of the test.  If the person subject to the order is found to have a reportable disease, the department or the department's designee shall inform that person and the person who requested the order of the need for medical follow-up and counseling services.  The department or the department's designee shall develop protocols for coding test specimens to ensure that any identifying information concerning the person tested will be destroyed as soon as the testing is complete.

If the property is land or a structure or an animal or other property on the land, the department or health authority shall also post the notice on the land and at a place convenient to the public in the county courthouse.  If the property is infected or contaminated as a result of a public health disaster, the department or health authority is not required to provide notice under this subsection.
    
    (c)  The department or health authority shall remove the quarantine and return control of the property to the person who owns or controls it if the property is found not to be infected or contaminated.  The department or health authority by written order may require the person who owns or controls the property to impose control measures that are technically feasible to disinfect or decontaminate the property if the property is found to be infected or contaminated.
    
    (d)  The department or health authority shall remove the quarantine and return control of the property to the person who owns or controls it if the control measures are effective.  If the control measures are ineffective or if there is not a technically feasible control measure available for use, the department or health authority may continue the quarantine and order the person who owns or controls the property:
    
    (1)  to destroy the property, other than land, in a manner that disinfects or decontaminates the property to prevent the spread of infection or contamination;
    
    (2)  if the property is land, to securely fence the perimeter of the land or any part of the land that is infected or contaminated; or
    
    (3)  to securely seal off an infected or contaminated structure or other property on land to prevent entry into the infected or contaminated area until the quarantine is removed by the department or health authority.
    
    (d-1)  In a public health disaster, the department or health authority by written order may require a person who owns or controls property to impose control measures that are technically feasible to disinfect or decontaminate the property or, if technically feasible control measures are not available, may order the person who owns or controls the property:
    
    (1)  to destroy the property, other than land, in a manner that disinfects or decontaminates the property to prevent the spread of infection or contamination;
    
    (2)  if the property is land, to securely fence the perimeter of the land or any part of the land that is infected or contaminated;  or
    
    (3)  to securely seal off an infected or contaminated structure or other property on land to prevent entry into the infected or contaminated area until the department or health authority authorizes entry into the structure or property.
    
    (e)  The department or health authority may petition the county or district court of the county in which the property is located for orders necessary for public health if:
    
    (1)  a person fails or refuses to comply with the orders of the department or health authority as required by this section;  and
    
    (2)  the department or health authority has reason to believe that the property is or may be infected or contaminated with a communicable disease that presents an immediate threat to the public health.
    
    (f)  After the filing of a petition, the court may grant injunctive relief for the health and safety of the public.
    
    (g)  The person who owns or controls the property shall pay all expenses of implementing control measures, court costs, storage, and other justifiable expenses.  The court may require the person who owns or controls the property to execute a bond in an amount set by the court to ensure the performance of any control measures, restoration, or destruction ordered by the court.  If the property is an object, the bond may not exceed the value of the object in a noninfected or noncontaminated state.  The bond shall be returned to the person when the department or health authority informs the court that the property is no longer infected or contaminated or that the property has been destroyed.
    
    (h)  If the court finds that the property is not infected or contaminated, it shall order the department or health authority to:
    
    (1)  remove the quarantine; 
    
    (2)  if the property is an object, remove the quarantine tags;  and
    
    (3)  release the property to the person who owns or controls it.
    
    (i)  The department or health authority, as appropriate, shall charge the person who owns or controls the property for the cost of any control measures performed by the department's or health authority's employees.  The department shall deposit the payments received to the credit of the general revenue fund to be used for the administration of this chapter.  A health authority shall distribute payments received to each county, municipality, or other jurisdiction in an amount proportional to the jurisdiction's contribution to the quarantine and control expense.
    
    (j)  In this section, "property" means:
    
    (1)  an object; 
    
    (2)  a parcel of land;  or
    
    (3)  a structure, animal, or other property on a parcel of land.
    
    (k)  In a public health disaster, the department or a health authority may impose additional control measures the department or health authority considers necessary and most appropriate to arrest, control, and eradicate the threat to the public health.
    
    (l)  A peace officer, including a sheriff or constable, may use reasonable force to:
    
    (1)  secure a property subject to a court order issued under this section; and

    Sec. 81.085.  AREA QUARANTINE;  CRIMINAL PENALTY.  (a)  If an outbreak of communicable disease occurs in this state, the commissioner or one or more health authorities may impose an area quarantine coextensive with the area affected.  The commissioner may impose an area quarantine, if the commissioner has reasonable cause to believe that individuals or property in the area may be infected or contaminated with a communicable disease, for the period necessary to determine whether an outbreak of communicable disease has occurred.  A health authority may impose the quarantine only within the boundaries of the health authority's jurisdiction.
    
    (b)  A health authority may not impose an area quarantine until the authority consults with the department.  A health authority that imposes an area quarantine shall give written notice to and shall consult with the governing body of each county and municipality in the health authority's jurisdiction that has territory in the affected area as soon as practicable.
    
    (c)  The department may impose additional disease control measures in a quarantine area that the department considers necessary and most appropriate to arrest, control, and eradicate the threat to the public health.  Absent preemptive action by the department under this chapter or by the governor under Chapter [418](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=418), Government Code (Texas Disaster Act of 1975), a health authority may impose in a quarantine area under the authority's jurisdiction additional disease control measures that the health authority considers necessary and most appropriate to arrest, control, and eradicate the threat to the public health.
    
    (d)  If an affected area includes territory in an adjacent state, the department may enter into cooperative agreements with the appropriate officials or agencies of that state to:
    
    (1)  exchange morbidity, mortality, and other technical information; 
    
    (2)  receive extrajurisdictional inspection reports; 
    
    (3)  coordinate disease control measures; 
    
    (4)  disseminate instructions to the population of the area, operators of interstate private or common carriers, and private vehicles in transit across state borders;  and
    
    (5)  participate in other public health activities appropriate to arrest, control, and eradicate the threat to the public health.
    
    (e)  The department or health authority may use all reasonable means of communication to inform persons in the quarantine area of the department's or health authority's orders and instructions during the period of area quarantine.  The department or health authority shall publish at least once each week during the area quarantine period, in a newspaper of general circulation in the area, a notice of the orders or instructions in force with a brief explanation of their meaning and effect.  Notice by publication is sufficient to inform persons in the area of their rights, duties, and obligations under the orders or instructions.
    
    (f)  The department or, with the department's consent, a health authority may terminate an area quarantine.
    
    (g)  To provide isolation and quarantine facilities during an area quarantine, the commissioner's court of a county, the governing body of a municipality, or the governing body of a hospital district may suspend the admission of patients desiring admission for elective care and treatment, except for needy or indigent residents for whom the county, municipality, or district is constitutionally or statutorily required to care.
    
    (h)  A person commits an offense if the person knowingly fails or refuses to obey a rule, order, or instruction of the department or an order or instruction of a health authority issued under a department rule and published during an area quarantine under this section.  An offense under this subsection is a felony of the third degree.
    
    (i)  On request of the department during a public health disaster, an individual shall disclose the individual's immunization information.  If the individual does not have updated or appropriate immunizations, the department may take appropriate action during a quarantine to protect that individual and the public from the communicable disease.
    
    (j)  A peace officer, including a sheriff or constable, may use reasonable force to:
    
    (1)  secure a quarantine area; and
    
    (2)  except as directed by the department or health authority, prevent an individual from entering or leaving the quarantine area.

The department or health authority, as appropriate, shall charge and be reimbursed for the cost of control measures performed by the department's or health authority's employees.  The department shall deposit the reimbursements to the credit of the general revenue fund to be used to administer this chapter.  A health authority shall distribute the reimbursements to each county, municipality, or other governmental entity in an amount proportional to that entity's contribution to the quarantine and control expense.
    
    (e)  The owner or claimant of cargo or an object on board the carrier or conveyance shall pay the expense of the control measures employed in the manner provided by Section [81.084](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=81.084).  The cost of services rendered or provided by the department or health authority is subject to reimbursement as provided by Subsection (d).
    
    (f)  A crew member, passenger, or individual on board the carrier or conveyance shall pay the expense of control measures employed under Section [81.083](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=81.083).  The state may pay the expenses of an individual who is:
    
    (1)  without the financial means to pay for part or all of the required medical care or treatment;  and
    
    (2)  not eligible for benefits under an insurance contract, group policy, or prepaid health plan, or benefits provided by a federal, state, or local medical assistance program, as provided by Section [81.083](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=81.083).

    (1)  require that the cargo or object be transported in secure confinement or sealed in a car, trailer, hold, or compartment, as appropriate, that is secured on the order and instruction of the department or health authority, if the cargo or object is being transported through this state;
    
    (2)  require that the cargo or object be unloaded at an alternate location equipped with adequate investigative and disease control facilities if the cargo or object is being transported to an intermediate or ultimate destination in this state that cannot provide the necessary facilities; and
    
    (3)  investigate and, if necessary, quarantine the cargo or object and impose any required control measure as authorized by Section [81.084](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=81.084).
