    (g)  if it is a banned device;
    
    (h)  if it is a device and the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for its manufacture, packing, storage, or installations are not in conformity with applicable requirements under Section 520(f)(1) of the federal Act or an applicable condition as prescribed by an order under Section 520(f)(2) of the federal Act; or

    Sec. 431.161.  POISONOUS OR DELETERIOUS SUBSTANCES.  (a)  Any poisonous or deleterious substance, food additive, pesticide chemical in or on a raw agricultural commodity, or color additive shall, with respect to any particular use or intended use, be deemed unsafe for the purpose of Section [431.081](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=431.081)(a)(2) with respect to any food, Section [431.111](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=431.111)(a) with respect to any drug or device, or Section [431.141](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=431.141) with respect to any cosmetic.  However, if a rule adopted under Section [431.181](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=431.181) or Subsection (b) is in effect that limits the quantity of that substance, and if the use or intended use of that substance conforms to the terms prescribed by the rule, a food, drug, or cosmetic shall not, by reason of bearing or containing that substance in accordance with the rules, be considered adulterated within the meaning of Section [431.081](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=431.081)(a)(1), [431.111](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=431.111), or [431.141](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=431.141).
    
    (b)  The executive commissioner, whenever public health or other considerations in the state so require or on the petition of an interested party, may adopt rules prescribing tolerances for any added, poisonous, or deleterious substances, food additives, pesticide chemicals in or on raw agricultural commodities, or color additives, including zero tolerances and exemptions from tolerances in the case of pesticide chemicals in or on raw agricultural commodities.  The rules may prescribe the conditions under which a food additive or a color additive may be safely used and may prescribe exemptions if the food additive or color additive is to be used solely for investigational or experimental purposes.  Rules adopted under this section limiting the quantity of poisonous or deleterious substances in food must provide equal or stricter standards than those adopted by the federal Food and Drug Administration or its successor.  A person petitioning for the adoption of a rule shall establish by data submitted to the executive commissioner that a necessity exists for the rule and that its effect will not be detrimental to the public health.  If the data furnished by the petitioner are not sufficient to allow the executive commissioner to determine whether the rules should be adopted, the executive commissioner may require additional data to be submitted.  The petitioner's failure to comply with the request is sufficient grounds to deny the request. In adopting rules relating to those substances, the executive commissioner shall consider, among other relevant factors, the following information furnished by the petitioner, if any:
    
    (1)  the name and all pertinent information concerning the substance, including, if available, its chemical identity and composition, a statement of the conditions of the proposed use, directions, recommendations, and suggestions, specimens of proposed labeling, all relevant data bearing on the physical or other technical effect, and the quantity required to produce that effect;
    
    (2)  the probable composition of any substance formed in or on a food, drug, or cosmetic resulting from the use of that substance;
    
    (3)  the probable consumption of that substance in the diet of man and animals, taking into account any chemically or pharmacologically related substance in the diet;
    
    (4)  safety factors that, in the opinion of experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety of those substances for the use or uses for which they are proposed to be used, are generally recognized as appropriate for the use of animal experimentation data;
    
    (5)  the availability of any needed practicable methods of analysis for determining the identity and quantity of:
    
    (A)  that substance in or on an article;
    
    (B)  any substance formed in or on an article because of the use of that substance; and
    
    (C)  the pure substance and all intermediates and impurities; and
    
    (6)  facts supporting a contention that the proposed use of that substance will serve a useful purpose.
    
    (c)  The executive commissioner may adopt emergency rules under Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code, to establish tolerance levels of poisonous or deleterious substances in food.

    (3)  any evidence suggesting the product is intended for human consumption, regardless of any consumption prohibitions or warnings on the packaging of the commodity; or
    
    (4)  whether any of the following factors suggest the commodity is an abusable synthetic substance intended for illicit drug use:
    
    (A)  the appearance of the packaging of the commodity;
    
    (B)  oral or written statements or representations of a person who sells, manufactures, distributes, or imports the commodity;

    SUBCHAPTER H. FAIR PACKAGING AND LABELING;  FALSE ADVERTISING
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 431.181.  FAIR PACKAGING AND LABELING.  (a)  All labels of consumer commodities, as defined by this chapter, shall conform with the requirements for the declaration of net quantity of contents of Section 4 of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (15 U.S.C. 1451 et seq.) and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto;  provided, that consumer commodities exempted from the requirements of Section 4 of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act shall also be exempt from this subsection.
    
    (b)  The label of any package of a consumer commodity that bears a representation as to the number of servings of the commodity contained in the package shall bear a statement of the net quantity (in terms of weight, measure, or numerical count) of each serving.
    
    (c)  No person shall distribute or cause to be distributed in commerce any packaged consumer commodity if any qualifying words or phrases appear in conjunction with the separate statement of the net quantity of contents required by Subsection (a), but nothing in this subsection shall prohibit supplemental statements at other places on the package describing in nondeceptive terms the net quantity of contents;  provided, that the supplemental statements of net quantity of contents shall not include any term qualifying a unit of weight, measure, or count that tends to exaggerate the amount of the commodity contained in the package.
    
    (d)  Whenever the executive commissioner determines that rules containing prohibitions or requirements other than those prescribed by Subsection (a) are necessary to prevent the deception of consumers or to facilitate value comparisons as to any consumer commodity, the executive commissioner shall adopt with respect to that commodity rules effective to:
    
    (1)  establish and define standards for the characterization of the size of a package enclosing any consumer commodity, which may be used to supplement the label statement of net quantity of contents of packages containing such commodity, but this subdivision shall not be construed as authorizing any limitation on the size, shape, weight, dimensions, or number of packages that may be used to enclose any commodity;
    
    (2)  regulate the placement on any package containing any commodity, or on any label affixed to the commodity, of any printed matter stating or representing by implication that such commodity is offered for retail sale at a price lower than the ordinary and customary retail sale price or that a retail sale price advantage is accorded to purchasers thereof by reason of the size of that package or the quantity of its contents;
    
    (3)  require that the label on each package of a consumer commodity (other than one which is a food within the meaning of Section [431.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=431.002)) bear:
    
    (A)  the common or usual name of the consumer commodity, if any; and
    
    (B)  in case the consumer commodity consists of two or more ingredients, the common or usual name of each ingredient listed in order of decreasing predominance, but nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to require that any trade secret be divulged; or
    
    (4)  prevent the nonfunctional slack-fill of packages containing consumer commodities.  For the purpose of this subdivision, a package shall be deemed to be nonfunctionally slack-filled if it is filled of substantially less than its capacity for reasons other than:
    
    (A)  protection of the contents of the package; or
    
    (B)  the requirements of the machine used for enclosing the contents in the package.
