    (c)  Money deposited to the local provider participation fund may be used only to:
    
    (1)  fund intergovernmental transfers from the county to the state to provide the nonfederal share of Medicaid payments for:

    (B)  determines cannot be used to fund the nonfederal share of Medicaid supplemental payment program payments;
    
    (5)  transfer funds to the Health and Human Services Commission if the county is legally required to transfer the funds to address a disallowance of federal matching funds with respect to payments, rate enhancements, and reimbursements for which the county made intergovernmental transfers described by Subdivision (1); and
    
    (6)  reimburse the county if the county is required by the rules governing the uniform rate enhancement program described by Subdivision (1)(B) to incur an expense or forego Medicaid reimbursements from the state because the balance of the local provider participation fund is not sufficient to fund that rate enhancement program.

    Sec. 292D.151.  MANDATORY PAYMENTS BASED ON PAYING HOSPITAL NET PATIENT REVENUE.  (a)  Except as provided by Subsection (e), if the commissioners court of a county authorizes a program under this chapter, the commissioners court may require an annual mandatory payment to be assessed on the net patient revenue of each institutional health care provider located in the county.  The commissioners court shall provide that the mandatory payment is to be assessed at least annually, but not more often than quarterly.  In the first year in which the mandatory payment is required, the mandatory payment is assessed on the net patient revenue of an institutional health care provider as determined by the data reported to the Department of State Health Services under Sections [311.032](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=311.032) and [311.033](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=311.033) in the most recent fiscal year for which that data was reported.  If the institutional health care provider did not report any data under those sections, the provider's net patient revenue is the amount of that revenue as contained in the provider's Medicare cost report submitted for the previous fiscal year or for the closest subsequent fiscal year for which the provider submitted the Medicare cost report.  The commissioners court shall update the amount of the mandatory payment on an annual basis.
    
    (b)  The amount of a mandatory payment authorized under this chapter must be uniformly proportionate with the amount of net patient revenue generated by each paying hospital in the county.  A mandatory payment authorized under this chapter may not hold harmless any institutional health care provider, as required under 42 U.S.C. Section 1396b(w).
    
    (c)  The commissioners court of a county that collects a mandatory payment authorized under this chapter shall set the amount of the mandatory payment.  The aggregate amount of the mandatory payment required of all paying hospitals may not exceed six percent of the aggregate net patient revenue from hospital services provided by all paying hospitals in the county. 
    
    (d)  Subject to Subsection (c), the commissioners court of a county that collects a mandatory payment authorized under this chapter shall set the mandatory payments in amounts that in the aggregate will generate sufficient revenue to cover the administrative expenses of the county for activities under this chapter and to fund an intergovernmental transfer described by Section [292D.103](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=292D.103)(c)(1). The annual amount of revenue from mandatory payments that may be used to pay the administrative expenses of the county for activities under this chapter may not exceed $150,000, plus the cost of collateralization of deposits, regardless of actual expenses.
    
    (e)  A paying hospital may not add a mandatory payment required under this section as a surcharge to a patient.

    (b)  The person charged by the county with the assessment and collection of mandatory payments shall charge and deduct from the mandatory payments collected for the county a collection fee in an amount not to exceed the person's usual and customary charges for like services.
    
    (c)  If the person charged with the assessment and collection of mandatory payments is an official of the county, any revenue from a collection fee charged under Subsection (b) shall be deposited in the county general fund and, if appropriate, shall be reported as fees of the county.

    Sec. 292D.154.  PURPOSE; CORRECTION OF INVALID PROVISION OR PROCEDURE. (a)  The purpose of this chapter is to generate revenue by collecting from institutional health care providers a mandatory payment to be used to provide the nonfederal share of certain Medicaid programs as described by Section [292D.103](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=292D.103)(c)(1).
    
    (b)  To the extent any provision or procedure under this chapter causes a mandatory payment authorized under this chapter to be ineligible for federal matching funds, the commissioners court of the county administering the program may provide by rule for an alternative provision or procedure that conforms to the requirements of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. A rule adopted under this section may not create, impose, or materially expand the legal or financial liability or responsibility of the county or an institutional health care provider located in the county beyond the provisions of this chapter. This section does not require the commissioners court of a county to adopt a rule. 
    
    (c)  The county may only assess and collect a mandatory payment authorized under this chapter if a waiver program, uniform rate enhancement, or reimbursement described by Section [292D.103](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=292D.103)(c)(1) is available to the county.
