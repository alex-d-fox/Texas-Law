    Sec. 297.151.  MANDATORY PAYMENTS BASED ON PAYING HOSPITAL NET PATIENT REVENUE.  (a)  Except as provided by Subsection (e), the commissioners court of a county that collects a mandatory payment authorized under this chapter may require an annual mandatory payment to be assessed quarterly on the net patient revenue of each institutional health care provider located in the county.  In the first year in which the mandatory payment is required, the mandatory payment is assessed on the net patient revenue of an institutional health care provider as determined by the data reported to the Department of State Health Services under Sections [311.032](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=311.032) and [311.033](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=311.033) in the fiscal year ending in 2013. The county may update the amount of the mandatory payment on an annual basis based on data reported to the Department of State Health Services in a more recent fiscal year.
    
    (b)  The amount of a mandatory payment authorized under this chapter must be uniformly proportionate with the amount of net patient revenue generated by each paying hospital in the county.

    (d)  Subject to the maximum amount prescribed by Subsection (c), the commissioners court of a county that collects a mandatory payment authorized under this chapter shall set the mandatory payments in amounts that in the aggregate will generate sufficient revenue to cover the administrative expenses of the county for activities under this chapter, to fund the nonfederal share of a Medicaid supplemental payment program, and to pay for indigent programs, except that the amount of revenue from mandatory payments used for administrative expenses of the county for activities under this chapter in a year may not exceed the lesser of four percent of the total revenue generated from the mandatory payment or $20,000.
    
    (e)  A paying hospital may not add a mandatory payment required under this section as a surcharge to a patient.
