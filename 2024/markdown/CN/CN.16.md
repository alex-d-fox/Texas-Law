    Sec. 6.  APPROPRIATIONS FOR PRIVATE PURPOSES; ANNUAL ACCOUNTING OF PUBLIC MONEY; ACCEPTANCE AND EXPENDITURE OF CERTAIN MONEY FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES.

Money accepted under this subsection is state money.  State agencies may spend money accepted under this subsection, and no other money, for specific programs and projects to be conducted by local level or other private, nonsectarian associations, groups, and nonprofit organizations, in establishing and equipping facilities for assisting those who are blind, crippled, or otherwise physically or mentally handicapped in becoming gainfully employed, in rehabilitating and restoring the handicapped, and in providing other services determined by the state agency to be essential for the better care or treatment of the handicapped.

The Legislature may prohibit state agencies from accepting money under this subsection or may regulate the amount of money accepted, the way the acceptance and expenditure of the money is administered, and the purposes for which the state agencies may expend the money.  Money accepted under this subsection for a purpose prohibited by the Legislature shall be returned to the entity that gave the money.
    
    This subsection does not prohibit state agencies authorized to render services to the handicapped from contracting with privately-owned or local facilities for necessary and essential services, subject to such conditions, standards, and procedures as may be prescribed by law.

An affidavit executed by the owner or the owner's spouse acknowledging that the requirements of Subsection (f)(2) of this section have been met conclusively establishes that the requirements of Subsection (a)(4) of this section have been met.
    
    (g)  An extension of credit described by Subsection (a)(6) of this section may be secured by a valid lien against homestead property if the extension of credit is not closed before the 12th day after the lender provides the owner with the following written notice on a separate instrument:

    If the discussions with the borrower are conducted primarily in a language other than English, the lender shall, before closing, provide an additional copy of the notice translated into the written language in which the discussions were conducted.
    
    (h)  A lender or assignee for value may conclusively rely on the written acknowledgment as to the fair market value of the homestead property made in accordance with Subsection (a)(6)(Q)(ix) of this section if:
    
    (1)  the value acknowledged to is the value estimate in an appraisal or evaluation prepared in accordance with a state or federal requirement applicable to an extension of credit under Subsection (a)(6); and
    
    (2)  the lender or assignee does not have actual knowledge at the time of the payment of value or advance of funds by the lender or assignee that the fair market value stated in the written acknowledgment was incorrect.
    
    (i)  This subsection shall not affect or impair any right of the borrower to recover damages from the lender or assignee under applicable law for wrongful foreclosure.  A purchaser for value without actual knowledge may conclusively presume that a lien securing an extension of credit described by Subsection (a)(6) of this section was a valid lien securing the extension of credit with homestead property if:
    
    (1)  the security instruments securing the extension of credit contain a disclosure that the extension of credit secured by the lien was the type of credit defined by Section [50](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=16.50)(a)(6), Article XVI, Texas Constitution;
    
    (2)  the purchaser acquires the title to the property pursuant to or after the foreclosure of the voluntary lien; and
    
    (3)  the purchaser is not the lender or assignee under the extension of credit.
    
    (j)  Subsection (a)(6) and Subsections (e)-(i) of this section are not severable, and none of those provisions would have been enacted without the others.  If any of those provisions are held to be preempted by the laws of the United States, all of those provisions are invalid.  This subsection shall not apply to any lien or extension of credit made after January 1, 1998, and before the date any provision under Subsection (a)(6) or Subsections (e)-(i) is held to be preempted.
    
    (k)  "Reverse mortgage" means an extension of credit:
    
    (1)  that is secured by a voluntary lien on homestead property created by a written agreement with the consent of each owner and each owner's spouse;
    
    (2)  that is made to a person who is or whose spouse is 62 years or older;
    
    (3)  that is made without recourse for personal liability against each owner and the spouse of each owner;
    
    (4)  under which advances are provided to a borrower:
    
    (A)  based on the equity in a borrower's homestead; or
    
    (B)  for the purchase of homestead property that the borrower will occupy as a principal residence;
    
    (5)  that does not permit the lender to reduce the amount or number of advances because of an adjustment in the interest rate if periodic advances are to be made;
    
    (6)  that requires no payment of principal or interest until:
    
    (A)  all borrowers have died;
    
    (B)  the homestead property securing the loan is sold or otherwise transferred;
    
    (C)  all borrowers cease occupying the homestead property for a period of longer than 12 consecutive months without prior written approval from the lender;
    
    (C-1)  if the extension of credit is used for the purchase of homestead property, the borrower fails to timely occupy the homestead property as the borrower's principal residence within a specified period after the date the extension of credit is made that is stipulated in the written agreement creating the lien on the property; or
    
    (D)  the borrower:
    
    (i)  defaults on an obligation specified in the loan documents to repair and maintain, pay taxes and assessments on, or insure the homestead property;
    
    (ii)  commits actual fraud in connection with the loan; or
    
    (iii)  fails to maintain the priority of the lender's lien on the homestead property, after the lender gives notice to the borrower, by promptly discharging any lien that has priority or may obtain priority over the lender's lien within 10 days after the date the borrower receives the notice, unless the borrower:
    
    (a)  agrees in writing to the payment of the obligation secured by the lien in a manner acceptable to the lender;
    
    (b)  contests in good faith the lien by, or defends against enforcement of the lien in, legal proceedings so as to prevent the enforcement of the lien or forfeiture of any part of the homestead property; or
    
    (c)  secures from the holder of the lien an agreement satisfactory to the lender subordinating the lien to all amounts secured by the lender's lien on the homestead property;
    
    (7)  that provides that if the lender fails to make loan advances as required in the loan documents and if the lender fails to cure the default as required in the loan documents after notice from the borrower, the lender forfeits all principal and interest of the reverse mortgage, provided, however, that this subdivision does not apply when a governmental agency or instrumentality takes an assignment of the loan in order to cure the default;
    
    (8)  that is not made unless the prospective borrower and the spouse of the prospective borrower attest in writing that the prospective borrower and the prospective borrower's spouse received counseling regarding the advisability and availability of reverse mortgages and other financial alternatives that was completed not earlier than the 180th day nor later than the 5th day before the date the extension of credit is closed;
    
    (9)  that is not closed before the 12th day after the date the lender provides to the prospective borrower the following written notice on a separate instrument, which the lender or originator and the borrower must sign for the notice to take effect:
    
    "IMPORTANT NOTICE TO BORROWERS

    (10)  that does not permit the lender to commence foreclosure until the lender gives notice to the borrower, in the manner provided for a notice by mail related to the foreclosure of liens under Subsection (a)(6) of this section, that a ground for foreclosure exists and gives the borrower at least 30 days, or at least 20 days in the event of a default under Subdivision (6)(D)(iii) of this subsection, to:
    
    (A)  remedy the condition creating the ground for foreclosure;
    
    (B)  pay the debt secured by the homestead property from proceeds of the sale of the homestead property by the borrower or from any other sources; or
    
    (C)  convey the homestead property to the lender by a deed in lieu of foreclosure; and
    
    (11)  that is secured by a lien that may be foreclosed upon only by a court order, if the foreclosure is for a ground other than a ground stated by Subdivision (6)(A) or (B) of this subsection.
    
    (l)  Advances made under a reverse mortgage and interest on those advances have priority over a lien filed for record in the real property records in the county where the homestead property is located after the reverse mortgage is filed for record in the real property records of that county.
    
    (m)  A reverse mortgage may provide for an interest rate that is fixed or adjustable and may also provide for interest that is contingent on appreciation in the fair market value of the homestead property.  Although payment of principal or interest shall not be required under a reverse mortgage until the entire loan becomes due and payable, interest may accrue and be compounded during the term of the loan as provided by the reverse mortgage loan agreement.
    
    (n)  A reverse mortgage that is secured by a valid lien against homestead property may be made or acquired without regard to the following provisions of any other law of this state:
    
    (1)  a limitation on the purpose and use of future advances or other mortgage proceeds;
    
    (2)  a limitation on future advances to a term of years or a limitation on the term of open-end account advances;
    
    (3)  a limitation on the term during which future advances take priority over intervening advances;
    
    (4)  a requirement that a maximum loan amount be stated in the reverse mortgage loan documents;
    
    (5)  a prohibition on balloon payments;
    
    (6)  a prohibition on compound interest and interest on interest;
    
    (7)  a prohibition on contracting for, charging, or receiving any rate of interest authorized by any law of this state authorizing a lender to contract for a rate of interest; and
    
    (8)  a requirement that a percentage of the reverse mortgage proceeds be advanced before the assignment of the reverse mortgage.
    
    (o)  For the purposes of determining eligibility under any statute relating to payments, allowances, benefits, or services provided on a means-tested basis by this state, including supplemental security income, low-income energy assistance, property tax relief, medical assistance, and general assistance:
    
    (1)  reverse mortgage loan advances made to a borrower are considered proceeds from a loan and not income; and
    
    (2)  undisbursed funds under a reverse mortgage loan are considered equity in a borrower's home and not proceeds from a loan.
    
    (p)  The advances made on a reverse mortgage loan under which more than one advance is made must be made according to the terms established by the loan documents by one or more of the following methods:
    
    (1)  an initial advance at any time and future advances at regular intervals;
    
    (2)  an initial advance at any time and future advances at regular intervals in which the amounts advanced may be reduced, for one or more advances, at the request of the borrower;
    
    (3)  an initial advance at any time and future advances at times and in amounts requested by the borrower until the credit limit established by the loan documents is reached;
    
    (4)  an initial advance at any time, future advances at times and in amounts requested by the borrower until the credit limit established by the loan documents is reached, and subsequent advances at times and in amounts requested by the borrower according to the terms established by the loan documents to the extent that the outstanding balance is repaid; or
    
    (5)  at any time by the lender, on behalf of the borrower, if the borrower fails to timely pay any of the following that the borrower is obligated to pay under the loan documents to the extent necessary to protect the lender's interest in or the value of the homestead property:
    
    (A)  taxes;
    
    (B)  insurance;
    
    (C)  costs of repairs or maintenance performed by a person or company that is not an employee of the lender or a person or company that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the lender;
    
    (D)  assessments levied against the homestead property; and
    
    (E)  any lien that has, or may obtain, priority over the lender's lien as it is established in the loan documents.
    
    (q)  To the extent that any statutes of this state, including without limitation, Section 41.001 of the Texas Property Code, purport to limit encumbrances that may properly be fixed on homestead property in a manner that does not permit encumbrances for extensions of credit described in Subsection (a)(6) or (a)(7) of this section, the same shall be superseded to the extent that such encumbrances shall be permitted to be fixed upon homestead property in the manner provided for by this amendment.
    
    (r)  The supreme court shall promulgate rules of civil procedure for expedited foreclosure proceedings related to the foreclosure of liens under Subsection (a)(6) of this section and to foreclosure of a reverse mortgage lien that requires a court order.
    
    (s)  The Finance Commission of Texas shall appoint a director to conduct research on the availability, quality, and prices of financial services and research the practices of business entities in the state that provide financial services under this section.  The director shall collect information and produce reports on lending activity of those making loans under this section.  The director shall report his or her findings to the legislature not later than December 1 of each year.
    
    (t)  A home equity line of credit is a form of an open-end account that may be debited from time to time, under which credit may be extended from time to time and under which:
    
    (1)  the owner requests advances, repays money, and reborrows money;
    
    (2)  any single debit or advance is not less than $4,000;
    
    (3)  the owner does not use a credit card, debit card, or similar device, or preprinted check unsolicited by the borrower, to obtain an advance;
    
    (4)  any fees described by Subsection (a)(6)(E) of this section are charged and collected only at the time the extension of credit is established and no fee is charged or collected in connection with any debit or advance;
    
    (5)  the maximum principal amount that may be extended under the account, when added to the aggregate total of the outstanding principal balances of all indebtedness secured by the homestead on the date the extension of credit is established, does not exceed an amount described under Subsection (a)(6)(B) of this section;
    
    (6)  (repealed);
    
    (7)  the lender or holder may not unilaterally amend the extension of credit; and
    
    (8)  repayment is to be made in regular periodic installments, not more often than every 14 days and not less often than monthly, beginning not later than two months from the date the extension of credit is established, and:
    
    (A)  during the period during which the owner may request advances, each installment equals or exceeds the amount of accrued interest; and
    
    (B)  after the period during which the owner may request advances, installments are substantially equal.
    
    (u)  The legislature may by statute delegate one or more state agencies the power to interpret Subsections (a)(5)-(a)(7), (e)-(p), and (t), of this section. An act or omission does not violate a provision included in those subsections if the act or omission conforms to an interpretation of the provision that is:
    
    (1)  in effect at the time of the act or omission; and
    
    (2)  made by a state agency to which the power of interpretation is delegated as provided by this subsection or by an appellate court of this state or the United States.
    
    (v)  A reverse mortgage must provide that:
    
    (1)  the owner does not use a credit card, debit card, preprinted solicitation check, or similar device to obtain an advance;
    
    (2)  after the time the extension of credit is established, no transaction fee is charged or collected solely in connection with any debit or advance; and
    
    (3)  the lender or holder may not unilaterally amend the extension of credit.

    Sec. 59.  CONSERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES; DEVELOPMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATIONAL FACILITIES; CONSERVATION AND RECLAMATION DISTRICTS; INDEBTEDNESS AND TAXATION AUTHORIZED.  (a) The conservation and development of all of the natural resources of this State, and development of parks and recreational facilities, including the control, storing, preservation and distribution of its storm and flood waters, the waters of its rivers and streams, for irrigation, power and all other useful purposes, the reclamation and irrigation of its arid, semi-arid and other lands needing irrigation, the reclamation and drainage of its overflowed lands, and other lands needing drainage, the conservation and development of its forests, water and hydro-electric power, the navigation of its inland and coastal waters, and the preservation and conservation of all such natural resources of the State are each and all hereby declared public rights and duties; and the Legislature shall pass all such laws as may be appropriate thereto.
    
    (b)  There may be created within the State of Texas, or the State may be divided into, such number of conservation and reclamation districts as may be determined to be essential to the accomplishment of the purposes of this amendment to the constitution, which districts shall be governmental agencies and bodies politic and corporate with such powers of government and with the authority to exercise such rights, privileges and functions concerning the subject matter of this amendment as may be conferred by law.
    
    (c)  The Legislature shall authorize all such indebtedness as may be necessary to provide all improvements and the maintenance thereof requisite to the achievement of the purposes of this amendment.  All such indebtedness may be evidenced by bonds of such conservation and reclamation districts, to be issued under such regulations as may be prescribed by law.  The Legislature shall also authorize the levy and collection within such districts of all such taxes, equitably distributed, as may be necessary for the payment of the interest and the creation of a sinking fund for the payment of such bonds and for the maintenance of such districts and improvements.  Such indebtedness shall be a lien upon the property assessed for the payment thereof.  The Legislature shall not authorize the issuance of any bonds or provide for any indebtedness against any reclamation district unless such proposition shall first be submitted to the qualified voters of such district and the proposition adopted.
    
    (c-1) In addition and only as provided by this subsection, the Legislature may authorize conservation and reclamation districts to develop and finance with taxes those types and categories of parks and recreational facilities that were not authorized by this section to be developed and financed with taxes before September 13, 2003. For development of such parks and recreational facilities, the Legislature may authorize indebtedness payable from taxes as may be necessary to provide for improvements and maintenance only for a conservation and reclamation district all or part of which is located in Bexar County, Bastrop County, Waller County, Travis County, Williamson County, Harris County, Galveston County, Brazoria County, Fort Bend County, Montgomery County, or El Paso County, or for the Tarrant Regional Water District, a water control and improvement district located in whole or in part in Tarrant County. All the indebtedness may be evidenced by bonds of the conservation and reclamation district, to be issued under regulations as may be prescribed by law. The Legislature may also authorize the levy and collection within such district of all taxes, equitably distributed, as may be necessary for the payment of the interest and the creation of a sinking fund for the payment of the bonds and for maintenance of and improvements to such parks and recreational facilities. The indebtedness shall be a lien on the property assessed for the payment of the bonds. The Legislature may not authorize the issuance of bonds or provide for indebtedness under this subsection against a conservation and reclamation district unless a proposition is first submitted to the qualified voters of the district and the proposition is adopted. This subsection expands the authority of the Legislature with respect to certain conservation and reclamation districts and is not a limitation on the authority of the Legislature with respect to conservation and reclamation districts and parks and recreational facilities pursuant to this section as that authority existed before September 13, 2003.
    
    (d)  No law creating a conservation and reclamation district shall be passed unless notice of the intention to introduce such a bill setting forth the general substance of the contemplated  law shall have been published at least thirty (30) days and not more than ninety (90) days prior to the introduction thereof in a newspaper or newspapers having general circulation  in the county or counties in which said district or any part thereof is or will be located and by delivering a copy of such notice and such bill to the Governor who shall submit such notice and bill to the Texas Water Commission, or its successor, which shall file its recommendation as to such bill with the Governor, Lieutenant Governor and Speaker of the House of Representatives within thirty (30) days from date notice was received by the Texas Water Commission.  Such notice and copy of bill shall also be given of the introduction of any bill amending a law creating or governing a particular conservation and reclamation district if such bill (1) adds additional land to the district, (2) alters the taxing authority of the district, (3) alters the authority of the district with respect to the issuance of  bonds, or (4) alters the qualifications or terms of office of the members of the governing body of the district.
    
    (e)  No law creating a conservation and reclamation district shall be passed unless, at the time notice of the intention to introduce a bill is published as provided in Subsection (d) of this section, a copy of the proposed bill is delivered to the commissioners court of each county in which said district or any part thereof is or will be located and to the governing body of each incorporated city or town in whose jurisdiction said district or any part thereof is or will be located.  Each such commissioners court and governing body may file its written consent or opposition to the creation of the proposed district with the governor, lieutenant governor, and speaker of the house of representatives.  Each special law creating a conservation and reclamation district shall comply with the provisions of the general laws then in effect relating to consent by political subdivisions to the creation of conservation and reclamation districts and to the inclusion of land within the district.
    
    (f)  A conservation and reclamation district created under this section to perform any or all of the purposes of this section may engage in fire-fighting activities and may issue bonds or other indebtedness for fire-fighting purposes as provided by law and this constitution.

    Sec. 67.  STATE AND LOCAL RETIREMENT SYSTEMS.  (a) General Provisions. (1) The legislature may enact general laws establishing systems and programs of retirement and related disability and death benefits for public employees and officers.  Financing of benefits must be based on sound actuarial principles.  The assets of a system are held in trust for the benefit of members and may not be diverted.
    
    (2)  A person may not receive benefits from more than one system for the same service, but the legislature may provide by law that a person with service covered by more than one system or program is entitled to a fractional benefit from each system or program based on service rendered under each system or program calculated as to amount upon the benefit formula used in that system or program.  Transfer of service credit between the Employees Retirement System of Texas and the Teacher Retirement System of Texas also may be authorized by law.
    
    (3)  Each statewide benefit system must have a board of trustees to administer the system and to invest the funds of the system in such securities as the board may consider prudent investments.  In making investments, a board shall exercise the judgment and care under the circumstances then prevailing that persons of ordinary prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not in regard to speculation, but in regard to the permanent disposition of their funds, considering the probable income therefrom as well as the probable safety of their capital.  The legislature by law may further restrict the investment discretion of a board.
    
    (4)  General laws establishing retirement systems and optional retirement programs for public employees and officers in effect at the time of the adoption of this section remain in effect, subject to the general powers of the legislature established in this subsection.
    
    (b)  State Retirement Systems.  (1)  The legislature shall establish by law a Teacher Retirement System of Texas to provide benefits for persons employed in the public schools, colleges, and universities supported wholly or partly by the state.  Other employees may be included under the system by law.
    
    (2)  The legislature shall establish by law an Employees Retirement System of Texas to provide benefits for officers and employees of the state and such state-compensated officers and employees of appellate courts and judicial districts as may be included under the system by law.
    
    (3)  The amount contributed by a person participating in the Employees Retirement System of Texas or the Teacher Retirement System of Texas shall be established by the legislature but may not be less than six percent of current compensation.  The amount contributed by the state may not be less than six percent nor more than 10 percent of the aggregate compensation paid to individuals participating in the system.  In an emergency, as determined by the governor, the legislature may appropriate such additional sums as are actuarially determined to be required to fund benefits authorized by law.
    
    (c)  Local Retirement Systems.  (1)  The legislature shall provide by law for:
    
    (A)  the creation by any city or county of a system of benefits for its officers and employees;
    
    (B)  a statewide system of benefits for the officers and employees of counties or other political subdivisions of the state in which counties or other political subdivisions may voluntarily participate; and
    
    (C)  a statewide system of benefits for officers and employees of cities in which cities may voluntarily participate.
    
    (2)  Benefits under these systems must be reasonably related to participant tenure and contributions.
    
    (d)  Judicial Retirement System.  (1)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the system of retirement, disability, and survivors' benefits heretofore established in the constitution or by law for justices, judges, and commissioners of the appellate courts and judges of the district and criminal district courts is continued in effect.  Contributions required and benefits payable are to be as provided by law.
    
    (2)  General administration of the Judicial Retirement System of Texas is by the Board of Trustees of the Employees Retirement System of Texas under such regulations as may be provided by law.
    
    (e)  Anticipatory Legislation.  Legislation enacted in anticipation of this amendment is not void because it is anticipatory.
    
    (f)  Retirement Systems Not Belonging to a Statewide System.  The board of trustees of a system or program that provides retirement and related disability and death benefits for public officers and employees and that does not participate in a statewide public retirement system shall:
    
    (1)  administer the system or program of benefits;
    
    (2)  hold the assets of the system or program for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the system or program; and
    
    (3)  select legal counsel and an actuary and adopt sound actuarial assumptions to be used by the system or program.
    
    (g)  If the legislature provides for a fire fighters' pension commissioner, the term of office for that position is four years.

The fund shall contain a program account, an interest and sinking account, and other accounts authorized by the legislature.  To carry out the program authorized by this subsection, the legislature may authorize loans, loan guarantees, and equity investments using money in the Texas product development fund and the issuance of up to $25 million of general obligation bonds to provide initial funding of the Texas product development fund.  The Texas product development fund is composed of the proceeds of the bonds authorized by this subsection, loan repayments, guarantee fees, royalty receipts, dividend income, and other amounts received by the state from loans, loan guarantees, and equity investments made under this subsection and any other amounts required to be deposited in the Texas product development fund by the legislature.
