    Sec. 532.0155.  RURAL HOSPITAL REIMBURSEMENT.  (a)  In this section, "rural hospital" has the meaning assigned by commission rules for purposes of reimbursing hospitals for providing Medicaid inpatient or outpatient services.
    
    (b)  To the extent allowed by federal law and subject to limitations on appropriations, the executive commissioner by rule shall adopt a prospective reimbursement methodology for the payment of rural hospitals participating in Medicaid that ensures the rural hospitals are reimbursed on an individual basis for providing inpatient and general outpatient services to recipients by using the hospitals' most recent cost information concerning the costs incurred for providing the services.  The commission shall calculate the prospective cost-based reimbursement rates once every two years.
    
    (c)  In adopting rules under Subsection (b), the executive commissioner may:
    
    (1)  adopt a methodology that requires:
    
    (A)  a Medicaid managed care organization to reimburse rural hospitals for services delivered through the Medicaid managed care program using a minimum fee schedule or other method for which federal matching money is available; or
    
    (B)  both the commission and a Medicaid managed care organization to share in the total amount of reimbursement paid to rural hospitals; and

    (d)  Not later than September 1 of each even-numbered year, the commission shall, for purposes of Subsection (b), determine the allowable costs incurred by a rural hospital participating in the Medicaid managed care program based on the rural hospital's cost reports submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and other available information that the commission considers relevant in determining the hospital's allowable costs.
    
    (e)  Notwithstanding Subsection (b) and subject to Subsection (f), the executive commissioner shall adopt and the commission shall implement, beginning with the state fiscal year ending August 31, 2022, a true cost-based reimbursement methodology for inpatient and general outpatient services provided to recipients at rural hospitals that provides:
    
    (1)  prospective payments during a state fiscal year to the hospitals using the reimbursement methodology adopted under Subsection (b); and
    
    (2)  to the extent allowed by federal law, in the subsequent state fiscal year a cost settlement to provide additional reimbursement as necessary to reimburse the hospitals for the true costs incurred in providing inpatient and general outpatient services to recipients during the previous state fiscal year.
    
    (f)  If federal law does not permit the use of a true cost-based reimbursement methodology described by Subsection (e), the commission shall continue to use the prospective cost-based reimbursement methodology the executive commissioner adopts under Subsection (b) for the payment of rural hospitals for providing inpatient and general outpatient services to recipients.

    Sec. 532.0351.  TAILORED BENEFIT PACKAGES FOR CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF MEDICAID POPULATION.  (a)  The executive commissioner may seek a waiver under Section 1115 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. Section 1315) to develop and, subject to Subsection (c), implement tailored benefit packages designed to:
    
    (1)  provide Medicaid benefits that are customized to meet the health care needs of recipients within defined categories of the Medicaid population through a defined system of care;
    
    (2)  improve health outcomes and access to services for those recipients;
    
    (3)  achieve cost containment and efficiency; and
    
    (4)  reduce the administrative complexity of delivering Medicaid benefits.
    
    (b)  The commission:
    
    (1)  shall develop a tailored benefit package that is customized to meet the health care needs of recipients who are children with special health care needs, subject to approval of the waiver described by Subsection (a); and
    
    (2)  may develop tailored benefit packages that are customized to meet the health care needs of other categories of recipients.
    
    (c)  If the commission develops tailored benefit packages under Subsection (b)(2), the commission shall submit to the standing committees of the senate and house of representatives having primary jurisdiction over Medicaid a report that specifies in detail the categories of recipients to which each of those packages will apply and the services available under each package.
    
    (d)  Except as otherwise provided by this section and subject to the terms of the waiver authorized by this section, the commission has broad discretion to develop the tailored benefit packages and determine the respective categories of recipients to which the packages apply in a manner that preserves recipients' access to necessary services and is consistent with federal requirements.  In developing the tailored benefit packages, the commission shall consider similar benefit packages established in other states as a guide.
    
    (e)  Each tailored benefit package must include:
    
    (1)  a basic set of benefits that are provided under all tailored benefit packages;
    
    (2)  to the extent applicable to the category of recipients to which the package applies:
    
    (A)  a set of benefits customized to meet the health care needs of recipients in that category; and
    
    (B)  services to integrate the management of a recipient's acute and long-term care needs, to the extent feasible; and
    
    (3)  if the package applies to recipients who are children, at least the services required by federal law under the early and periodic screening, diagnosis, and treatment program.
    
    (f)  A tailored benefit package may include any service available under the state Medicaid plan or under any federal Medicaid waiver, including any preventive health or wellness service.
    
    (g)  A tailored benefit package must increase this state's flexibility with respect to the state's use of Medicaid funding and may not reduce the benefits available under the Medicaid state plan to any recipient population.
    
    (h)  The executive commissioner by rule shall define each category of recipients to which a tailored benefit package applies and a mechanism for appropriately placing recipients in specific categories.  Recipient categories must include children with special health care needs and may include:
    
    (1)  individuals with disabilities or special health care needs;
    
    (2)  elderly individuals;
    
    (3)  children without special health care needs; and

    Sec. 532.0352.  WAIVER PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS.  (a)  If feasible and cost-effective, the commission may apply for a waiver from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or another appropriate federal agency to more efficiently leverage the use of state and local funds to maximize the receipt of federal Medicaid matching funds by providing Medicaid benefits to individuals who:
    
    (1)  meet established income and other eligibility criteria; and
    
    (2)  are eligible to receive services through the county for chronic health conditions.
    
    (b)  In establishing the waiver program, the commission shall:
    
    (1)  ensure that this state is a prudent purchaser of the health care services that are needed for the individuals described by Subsection (a);
    
    (2)  solicit broad-based input from interested persons;
    
    (3)  ensure that the benefits an individual receives through the county are not reduced once the individual is enrolled in the waiver program; and
    
    (4)  employ the use of intergovernmental transfers and other procedures to maximize the receipt of federal Medicaid matching funds.
