    Sec. 2001.0225.  REGULATORY ANALYSIS OF MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL RULES.  (a)  This section applies only to a major environmental rule adopted by a state agency, the result of which is to:
    
    (1)  exceed a standard set by federal law, unless the rule is specifically required by state law;
    
    (2)  exceed an express requirement of state law, unless the rule is specifically required by federal law;
    
    (3)  exceed a requirement of a delegation agreement or contract between the state and an agency or representative of the federal government to implement a state and federal program;  or
    
    (4)  adopt a rule solely under the general powers of the agency instead of under a specific state law.
    
    (b)  Before adopting a major environmental rule subject to this section, a state agency shall conduct a regulatory analysis that:
    
    (1)  identifies the problem the rule is intended to address;
    
    (2)  determines whether a new rule is necessary to address the problem;  and
    
    (3)  considers the benefits and costs of the proposed rule in relationship to state agencies, local governments, the public, the regulated community, and the environment.
    
    (c)  When giving notice of a major environmental rule subject to this section, a state agency shall incorporate into the fiscal note required by Section [2001.024](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001.024) a draft impact analysis describing the anticipated effects of the proposed rule.  The draft impact analysis, at a minimum, must:
    
    (1)  identify the benefits that the agency anticipates from adoption and implementation of the rule, including reduced risks to human health, safety, or the environment;
    
    (2)  identify the costs that the agency anticipates state agencies, local governments, the public, and the regulated community will experience after implementation of the rule;
    
    (3)  describe the benefits and costs anticipated from implementation of the rule in as quantitative a manner as feasible, but including a qualitative description when a quantitative description is not feasible or adequately descriptive;
    
    (4)  describe reasonable alternative methods for achieving the purpose of the rule that were considered by the agency and provide the reasons for rejecting those alternatives in favor of the proposed rule;
    
    (5)  identify the data and methodology used in performing the analysis required by this section;
    
    (6)  provide an explanation of whether the proposed rule specifies a single method of compliance, and, if so, explain why the agency determines that a specified method of compliance is preferable to adopting a flexible regulatory approach, such as a performance-oriented, voluntary, or market-based approach;
    
    (7)  state that there is an opportunity for public comment on the draft impact analysis under Section [2001.029](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001.029) and that all comments will be addressed in the publication of the final regulatory analysis;  and
    
    (8)  provide information in such a manner that a reasonable person reading the analysis would be able to identify the impacts of the proposed rule.
    
    (d)  After considering public comments submitted under Section [2001.029](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001.029) and determining that a proposed rule should be adopted, the agency shall prepare a final regulatory analysis that complies with Section [2001.033](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001.033).  Additionally, the agency shall find that, compared to the alternative proposals considered and rejected, the rule will result in the best combination of effectiveness in obtaining the desired results and of economic costs not materially greater than the costs of any alternative regulatory method considered.
    
    (e)  In preparing the draft impact analysis before publication for comment and the final regulatory analysis for the agency order adopting the rule, the state agency shall consider that the purpose of this requirement is to identify for the public and the regulated community the information that was considered by the agency, the information that the agency determined to be relevant and reliable, and the assumptions and facts on which the agency made its regulatory decision.  In making its final regulatory decision, the agency shall assess:
    
    (1)  all information submitted to it, whether quantitative or qualitative, consistent with generally accepted scientific standards;
    
    (2)  actual data where possible;  and
    
    (3)  assumptions that reflect actual impacts that the regulation is likely to impose.
    
    (f)  A person who submitted public comment in accordance with Section [2001.029](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001.029) may challenge the validity of a major environmental rule that is not proposed and adopted in accordance with the procedural requirements of this section by filing an action for declaratory judgment under Section [2001.038](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001.038) not later than the 30th day after the effective date of the rule.  If a court determines that a major environmental rule was not proposed and adopted in accordance with the procedural requirements of this section, the rule is invalid.
    
    (g)  In this section:
    
    (1)  "Benefit" means a reasonably identifiable, significant, direct or indirect, favorable effect, including a quantifiable or nonquantifiable environmental, health, or economic effect, that is expected to result from implementation of a rule.
    
    (2)  "Cost" means a reasonably identifiable, significant, direct or indirect, adverse effect, including a quantifiable or nonquantifiable environmental, health, or economic effect, that is expected to result from implementation of a rule.
    
    (3)  "Major environmental rule" means a rule the specific intent of which is to protect the environment or reduce risks to human health from environmental exposure and that may adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, or the public health and safety of the state or a sector of the state.
    
    (h)  The requirements of this section do not apply to state agency rules that are proposed or adopted on an emergency basis to protect the environment or to reduce risks to human health from environmental exposure.

    (c)  At the time a state agency files notice of a proposed rule under Subsection (b), the agency shall publish on the agency's Internet website a summary of the proposed rule written in plain language in both English and Spanish in accordance with Section [2054.116](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2054.116).
    
    (d)  For purposes of Subsection (c), a summary is written in plain language if it uses language the general public, including individuals with limited English proficiency, can readily understand because the language is concise and well-organized.
    
    (e)  Failure to publish a summary of a proposed rule in the manner required by Subsection (c) does not invalidate a rule adopted by a state agency or an action taken by the agency under that rule.

    (c)  The state agency must be made a party to the action.

After filing of the district court's request with the court of appeals, transfer of the action may be granted by the court of appeals if it agrees with the findings of the district court concerning the application of the statutory standards to the action.  On entry of an order by the court of appeals granting transfer, the action is transferred to the court of appeals for decision, and the validity or applicability of the rule in question is subject to judicial review by the court of appeals.  The administrative record and the district court record shall be filed by the district clerk with the clerk of the court of appeals.  The court of appeals may direct the district court to conduct any necessary evidentiary hearings in connection with the action.

    (b)  A state agency shall review a rule not later than the fourth anniversary of the date on which the rule takes effect and every four years after that date.  The adoption of an amendment to an existing rule does not affect the dates on which the rule must be reviewed except that the effective date of an amendment is considered to be the effective date of the rule if the agency formally conducts a review of the rule in accordance with this section as part of the process of adopting the amendment.
    
    (c)  The state agency shall readopt, readopt with amendments, or repeal a rule as the result of reviewing the rule under this section.
    
    (d)  The procedures of this subchapter relating to the original adoption of a rule apply to the review of a rule and to the resulting repeal, readoption, or readoption with amendments of the rule, except as provided by this subsection.  Publishing the Texas Administrative Code citation to a rule under review satisfies the requirements of this subchapter relating to publishing the text of the rule unless the agency readopts the rule with amendments as a result of the review.
    
    (e)  A state agency's review of a rule must include an assessment of whether the reasons for initially adopting the rule continue to exist.

During the remand period, the rule shall remain effective unless the court finds good cause to invalidate the rule or a portion of the rule, effective as of the date of the court's order.

    (b)  If a state agency or other party is unable to state factual matters in detail at the time notice under this section is served, an initial notice may be limited to a statement of the issues involved.  On timely written application, a more definite and detailed statement of the facts shall be furnished not less than seven days before the date set for the hearing.  In a proceeding in which the state agency has the burden of proof, a state agency that intends to rely on a section of a statute or rule not previously referenced in the notice of hearing must amend the notice, or the complaint or petition, if applicable, to refer to the section of the statute or rule not later than the seventh day before the date set for the hearing.  This subsection does not prohibit the state agency from filing an amendment during the hearing of a contested case provided the opposing party is granted a continuance of at least seven days to prepare its case on request of the opposing party.
    
    (c)  In a suit for judicial review of a final decision or order of a state agency in a contested case, the state agency's failure to comply with Subsection (a)(3) or (b) shall constitute prejudice to the substantial rights of the appellant under Section [2001.174](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001.174)(2) unless the court finds that the failure did not unfairly surprise and prejudice the appellant or that the appellant waived the appellant's rights.

    Sec. 2001.054.  LICENSES.  (a)  The provisions of this chapter concerning contested cases apply to the grant, denial, or renewal of a license that is required to be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing.
    
    (b)  If a license holder makes timely and sufficient application for the renewal of a license or for a new license for an activity of a continuing nature, the existing license does not expire until the application has been finally determined by the state agency.  If the application is denied or the terms of the new license are limited, the existing license does not expire until the last day for seeking review of the agency order or a later date fixed by order of the reviewing court.
    
    (c)  A revocation, suspension, annulment, or withdrawal of a license is not effective unless, before institution of state agency proceedings:
    
    (1)  the agency gives notice by personal service or by registered or certified mail to the license holder of facts or conduct alleged to warrant the intended action;  and
    
    (2)  the license holder is given an opportunity to show compliance with all requirements of law for the retention of the license.
    
    (c-1)  A state agency that has been granted the power to summarily suspend a license under another statute may determine that an imminent peril to the public health, safety, or welfare requires emergency action and may issue an order to summarily suspend the license holder's license pending proceedings for revocation or other action, provided that the agency incorporates a factual and legal basis establishing that imminent peril in the order.  Unless expressly provided otherwise by another statute, the agency shall initiate the proceedings for revocation or other action not later than the 30th day after the date the summary suspension order is signed.  The proceedings must be promptly determined, and if the proceedings are not initiated before the 30th day after the date the order is signed, the license holder may appeal the summary suspension order to a Travis County district court.  This subsection does not grant any state agency the power to suspend a license without notice and an opportunity for a hearing.
    
    (d)  A license described in Subsection (a) remains valid unless it expires without timely application for renewal, is amended, revoked, suspended, annulled, or withdrawn, or the denial of a renewal application becomes final.  The term or duration of a license described in Subsection (a) is tolled during the period the license is subjected to judicial review.  However, the term or duration of a license is not tolled if, during judicial review, the licensee engages in the activity for which the license was issued.
    
    (e)  In a suit for judicial review of a final decision or order of a state agency brought by a license holder, the agency's failure to comply with Subsection (c) shall constitute prejudice to the substantial rights of the license holder under Section [2001.174](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001.174)(2) unless the court determines that the failure did not unfairly surprise and prejudice the license holder or that the license holder waived the opportunity provided in Subsection (c)(2) to show compliance with all requirements of law for the retention of the license.

    (d)  A state agency may not attempt to influence the finding of facts or the administrative law judge's application of the law in a contested case except by proper evidence and legal argument.
    
    (d-1)  On making a finding that a party to a contested case has defaulted under the rules of the State Office of Administrative Hearings, the administrative law judge may dismiss the case from the docket of the State Office of Administrative Hearings and remand it to the referring agency for informal disposition under Section [2001.056](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001.056).  After the case is dismissed and remanded, the agency may informally dispose of the case by applying its own rules or the procedural rules of the State Office of Administrative Hearings relating to default proceedings.  This subsection does not apply to a contested case in which the administrative law judge is authorized to render a final decision.
    
    (e)  A state agency may change a finding of fact or conclusion of law made by the administrative law judge, or may vacate or modify an order issued by the administrative judge, only if the agency determines:
    
    (1)  that the administrative law judge did not properly apply or interpret applicable law, agency rules, written policies provided under Subsection (c), or prior administrative decisions;
    
    (2)  that a prior administrative decision on which the administrative law judge relied is incorrect or should be changed;  or
    
    (3)  that a technical error in a finding of fact should be changed.
    
    The agency shall state in writing the specific reason and legal basis for a change made under this subsection.

    (f)  A state agency by rule may provide that, in a contested case before the agency that concerns licensing in relation to an occupational license and that is not disposed of by stipulation, agreed settlement, or consent order, the administrative law judge shall render the final decision in the contested case.  If a state agency adopts such a rule, the following provisions apply to contested cases covered by the rule:
    
    (1)  the administrative law judge shall render the decision that may become final under Section [2001.144](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001.144) not later than the 60th day after the latter of the date on which the hearing is finally closed or the date by which the judge has ordered all briefs, reply briefs, and other posthearing documents to be filed, and the 60-day period may be extended only with the consent of all parties, including the occupational licensing agency;
    
    (2)  the administrative law judge shall include in the findings of fact and conclusions of law a determination whether the license at issue is primarily a license to engage in an occupation;

    (4)  the State Office of Administrative Hearings is the state agency responsible for sending a copy of the decision that may become final under Section [2001.144](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001.144) or an order ruling on a motion for rehearing to the parties, including the occupational licensing agency, in accordance with Section [2001.142](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001.142);  and

    (1)  may affirm the agency decision in whole or in part;  and
    
    (2)  shall reverse or remand the case for further proceedings if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are:

    Sec. 2001.175.  PROCEDURES FOR REVIEW UNDER SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE RULE OR UNDEFINED SCOPE OF REVIEW.  (a)  The procedures of this section apply if the manner of review authorized by law for the decision in a contested case that is the subject of complaint is other than by trial de novo.
    
    (b)  After service of the petition on a state agency and within the time permitted for filing an answer or within additional time allowed by the court, the agency shall send to the reviewing court the original or a certified copy of the entire record of the proceeding under review.

The court may assess additional costs against a party who unreasonably refuses to stipulate to limit the record, unless the party is subject to a rule adopted under Section [2001.177](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001.177) requiring payment of all costs of record preparation.  The court may require or permit later corrections or additions to the record.
    
    (c)  A party may apply to the court to present additional evidence.

(a)  A person initiates judicial review in a contested case by filing a petition not later than the 30th day after the date the decision or order that is the subject of complaint is final and appealable.  In a contested case in which a motion for rehearing is a prerequisite for seeking judicial review, a prematurely filed petition is effective to initiate judicial review and is considered to be filed:
    
    (1)  on the date the last timely motion for rehearing is overruled; and
    
    (2)  after the motion is overruled.
    
    (b)  Unless otherwise provided by statute:
    
    (1)  the petition must be filed in a Travis County district court;
    
    (2)  a copy of the petition must be served on the state agency and each party of record in the proceedings before the agency;  and
    
    (3)  the filing of the petition vacates a state agency decision for which trial de novo is the manner of review authorized by law but does not affect the enforcement of an agency decision for which another manner of review is authorized.
    
    (c)  A Travis County district court in which an action is brought under this section, on its own motion or on motion of any party, may request transfer of the action to the Court of Appeals for the Fifteenth Court of Appeals District if the district court finds that the public interest requires a prompt, authoritative determination of the legal issues in the case and the case would ordinarily be appealed.  After filing of the district court's request with the court of appeals, transfer of the action may be granted by the court of appeals if it agrees with the findings of the district court concerning the application of the statutory standards to the action.  On entry of an order by the court of appeals granting transfer, the action is transferred to the court of appeals for decision, and the agency decision in the contested case is subject to judicial review by the court of appeals.  The administrative record and the district court record shall be filed by the district clerk with the clerk of the court of appeals.  The court of appeals may direct the district court to conduct any necessary evidentiary hearings in connection with the action.
