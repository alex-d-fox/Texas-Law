    (1)  40 percent of the evaluation depends on the economic distress of the block group or distressed county in which a proposed enterprise project is located;
    
    (2)  25 percent of the evaluation depends on the local effort to achieve development and revitalization of the block group or distressed county in which a proposed enterprise project is located; and
    
    (3)  35 percent of the evaluation depends on the evaluation criteria as determined by the bank, which must include:

    (g)  The bank may lower the designation level of a proposed project or activity nominated for enterprise project designation:
    
    (1)  if there are fewer designations available than applications received; or
    
    (2)  to further the economic interests of the state.
    
    (h)  A state benefit may not be obtained under this chapter or Chapter [151](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=151), Tax Code, for jobs moved from one jurisdiction in this state to another jurisdiction in this state.
