    Sec. 316.001.  LIMIT.  (a)  For purposes of this subchapter, "consolidated general revenue appropriations" means appropriations from:
    
    (1)  the general revenue fund in the state treasury;
    
    (2)  a dedicated account in the general revenue fund in the state treasury; or
    
    (3)  a general revenue-related fund in the state treasury as identified in the biennial statement required of the comptroller under Section [49a](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=3.49a), Article III, Texas Constitution.
    
    (b)  The rate of growth of appropriations in a state fiscal biennium from state tax revenues not dedicated by the constitution may not exceed the estimated rate of growth of the state's economy.
    
    (c)  The rate of growth of consolidated general revenue appropriations in a state fiscal biennium may not exceed the estimated average biennial rate of growth of this state's population during the state fiscal biennium preceding the biennium for which appropriations are made and during the state fiscal biennium for which appropriations are made, adjusted by the estimated average biennial rate of monetary inflation in this state during the same period, as determined under Section [316.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=316.002).
    
    (d)  For purposes of this subchapter, the following appropriations must be excluded from computations used to determine whether appropriations exceed the amount authorized by Subsection (c):
    
    (1)  an appropriation for a purpose that provides tax relief; or

    Sec. 316.002.  DUTIES OF LEGISLATIVE BUDGET BOARD.  (a)  Before the Legislative Budget Board transmits the budget for the next state fiscal biennium as prescribed by Section [322.008](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=322.008)(c), the board shall establish:
    
    (1)  the limit on the rate of growth of appropriations from state tax revenues not dedicated by the constitution for that state fiscal biennium, as compared to the previous state fiscal biennium, based on the estimated rate of growth of the state's economy from the current state fiscal biennium to the next state fiscal biennium; and
    
    (2)  the limit on the rate of growth of consolidated general revenue appropriations for that state fiscal biennium, as compared to the previous state fiscal biennium, by subtracting one from the product of:
    
    (A)  the sum of one and the estimated average biennial rate of growth of this state's population during the state fiscal biennium preceding the biennium for which appropriations are made and during the state fiscal biennium for which appropriations are made; and
    
    (B)  the sum of one and the estimated average biennial rate of monetary inflation during the state fiscal biennium preceding the biennium for which appropriations are made and during the state fiscal biennium for which appropriations are made.
    
    (b)  Except as provided by Subsection (c), the board shall determine the estimated rate of growth of the state's economy for purposes of Subsection (a)(1) by dividing the estimated Texas total personal income for the next state fiscal biennium by the estimated Texas total personal income for the current state fiscal biennium. Using standard statistical methods, the board shall make the estimate by projecting through the biennium the estimated Texas total personal income reported by the United States Department of Commerce or its successor in function.
    
    (c)  If a more comprehensive definition of the rate of growth of the state's economy is developed and is approved by the committee established by Section [316.005](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=316.005), the board may use that definition in calculating the limit on the rate of growth of appropriations from state tax revenues not dedicated by the constitution under Subsection (a)(1).
    
    (d)  Except as provided by Subsection (e), the board shall determine for the next state fiscal biennium a limit on the amount of:
    
    (1)  appropriations from state tax revenues not dedicated by the constitution by multiplying the amount of appropriations from state tax revenues not dedicated by the constitution for the current state fiscal biennium by the sum of one and the limit on the rate of growth of appropriations from state tax revenues not dedicated by the constitution established by the board under Subsection (a)(1); and
    
    (2)  consolidated general revenue appropriations by multiplying the amount of consolidated general revenue appropriations for the current state fiscal biennium by the sum of one and the limit on the rate of growth of consolidated general revenue appropriations established by the board under Subsection (a)(2).
    
    (e)  If the rate determined under Subsection (a)(2) is a negative number, the amount of consolidated general revenue appropriations for the next state fiscal biennium may not exceed the amount of consolidated general revenue appropriations in the current state fiscal biennium.
    
    (f)  To ensure compliance with this subchapter and Section [22](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=8.22), Article VIII, Texas Constitution, the Legislative Budget Board may not transmit in any form to the governor or the legislature the budget as prescribed by Section [322.008](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=322.008)(c) or the general appropriations bill as prescribed by Section [322.008](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=322.008)(d) until the board adopts:

    (A)  the estimated rate of growth of the state's economy from the current state fiscal biennium to the next state fiscal biennium shall be treated as if it were zero; and
    
    (B)  the amount of state tax revenues not dedicated by the constitution that could be appropriated within the limit established by the estimated rate of growth of the state's economy shall be the same as the amount of those appropriations for the current state fiscal biennium; and
    
    (2)  for purposes of Section [316.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=316.001)(c):

    SUBCHAPTER E. ADJUSTMENT OF STATE FEES IN GENERAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 316.041.  LEGISLATIVE FINDING AND INTENT.  (a)  The legislature finds that, to ensure the efficient operation of state agencies and institutions of higher education and to allow for the assessment of fees adequate to reimburse the state for the costs of state services and regulatory functions, it is in the public interest to provide for the adjustment of state fees by the legislature in the General Appropriations Act.  It is the intent of the legislature that fees be adjusted biennially in the General Appropriations Act in a manner that provides for the recovery of any increased costs to the state resulting from the performance of services and functions for which a fee is levied.  It is the intent of the legislature that, to the extent that senate and house rules allow, each substantive committee shall retain jurisdiction over any adjustment in fees as part of the appropriations process.
    
    (b)  Any increase in the amount of a fee made under this subchapter is for the purpose of recovering, on an annual basis, the costs to the state agency or institution of higher education increasing the fee.  Where fee amounts are increased on a percentage basis, fee amounts may be rounded to the nearest whole dollar.

    (b)  The General Appropriations Act may not specify the amount of a fee unless imposition of that fee is authorized by general law.
    
    (c)  This subchapter does not apply to tuition charged by institutions of higher education.
