    (b)  The attorney general:
    
    (1)  may provide legal services for collection of the obligation;
    
    (2)  may authorize the requesting state agency to employ, retain, or contract with, subject to approval by the attorney general and subject to the agency's compliance with applicable guidelines established by the attorney general, one or more persons to collect the obligation; or

    (c)  The comptroller may employ, retain, or contract with a person other than a full-time state employee to collect delinquent obligations that are owed the comptroller in the comptroller's official capacity, are not collected through normal collection procedures, and do not meet the referral guidelines adopted for collection by the attorney general.  A proposed contract under this subsection shall be reviewed by the attorney general.  A person contracting with the comptroller under this subsection is entitled to a collection fee, as provided under the contract, in an amount not to exceed 30 percent of the full amount of the obligation.
    
    (c-1)  The comptroller may also contract with one or more persons to collect delinquent obligations that have been referred to the attorney general and that the attorney general has returned to the comptroller after exhausting all reasonable collection efforts.  A proposed contract under this subsection shall be reviewed by the attorney general.  A person contracting with the comptroller under this subsection is entitled to a collection fee equal to 30 percent of the full amount of the obligation collected.
    
    (d)  The agency contracting under Subsection (b) or (c) is entitled to recover from the obligor, in addition to the amount of the obligation, reasonable costs incurred in undertaking the collection, including the costs of a contract under this section, in an amount not to exceed 30 percent of the total amount of the obligation.

    (g)  The contracting state agency may provide a person contracting under Subsection (b), (c), or (c-1) any information, including confidential information, that the agency is not prohibited from sharing with another state or with the United States and that is:
    
    (1)  in the custody of the agency owed the obligation; and
    
    (2)  necessary to the collection of the obligation.
    
    (h)  A person acting under a contract formed under Subsection (b), (c), or (c-1) and each employee or agent of that person is subject to all statutory prohibitions against the wrongful disclosure of confidential information that the contracting state agency and its employees are subject to.  A contractor's employee is subject to the same penalties for wrongful disclosure of confidential information as would apply to the employees of the contracting agency.
    
    (i)  The contracting agency shall require a person who contracts under Subsection (b), (c), or (c-1) to obtain and maintain insurance adequate to provide reasonable coverage for damages negligently, recklessly, or intentionally caused by the contractor or the contractor's employee or agent in the course of collecting an obligation under the contract.

(a)  Except as provided by this section, a state agency, as a ministerial duty, may not use funds in or outside of the state treasury to pay a person if Section [403.055](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=403.055) prohibits the comptroller from issuing a warrant or initiating an electronic funds transfer to the person.
    
    (b)  Except as provided by this section, a state agency may refuse to use funds in or outside of the state treasury to pay a person if the person is indebted to the state or has a tax delinquency and the agency is responsible for collecting that indebtedness or delinquency.  This subsection applies only if Section [403.055](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=403.055) does not prohibit the comptroller from issuing a warrant or initiating an electronic funds transfer to the person.
    
    (c)  A state agency may not pay the assignee of a person that the agency may not pay under Subsection (a) if Section [403.055](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=403.055) prohibits the comptroller from issuing a warrant or initiating an electronic funds transfer to the assignee.  The agency may refuse to pay the assignee of a person that the agency may refuse to pay under Subsection (b) if the assignment became effective after the person became indebted to the state or incurred a tax delinquency.
    
    (d)  A state agency that Subsection (a) prohibits from making a payment to a person also is prohibited from paying any part of that payment to:

    (3)  the person's surviving spouse.

    (1)  the person's estate;
    
    (2)  the distributees of the person's estate;  or
    
    (3)  the person's surviving spouse.
    
    (f)  This section neither prohibits a state agency from paying nor authorizes a state agency to refuse to pay a person or the person's assignee if the agency determines that the person is complying with an installment payment agreement or similar agreement between the agency and that person to pay or eliminate the debt or delinquency.
    
    (g)  The comptroller may not reimburse a state agency for a payment that the comptroller determines was made in violation of Subsection (a).
    
    (h)  Subsection (b) does not authorize a state agency to refuse to pay:

    (2)  the agency determines that federal law:
    
    (A)  requires the payment to be made;  or
    
    (B)  conditions the state's receipt of the money on the payment being made.
    
    (j)  A state agency may not refuse to make a payment under Subsection (b) before the agency has provided the person with an opportunity to exercise any due process or other constitutional or statutory protection that must be accommodated before the agency or the state may begin a collection action or procedure.
    
    (k)  Subsection (a) does not prohibit a state agency from making a payment if each state agency that properly reported the person to the comptroller under Section [403.055](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=403.055)(f) consents to the payment.
    
    (l)  This section does not apply to the extent that Section [57.482](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=57.482), Education Code, applies.
    
    (m)  This section applies to a payment only if the comptroller is not responsible under Section [404.046](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=404.046), [404.069](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=404.069), or [2103.003](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2103.003) for issuing a warrant or initiating an electronic funds transfer to make the payment.
