    (d-1)  In allocating low income housing tax credit commitments under Subchapter DD, the department shall, before applying the regional allocation formula prescribed by Section [2306.1115](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2306.1115), set aside for at-risk developments, as defined by Section [2306.6702](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2306.6702), not less than the minimum amount of housing tax credits required under Section [2306.6714](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2306.6714).  Funds or credits are not required to be allocated according to the regional allocation formula under Subsection (d) if:
    
    (1)  the funds or credits are reserved for contract-for-deed conversions or for set-asides mandated by state or federal law and each contract-for-deed allocation or set-aside allocation equals not more than 10 percent of the total allocation of funds or credits for the applicable program;
    
    (2)  the funds or credits are allocated by the department primarily to serve persons with disabilities; or
    
    (3)  the funds are housing trust funds administered by the department under Sections 2306.201-2306.206 that are not otherwise required to be set aside under state or federal law and do not exceed $3 million for each programmed activity during each application cycle.
    
    (d-2)  In allocating low income housing tax credit commitments under Subchapter DD, the department shall allocate five percent of the housing tax credits in each application cycle to developments that receive federal financial assistance through the Texas Rural Development Office of the United States Department of Agriculture.  Any funds allocated to developments under this subsection that involve rehabilitation must come from the funds set aside for at-risk developments under Section [2306.6714](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2306.6714) and any additional funds set aside for those developments under Subsection (d-1).  This subsection does not apply to a development financed wholly or partly under Section 538 of the Housing Act of 1949 (42 U.S.C. Section 1490p-2) unless the development involves the rehabilitation of an existing property that has received and will continue to receive as part of the financing of the development federal financial assistance provided under Section 515 of the Housing Act of 1949 (42 U.S.C. Section 1485).
    
    (d-3)  In allocating low income tax credit commitments under Subchapter DD, the department shall allocate to developments in rural areas 20 percent or more of the housing tax credits in the state in the application cycle, with $500,000 or more in housing tax credits being reserved for each uniform state service region under this subsection.  Any amount of housing tax credits set aside for developments in a rural area in a specific uniform state service region under this subsection that remains after the initial allocation of housing tax credits is available for allocation to developments in any other rural area first, and then is available to developments in urban areas of any uniform state service region.
    
    (d-4)  A proposed or existing development that, before September 1, 2013, has been awarded or has received federal financial assistance provided under Section 514, 515, or 516 of the Housing Act of 1949 (42 U.S.C. Section 1484, 1485, or 1486) may apply for low income housing tax credits allocated under Subsection (d-2) or (d-3) for the uniform state service region in which the development is located regardless of whether the development is located in a rural area.
    
    (e)  The department shall include in its annual low income housing plan under Section [2306.0721](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2306.0721):
    
    (1)  the formula developed by the department under Section [2306.1115](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2306.1115); and
    
    (2)  the allocation targets established under the formula for the urban areas and rural areas of each uniform state service region.
    
    (f)  The department shall include in its annual low income housing report under Section [2306.072](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2306.072) the amounts of funds and credits allocated to the urban areas and rural areas of each uniform state service region in the preceding year for each federal and state program affected by the requirements of Subsection (d).
    
    (g)  For all urban areas and rural areas of each uniform state service region, the department shall establish funding priorities to ensure that:
    
    (1)  funds are awarded to project applicants who are best able to meet recognized needs for affordable housing, as determined by department rule;
    
    (2)  when practicable and when authorized under Section 42, Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. Section 42), the least restrictive funding sources are used to serve the lowest income residents; and
    
    (3)  funds are awarded based on a project applicant's ability, when consistent with Section 42, Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. Section 42), practicable, and economically feasible, to:
    
    (A)  provide the greatest number of quality residential units;
    
    (B)  serve persons with the lowest percent area median family income;
    
    (C)  extend the duration of the project to serve a continuing public need;
    
    (D)  use other local funding sources to minimize the amount of state subsidy needed to complete the project; and
    
    (E)  provide integrated, affordable housing for individuals and families with different levels of income.
    
    (h)  The department by rule shall adopt a policy providing for the reallocation of financial assistance administered by the department, including financial assistance related to bonds issued by the department, if the department's obligation with respect to that assistance is prematurely terminated.
    
    (i)  The director shall designate an employee of the department to act as the information officer and as a liaison with the public regarding each application seeking an allocation of housing funds described by this section.
    
    (j)  Notwithstanding any other law, money provided to this state under the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (42 U.S.C. Section 12701 et seq.) as a one-time lump sum for a specified use:
    
    (1)  is not subject to the allocation requirements under this section or the allocation formula developed by the department under Section [2306.1115](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2306.1115); and
    
    (2)  may be allocated for the benefit of any area of this state in the manner specified under federal law.

    Sec. 2306.142.  AUTHORIZATION OF BONDS.  (a)  Subject to the requirements of this section, the board shall authorize all bonds issued by the department.
    
    (b)  If the issuance is authorized by the board, the department shall issue single-family mortgage revenue bonds to make home mortgage credit available for the purchase of newly constructed or previously owned single-family homes to economic and geographic submarkets of borrowers who are not served or who are substantially underserved by the conventional, Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Federal Housing Administration home mortgage lending industry or by housing finance corporations organized under Chapter [394](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=394), Local Government Code.
    
    (c)  The board by rule shall adopt a methodology for determining through a market study the home mortgage credit needs in underserved economic and geographic submarkets in the state.  In conducting the market study required by this subsection, the department or its designee shall analyze for the underserved economic and geographic submarkets, at a minimum, the following factors:

    (2)  loan volume;
    
    (3)  loan approval ratios;
    
    (4)  loan interest rates;

    (8)  use of subprime mortgage loan products, comparing the volume amount of subprime loans and interest rates to "A" paper mortgage loans as defined by Standard and Poor's credit underwriting criteria.
    
    (d)  The department or its designee shall analyze the potential market demand, loan availability, and private sector home mortgage lending rates available to extremely low, very low, low, and moderate income borrowers in the rural counties of the state, in census tracts in which the median family income is less than 80 percent of the median family income for the county in which the census tract is located, and in the region of the state adjacent to the international border of the state.  The department or its designee shall establish a process for serving those counties, census tracts, and regions through the single-family mortgage revenue bond program in a manner proportionate to the credit needs of those areas as determined through the department's market study.
    
    (e)  Using the market study and the analysis required by this section, the board shall evaluate the feasibility of a single-family mortgage revenue bond program with loan marketing, eligibility, underwriting, structuring, collection, and foreclosure criteria and with loan services practices that are designed to meet the credit needs of the underserved economic and geographic submarkets of the state, including those submarkets served disproportionately by subprime lenders.
    
    (f)  In evaluating a proposed bond program under this section, the board shall consider, consistent with the reasonable financial operation of the department, specific set-asides or reservations of mortgage loans for underserved economic and geographic submarkets in the state, including the reservation of funds to serve borrowers who have "A-" to "B-" credit according to Standard and Poor's credit underwriting criteria.
    
    (g)  The department may use any source of funds or subsidy available to the department to provide credit enhancement, down payment assistance, pre-homebuyer and post-homebuyer counseling, interest rate reduction, and payment of incentive lender points to accomplish the purposes of this section in a manner considered by the board to be consistent with the reasonable financial operation of the department.
    
    (h)  In allocating funds under Subsection (g), the department's highest priority is to provide assistance to borrowers in underserved economic and geographic submarkets in the state.  If the board determines that sufficient funds are available after fully meeting the credit needs of borrowers in those submarkets, the department may provide assistance to other borrowers.
    
    (i)  The board shall certify that each single-family mortgage revenue bond issued by the department under this section is structured in a manner that serves the credit needs of borrowers in underserved economic and geographic submarkets in the state.
    
    (j)  After any board approval and certification of a single-family mortgage revenue bond issuance, the department shall submit the proposed bond issuance to the Bond Review Board for review.
    
    (k)  In the state fiscal year beginning on September 1, 2001, the department shall:
    
    (1)  adopt by rule a market study methodology as required by Subsection (c);
    
    (2)  conduct the market study;
    
    (3)  propose for board review a single-family mortgage revenue bond program, including loan feature details, a program for borrower subsidies as provided by Subsections (g) and (h), and origination and servicing infrastructure;
    
    (4)  identify reasonable capital markets financing;
    
    (5)  conduct a public hearing on the market study results and the proposed bond program;  and
    
    (6)  submit for review by the Bond Review Board the market study results and, if approved and certified by the board, the proposed bond program.
    
    (l)  In the state fiscal year beginning on September 1, 2002, and in each subsequent state fiscal year, the department shall allocate not less than 40 percent of the total single-family mortgage revenue bond loan volume to meet the credit needs of borrowers in underserved economic and geographic submarkets in the state, subject to the identification of a satisfactory market volume demand through the market study.
    
    (m)  On completion of the market study, if the board determines in any year that bonds intended to be issued to achieve the purposes of this section are unfeasible or would damage the financial condition of the department, the board may formally appeal to the Bond Review Board the requirements of Subsection (k) or (l), as applicable.  The Bond Review Board has sole authority to modify or waive the required allocation levels.
    
    (n)  In addition to any other loan originators selected by the department, the department shall authorize colonia self-help centers and any other community-based, nonprofit institutions considered appropriate by the board to originate loans on behalf of the department.  All non-financial institutions acting as loan originators under this subsection must undergo adequate training, as prescribed by the department, to participate in the bond program.  The department may require lenders to participate in ongoing training and underwriting compliance audits to maintain good standing to participate in the bond program.  The department may require that lenders meet appropriate eligibility standards as prescribed by the department.
    
    (o)  The department shall structure all single-family mortgage revenue bond issuances in a manner designed to recover the full costs associated with conducting the activities required by this section.

    (1)  "Bank trustee" means a bank authorized to do business in this state, with the power to act as trustee.
    
    (2)  "Department assistance" means any state or federal assistance administered by or through the department, including low income housing tax credits.

    (B)  maintained by a first lien lender or bank trustee.
    
    (b)  If the department is the first lien lender with respect to the development, each owner who receives department assistance for a multifamily rental housing development that contains 25 or more rental units shall deposit annually into a reserve account:
    
    (1)  for the year 2004:
    
    (A)  not less than $150 per unit per year for units one to five years old;  and
    
    (B)  not less than $200 per unit per year for units six or more years old;  and

    (c)  A land use restriction agreement or restrictive covenant between the owner and the department must require the owner to begin making annual deposits to the reserve account on the date that occupancy of the multifamily rental housing development stabilizes or the date that permanent financing for the development is completely in place, whichever occurs later, and shall continue making deposits until the earliest of the following dates:
    
    (1)  the date of any involuntary change in ownership of the development;

The reserve must be established for each unit in the development, regardless of the amount of rent charged for the unit.
    
    (e)  Beginning with the 11th year after the awarding of any financial assistance for the development by the department, the owner of a multifamily rental housing development shall contract for a third-party physical needs assessment at appropriate intervals that are consistent with lender requirements with respect to the development.  If the first lien lender does not require a third-party physical needs assessment or if the department is the first lien lender, the owner shall contract with a third party to conduct a physical needs assessment at least once during each five-year period beginning with the 11th year after the awarding of any financial assistance for the development by the department.  The owner of the development shall submit to the department copies of the most recent third-party physical needs assessment conducted on the development, any response by the owner to the assessment, any repairs made in response to the assessment, and information on any necessary changes to the required reserve based on the assessment.
    
    (f)  The department may complete necessary repairs if the owner fails to complete the repairs as required by Subsection (e).  Payment for those repairs must be made directly by the owner of the development or through a reserve account established for the development under this section.

    (h)  The duties of the owner of a multifamily rental housing development under this section cease on the date of a voluntary change in ownership of the development, but the subsequent owner of the development is subject to the deposit, inspection, and notification requirements of Subsections (b), (c), (d), and (e).
    
    (i)  The first lien lender shall maintain the reserve account.  In the event there is no longer a first lien lender, then Subsections (b) and (d) no longer apply.
    
    (j)  The department shall adopt rules that:
    
    (1)  establish requirements and standards regarding:

    (i)  maintenance of reserve accounts and reasonable costs of that maintenance;
    
    (ii)  asset management;
    
    (iii)  transfer of money in reserve accounts to the department to fund necessary repairs;  and

    (5)  specify or create processes and standards to be used by the department to obtain repairs for developments;
    
    (6)  define for purposes of Subsection (c) the date on which occupancy of a development is considered to have stabilized and the date on which permanent financing is considered to be completely in place;  and
    
    (7)  provide for appointment of a bank trustee as necessary under this section.
    
    (k)  The department shall assess an administrative penalty on development owners who fail to contract for the third-party physical needs assessment and make the identified repairs as required by this section.  The department may assess the administrative penalty in the same manner as an administrative penalty assessed under Section [2306.6023](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2306.6023).  The penalty is computed by multiplying $200 by the number of dwelling units in the development and must be paid to the department.  The office of the attorney general shall assist the department in the collection of the penalty and the enforcement of this subsection.
    
    (l)  This section does not apply to a development for which an owner is required to maintain a reserve account under any other provision of federal or state law.

Section 145) in each fiscal year, it is the express intent of the legislature that the department shall allocate qualified 501(c)(3) bonding authority as follows:

    (2)  at least 15 percent of the annual issuance amount authorized through the memorandum of understanding provided for in Subsection (b) is reserved for projects in rural areas.
    
    (a-1)  For the purposes of Subsection (a), "rural area" and "metropolitan area" shall be defined through the memorandum of understanding provided for in Subsection (b).
    
    (b)  A qualified 501(c)(3) bond may not be issued unless approved by the Bond Review Board.  In addition, the Bond Review Board shall enter into a memorandum of understanding with the department specifying the amount of bonds to be issued in each fiscal year.  The department and the Bond Review Board shall review the memorandum of understanding annually to determine the specific amount of bonds to be issued in each fiscal year.  The Bond Review Board may not approve a proposal to issue qualified 501(c)(3) bonds unless they meet the requirements of this section, including the memorandum of understanding, and all other laws that may apply.
    
    (c)  In addition to the requirements of Section 145 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. Section 145), a qualified 501(c)(3) organization must:
    
    (1)  demonstrate to the department that the project is carefully and conservatively underwritten to:
    
    (A)  ensure that the project is well run, well maintained, and financially viable;  and
    
    (B)  minimize the risk of the organization's default;
    
    (2)  ensure that at least 60 percent of the housing to be provided under the project is affordable housing provided to individuals and families of low and very low income and:
    
    (A)  at least 40 percent of the units in a multifamily development are affordable to individuals and families with incomes at or below 60 percent of the median family income, adjusted for family size;  or
    
    (B)  at least 20 percent of the units in a multifamily development are affordable to individuals and families with incomes at or below 50 percent of the median family income, adjusted for family size;  and
    
    (3)  enter into an agreement with the department in which the 501(c)(3) organization:
    
    (A)  agrees during the term of the agreement to reserve at least 60 percent of the housing to be provided under the project for individuals and families of low and very low income;
    
    (B)  ensures that the reserved housing will remain affordable to individuals and families of low and very low income during the term of the agreement;
    
    (C)  agrees to not discriminate against a tenant applicant solely because the applicant receives public rental assistance payments, except if at least 15 percent of the housing units provided under the project are occupied by tenants who receive public rental assistance payments;  and
    
    (D)  agrees to restrict the rents charged on those units reserved for individuals and families of low and very low income at 30 percent of the area median income adjusted for family size and utility allowance, unless this requirement is waived or modified on a case-by-case basis by the board, and approved by the Bond Review Board, if both boards determine that the waiver or modification is necessary for an area of the state because the area's median income would prevent the construction of new affordable projects.
    
    (d)  Subsection (c)(3)(C) does not prohibit an organization from requiring a tenant applicant who receives public assistance to meet the organization's standard criteria for occupancy, including such criteria as satisfactory creditworthiness and lack of criminal history.

    (f)  Neither the department nor the Texas State Affordable Housing Corporation may use state or federal money to provide for credit enhancement of a bond issued under this section unless the credit enhancement would facilitate the issuance of bonds for the purpose of financing the creation or preservation of affordable housing by 501(c)(3) nonprofit entities.
    
    (g)  In lieu of complying with the set-aside requirements specified in Subsection (c)(2), a qualified 501(c)(3) organization may comply with such other set-asides or restrictions as are approved by the Internal Revenue Service as a basis for the determination letter addressed to the qualified 501(c)(3) organization.

    (3)  if applicable, the amount of tax credits available to the proposed development.
    
    (d)  In adopting criteria for underwriting applications under this section, the department shall attach additional weight to criteria that will determine the maximum amount that can be awarded that will:
    
    (1)  result in an issuance of private activity bonds for developments serving the lowest income tenants;  and
    
    (2)  produce the greatest number of high-quality units committed to remaining affordable to qualified tenants for extended periods.

    (f)  In evaluating the level of community support for an application under Subsection (b)(1)(J), the department shall award:
    
    (1)  positive points for positive written statements received;
    
    (2)  negative points for negative written statements received; and
    
    (3)  zero points for neutral statements received.
