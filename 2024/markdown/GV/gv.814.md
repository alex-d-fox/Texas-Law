    Sec. 814.107.  SERVICE RETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR CERTAIN PEACE OFFICERS.  (a)  A member who has at least 20 years of service credit as a law enforcement or custodial officer is eligible to retire regardless of age and receive a standard service retirement annuity in an amount and to be funded as provided by this section.
    
    (b)  The standard service retirement annuity payable for at least 20 years of service credit as a law enforcement or custodial officer is an amount computed on the basis of the member's average monthly compensation for the 60 highest months of compensation in the employee class, times the sum of the percentage factor used in the computation of a standard service retirement annuity under Section [814.105](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=814.105) plus .5 percent.
    
    (c)  The standard combined service retirement annuity that is payable under this section is based on retirement on or after the attainment of the normal retirement age, which for purposes of this section is the earlier of either the age of 57 or the age at which the sum of the member's age and amount of service credit in the employee class equals the number 80.  The annuity of a law enforcement or custodial officer who retires before reaching the age of 57 under any eligibility criteria is actuarially reduced by five percent for each year of difference between the member's age at retirement and 57.  The actuarial reduction described by this section is in addition to any other actuarial reduction required by law.
    
    (c-1)  A law enforcement or custodial officer who retires before attaining the age of 50 is entitled only to an annuity that is actuarially reduced from the annuity available at the age of 50 to the law enforcement or custodial officer whose service credit annuity amount is based on the sum of the member's age and amount of law enforcement or custodial officer service credit and employee class service credit, and is not entitled to have the annuity recalculated at normal retirement age.  The standard or reduced annuity under this section is payable from the trust fund established by Section [815.310](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=815.310) and the law enforcement and custodial officer supplemental retirement fund in a ratio determined by the retirement system.
    
    (d)  A member who retires under this section retires simultaneously from the employee class of membership. Optional retirement annuities provided by Section [814.108](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=814.108) are available to a member eligible to receive a service retirement annuity under this section, but the same optional plan and beneficiary must be selected for the portion of the annuity payable from the law enforcement and custodial officer supplemental retirement fund and the portion payable from the trust fund established by Section [815.310](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=815.310).
    
    (e)  The amount payable from the law enforcement and custodial officer supplemental retirement fund is reducible by the amount paid from the trust fund established by Section [815.310](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=815.310) for service as a law enforcement or custodial officer.  The total combined amount of an annuity under this section may not be less than the authorized benefit under Subsection (b) subtracted by any amount necessary because of selection of an optional annuity, because of retirement before the normal retirement age, or as provided by Subsection (f).
    
    (f)  The standard combined service retirement annuity payable for at least 20 years of service credit as a law enforcement or custodial officer may not exceed 100 percent of the average compensation computed under Subsection (b).
    
    (g)  For purposes of this section, service as a law enforcement or custodial officer is creditable as provided by rule of the board of trustees or on a month-to-month basis, whichever is greater.

    (b)  A person who selects an optional lifetime retirement annuity must designate before the selection becomes effective one person to receive the annuity on the death of the person making the selection.  A person who selects an optional retirement annuity payable for a guaranteed period may designate, before or after retirement, one or more persons to receive the annuity on the death of the person making the selection.
    
    (c)  An eligible person may select one of the following options, which provides that:
    
    (1)  after the retiree's death, the reduced annuity is payable in the same amount throughout the life of the person designated by the retiree before retirement;
    
    (2)  after the retiree's death, one-half of the reduced annuity is payable throughout the life of the person designated by the retiree before retirement;
    
    (3)  if the retiree dies before 60 monthly annuity payments have been made, the remainder of the 60 payments are payable to one or more beneficiaries or, if one does not exist, to the retiree's estate;
    
    (4)  if the retiree dies before 120 monthly annuity payments have been made, the remainder of the 120 payments are payable to one or more beneficiaries or, if one does not exist, to the retiree's estate; or
    
    (5)  after the retiree's death, three-fourths of the reduced annuity is payable throughout the life of the person designated by the retiree before retirement.
    
    (d)  If a person who is nominated by a retiree in the written designation under Subsection (b) predeceases the retiree, the reduced annuity of a retiree who has elected an optional lifetime retirement annuity shall be increased to the standard service retirement annuity that the retiree would otherwise be entitled to receive if the retiree had not selected that annuity option.  The standard service retirement annuity shall be adjusted as appropriate for:
    
    (1)  early retirement as permitted by law;  and
    
    (2)  postretirement increases in retirement benefits authorized by law after the date of retirement.
    
    (e)  The increase in the annuity under Subsection (d) begins with the monthly payment made to the retiree for the month following the month in which the person nominated dies or the September 30, 1991, payment, whichever is later, and is payable to the retiree for the remainder of the retiree's life.
    
    (f)  The computation of an optional annuity must be made without regard to the gender of the annuitant or designee involved.
    
    (g)  Except as provided by Section [814.008](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=814.008) or [814.1081](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=814.1081), a person who selected an optional service retirement annuity approved by the board of trustees or an optional service retirement annuity described by Subsection (c)(1), (c)(2), or (c)(5) may not change or revoke a beneficiary designation after the person's effective date of retirement.
    
    (h)  A beneficiary designation that names a former spouse as beneficiary for a guaranteed optional annuity described by Subsection (c)(3) or (c)(4) is invalid unless the designation is made after the date of the divorce.

    Sec. 814.1082.  PARTIAL LUMP-SUM OPTION.  (a)  A member who is eligible for an unreduced service retirement annuity may select a standard retirement annuity or an optional retirement annuity described by Section [814.108](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=814.108) together with a partial lump-sum distribution.
    
    (b)  The amount of the lump-sum distribution under this section may not exceed the sum of 36 months of a standard service retirement annuity computed without regard to this section.
    
    (c)  The service retirement annuity selected by the member shall be actuarially reduced to reflect the lump-sum option selected by the member and shall be actuarially equivalent to a standard or optional service retirement annuity, as applicable, without the partial lump-sum distribution.  The annuity and lump sum shall be computed to result in no actuarial loss to the retirement system.

    (f)  The partial lump-sum option under this section may be elected only once by a member and may not be elected by a retiree.  A member retiring under the proportionate retirement program under Chapter [803](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=803) is not eligible for the partial lump-sum option.
    
    (g)  Before a retiring member selects a partial lump-sum distribution under this section, the retirement system shall provide a written notice to the member of the amount by which the member's annuity will be reduced because of the selection.  The member shall be asked to sign a copy of or a receipt for the notice, and the retirement system shall maintain the signed copy or receipt.
    
    (h)  The board of trustees may adopt rules for the implementation of this section and may authorize the option to be used for a death benefit annuity.  This section does not apply to a disability retirement annuity.

    (b)  The retirement system shall provide the increasing annuity option by reducing the member's annuity for an appropriate implementation period beginning immediately after the member's retirement and annually increasing the amount of the annuity by two percent or by another percentage rate, as determined by the system under Subsection (c), for each year during the applicable implementation period.
    
    (c)  The retirement system may offer other increasing annuity options similar to the option described by Subsection (b), including increasing annuity options providing a different percentage rate of increase or a different implementation period.
    
    (d)  If a member elects to receive an increasing annuity option under this section, the member's annuity must be calculated to reflect the option selected and be actuarially equivalent to a standard or optional service retirement annuity, as applicable, that the member would have been entitled to had the member not elected to receive the option.  The annuity must be computed to result in no actuarial loss to the retirement system.
    
    (e)  The increasing annuity option under this section may be elected only once by a member and may not be elected by a retiree.  A member retiring under the proportionate retirement program under Chapter [803](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=803) is not eligible for the option.
    
    (f)  This section does not apply to:
    
    (1)  a disability retirement annuity; or
    
    (2)  an annuity based on service credited in the elected class.
    
    (g)  Before a retiring member selects an increasing annuity option under this section, the retirement system must provide a written notice to the member of the amount by which the member's annuity will be reduced and the implementation period applicable because of that selection.  The retirement system shall maintain a copy of the notice required under this subsection that is signed by the member.

    SUBCHAPTER D. DEATH BENEFIT ANNUITIES
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 814.301.  SELECTION OF DEATH BENEFIT PLAN BY MEMBER.  (a)  A contributing member who has at least 10 years of service credit in the elected or employee class of membership may select a death benefit plan for the payment, if the member dies while the member is eligible to select a plan, of a death benefit annuity to a person designated by the member.  Death benefit annuities available for selection by a member described in this subsection are the optional annuities provided by Sections [814.108](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=814.108)(c)(1) and (c)(4), payable as if the member had retired at the time of death.
    
    (b)  If a member of a retirement system administered by the board of trustees selects death benefit plans under more than one board-administered retirement system, each plan selected may take effect. If a member selects a death benefit plan under only one retirement system administered by the board of trustees, the plan applies to service credit in other board-administered retirement systems.
    
    (c)  The computation of a death benefit annuity selected under this section must include the ages of the member and the member's designated beneficiary at the time of the member's death.
    
    (d)  A member may select a death benefit plan by filing an application for a plan with the retirement system on a form prescribed by the retirement system.  After selection, a death benefit plan takes effect at death unless the member amends the plan, selects a retirement annuity at the time of retirement, has chosen a plan that cannot take effect, or becomes ineligible to select a plan.
    
    (e)  A beneficiary designation that names a former spouse as beneficiary is invalid for purposes of this section unless the designation is made after the date of the divorce.

If there is no designated beneficiary, the personal representative of the decedent's estate may make the selection for the benefit of the decedent's heirs or devisees.  In lieu of selecting a death benefit plan, the designated beneficiary or, if there is none, the personal representative of the decedent's estate, may elect to receive a refund of contributions and any applicable payment under Section [814.401](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=814.401).
    
    (b)  If a person dies who, at the time of death, was a contributing member of a retirement program administered by the board of trustees and was eligible, having met the requirements of service credit and attained age, for a service retirement annuity based on service in one or more board-administered programs or was a contributing member of the employee class, had at least three years of service credit in that class, and would have been eligible to retire under the proportionate retirement program under Chapter [803](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=803), but was not eligible to select a death benefit plan, the person's surviving spouse may select a plan in the same manner that the decedent could have made the selection if the decedent had retired on the last day of the month in which the person died.  If there is no surviving spouse, the guardian of the decedent's surviving minor children may select a plan.  If the decedent is not survived by a spouse or minor children, an annuity may not be paid under this subsection.
