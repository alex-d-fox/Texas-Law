(a)  The department shall give written notice to each applicant for a handgun license of any denial, revocation, or suspension of that license.  Not later than the 30th day after the notice is received by the applicant, according to the records of the department, the applicant or license holder may request a hearing on the denial, revocation, or suspension.  The applicant must make a written request for a hearing addressed to the department at its Austin address.  The request for hearing must reach the department in Austin prior to the 30th day after the date of receipt of the written notice.  On receipt of a request for hearing from a license holder or applicant, the department shall promptly schedule a hearing in the appropriate justice court in the county of residence of the applicant or license holder.  The justice court shall conduct a hearing to review the denial, revocation, or suspension of the license.  In a proceeding under this section, a justice of the peace shall act as an administrative hearing officer.  A hearing under this section is not subject to Chapter 2001 (Administrative Procedure Act). A district attorney or county attorney, the attorney general, or a designated member of the department may represent the department.
    
    (b)  The department, on receipt of a request for hearing, shall file the appropriate petition in the justice court selected for the hearing and send a copy of that petition to the applicant or license holder at the address contained in departmental records.  A hearing under this section must be scheduled within 30 days of receipt of the request for a hearing.  The hearing shall be held expeditiously but in no event more than 60 days after the date that the applicant or license holder requested the hearing.  The date of the hearing may be reset on the motion of either party, by agreement of the parties, or by the court as necessary to accommodate the court's docket.
    
    (c)  The justice court shall determine if the denial, revocation, or suspension is supported by a preponderance of the evidence.  Both the applicant or license holder and the department may present evidence.  The court shall affirm the denial, revocation, or suspension if the court determines that denial, revocation, or suspension is supported by a preponderance of the evidence.  If the court determines that the denial, revocation, or suspension is not supported by a preponderance of the evidence, the court shall order the department to immediately issue or return the license to the applicant or license holder.
    
    (d)  A proceeding under this section is subject to Chapter [105](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=105), Civil Practice and Remedies Code, relating to fees, expenses, and attorney's fees.
    
    (e)  A party adversely affected by the court's ruling following a hearing under this section may appeal the ruling by filing within 30 days after the ruling a petition in a county court at law in the county in which the applicant or license holder resides or, if there is no county court at law in the county, in the county court of the county.  A person who appeals under this section must send by certified mail a copy of the person's petition, certified by the clerk of the court in which the petition is filed, to the appropriate division of the department at its Austin headquarters.  The trial on appeal shall be a trial de novo without a jury.  A district or county attorney or the attorney general may represent the department.
    
    (f)  A suspension of a license may not be probated.
    
    (g)  If an applicant or a license holder does not petition the justice court, a denial becomes final and a revocation or suspension takes effect on the 30th day after receipt of written notice.

    (5)  submits an application fee that is dishonored or reversed if the applicant fails to submit a cashier's check or money order made payable to the "Department of Public Safety of the State of Texas" in the amount of the dishonored or reversed fee, plus $25, within 30 days of being notified by the department that the fee was dishonored or reversed.
    
    (b)  If a peace officer believes a reason listed in Subsection (a) to revoke a license exists, the officer shall prepare an affidavit on a form provided by the department stating the reason for the revocation of the license and giving the department all of the information available to the officer at the time of the preparation of the form.  The officer shall attach the officer's reports relating to the license holder to the form and send the form and attachments to the appropriate division of the department at its Austin headquarters not later than the fifth working day after the date the form is prepared.  The officer shall send a copy of the form and the attachments to the license holder.  If the license holder has not surrendered the license or the license was not seized as evidence, the license holder shall surrender the license to the appropriate division of the department not later than the 10th day after the date the license holder receives the notice of revocation from the department, unless the license holder requests a hearing from the department.  The license holder may request that the justice court in the justice court precinct in which the license holder resides review the revocation as provided by Section [411.180](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=411.180).  If a request is made for the justice court to review the revocation and hold a hearing, the license holder shall surrender the license on the date an order of revocation is entered by the justice court.
    
    (c)  A license holder whose license is revoked for a reason listed in Subsections (a)(1)-(4) may reapply as a new applicant for the issuance of a license under this subchapter after the second anniversary of the date of the revocation if the cause for revocation does not exist on the date of the second anniversary.  If the cause for revocation exists on the date of the second anniversary after the date of revocation, the license holder may not apply for a new license until the cause for revocation no longer exists and has not existed for a period of two years.
    
    (d)  A license holder whose license is revoked under Subsection (a)(5) may reapply for an original or renewed license at any time, provided the application fee and a dishonored payment charge of $25 is paid by cashier's check or money order made payable to the "Texas Department of Public Safety."

    (d)  Except as provided by Subsection (e), only a qualified handgun instructor may administer the proficiency examination to obtain a license.  The proficiency examination must include:
    
    (1)  a written section on the subjects listed in Subsection (b); and
    
    (2)  a physical demonstration of proficiency in the use of one or more handguns and in handgun safety procedures.
    
    (d-1)  A qualified handgun instructor shall require an applicant who successfully completed an online version of the classroom instruction part of the handgun proficiency course to complete not less than one hour but not more than two hours of the range instruction part of the handgun proficiency course before allowing a physical demonstration of handgun proficiency as described by Subsection (d)(2).

The qualified handgun instructor or approved online course provider shall keep a record of all information required by department rule.
    
    (k)  A qualified handgun instructor may submit to the department a written recommendation for disapproval of the application for a license or modification of a license, accompanied by an affidavit stating personal knowledge or naming persons with personal knowledge of facts that lead the instructor to believe that an applicant does not possess the required handgun proficiency.  The department may use a written recommendation submitted under this subsection as the basis for denial of a license only if the department determines that the recommendation is made in good faith and is supported by a preponderance of the evidence.  The department shall make a determination under this subsection not later than the 45th day after the date the department receives the written recommendation.
