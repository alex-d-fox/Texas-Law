    (c)  The board of trustees, acting on the recommendations of the investment officer, may contract with private professional investment managers to assist in investing the assets of the retirement system.

    (e)  The assets of the retirement system may be held in the name of agents, nominees, depository trust companies, or other entities designated by the board of trustees.  The records and all relevant reports or accounts of the retirement system must show the ownership interests of the retirement system in these assets and the facts regarding the system's holdings.

A subdivision authorized to remit amounts more frequently than monthly shall make reports and filings and perform other actions accordingly, and the retirement system shall credit payments accordingly.
    
    (b)  The board of trustees may make an authorization under Subsection (a) by rule applicable to all subdivisions similarly situated or by order applicable to designated subdivisions.

    (b)  A limitation on subdivision contribution rates provided by this subtitle does not apply to the rate of the contribution to the optional group term life fund.
    
    (c)  At the time of each investigation of members' mortality and service experience required by Section [845.110](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=845.110), the actuary shall investigate the mortality experience of the members and eligible annuitants participating in the program.  On the basis of the result of that investigation, the actuary shall recommend to the board of trustees rates and tables necessary to determine optional group term life program contribution rates.  The rates and tables may provide for the anticipated mortality experience of the persons covered under the program and for a contingency reserve.
    
    (d)  Before a subdivision's participation date in the program and before January 1 of each subsequent year, the actuary shall compute, on the basis of rates and tables adopted by the board of trustees, the contribution rate of a subdivision participating in the program.  The rate must be expressed as a percentage of the compensation of members employed by the subdivision.  When the rate is approved by the board of trustees, the rate is effective for the calendar year for which it was approved.
    
    (e)  The board of trustees, in the exercise of its discretion to manage the assets of the retirement system, may lend money to the optional group term life fund if the amount in the fund is insufficient to pay the benefits due.  Any loan is an investment of the retirement system and must be repaid solely from future contributions to the fund and its share of trust earnings.  The terms of the loan shall be set by the board of trustees, but the loan must bear a commercially reasonable interest rate.  The board may adjust future contributions to the fund for purposes of repayment of the loan.
    
    (f)  To protect against adverse claim experience, the board of trustees may secure reinsurance from one or more stock insurance companies doing business in this state if the board determines that reinsurance is necessary.  The retirement system shall pay the premiums for reinsurance from the optional group term life fund.

The penalty for a past-due monthly remission is equal to interest on the past-due amounts for each day past due at a nominal interest rate of 12 percent, plus a $500 administrative fee.  If the penalty is not paid within three months after the date notice of the penalty has been sent to the subdivision, the retirement system shall deduct the penalty from the subdivision's account in the subdivision accumulation fund.  The interest portion of the penalty shall be deposited by the retirement system in the distributable income account of the income fund.  The administrative fee portion of the penalty shall be deposited by the retirement system in the expense fund.
    
    (b)  Payments and required reports are considered to be made when received by the retirement system.
    
    (c)  A penalty will not be assessed under this section for a late payment or report made in a document sent to the correct address:
    
    (1)  by certified mail, return receipt requested, not later than the 10th day of the month in which the payment or report becomes due;  or
    
    (2)  using a same-day or overnight delivery method, approved by the board of trustees, not later than the 14th day of the month in which the payment or report becomes due.
    
    (d)  If the retirement system does not receive a payment or report, a penalty will not be assessed under this section if the subdivision provides proof satisfactory to the system that the document containing the payment or report was sent in accordance with Subsection (c).
    
    (e)  The retirement system may extend the due date provided by this section if a subdivision applies for an extension before the due date and the director determines that good cause exists for the extension and that the need for the extension is not caused by neglect, indifference, or lack of diligence.

    Sec. 845.505.  UNDISTRIBUTED BENEFITS.  (a)  If a person's membership in the retirement system has terminated and a valid application for a retirement annuity or a refund of accumulated contributions has not been filed with the retirement system, the retirement system shall mail the notice described by Subsection (b) to the most recent address of the former member as shown on system records and make reasonable efforts to locate any person entitled to apply for the benefit.
    
    (b)  A notice under this section must include the name of the former member, the name of each subdivision with which the former member has an individual account, a statement that no additional interest is credited after a membership has terminated, a statement that a benefit is payable, and a statement of the procedure for obtaining payment of that benefit.
    
    (c)  If a person files with the retirement system a valid application for an annuity based on a membership that terminated under Section [842.109](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=842.109)(b), the retirement system shall pay an annuity computed as of the former member's effective retirement date as determined under that section.
    
    (d)  An applicant who is a former member may select the standard retirement annuity or an optional retirement annuity under Section [844.0041](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=844.0041)(c) or (d).  An applicant who is the surviving beneficiary or the personal representative of a deceased former member may select an annuity payable in a form authorized by the board of trustees under Section [844.407](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=844.407).  All annuity payments that previously would have been paid if the annuity had begun on the effective retirement date will be paid to the applicant.
    
    (e)  If a person files with the retirement system a valid application for a refund of a former member's accumulated contributions or a valid application for a benefit payable under the optional group term life program, the retirement system shall pay to the applicant the portion of the former member's accumulated contributions or the portion of the optional group term life benefits to which the applicant is entitled.
    
    (f)  If a person eligible to receive a benefit fails to provide accurate and verifiable information regarding the identity, age, taxpayer identification number, or residential address of the person or the person's beneficiary, the retirement system may hold or delay payment of any benefit until the information is provided.  If a person receiving an annuity fails to negotiate two or more annuity payments, fails to respond to a written request for information relevant to the annuitant's continuing right to receive benefits or relevant to the responsibility of the system to report accurately the distribution under federal or state law, fails to provide the system with an address for the delivery of a benefit that is safe and secure from loss, theft, or misdelivery, or fails in any other manner that interferes with or impedes the efficient administration of the system, the system may suspend and hold all benefit payments until the failure is corrected.
    
    (f-1)  If there is a continuation of an optional annuity, the retirement system shall pay to the person receiving the continuing annuity any amount held by the system to which the deceased person was entitled.  If the annuity terminates with the death of the person, any amount held by the retirement system to which a deceased person was entitled is payable under rules and procedures adopted by the board of trustees.
    
    (g)  If a benefit becomes payable as the result of the death of a person receiving an annuity, the retirement system shall mail a notice similar to the notice described by Subsection (b) to the most recent address of the decedent's beneficiary as shown on system records and make reasonable efforts to locate each person to whom the benefit is payable. After receipt of a valid application, the retirement system shall pay the applicant the benefit to which the applicant is entitled.  All annuity payments that would previously have been paid if the annuity had begun on the date required under this subtitle will be paid to the applicant.
    
    (h)  A person entitled to a benefit under this section is solely responsible for a tax or penalty relating to the distribution of the benefit without regard to whether the person received notice from the retirement system.
    
    (i)  The board of trustees may adopt rules concerning the notice, distribution, management, transfer, and administration of unclaimed, held, delayed, and suspended benefits, the authority of an applicant to act as trustee of an absent beneficiary in the selection of a payment option or receipt of an absent beneficiary's benefit under this section, and the distribution of benefits to an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order with respect to a terminated membership.

The board shall state in writing the specific reason for its determination and may adopt rules for the implementation of this subsection.  The board may delegate its authority under this subsection to the  director.
    
    (f)  Notwithstanding Subsections (d) and (e), the retirement system and a person aggrieved by a decision of the system may at any time informally negotiate an award of benefits.  Negotiated benefits may not exceed the maximum benefits otherwise available or required by law.
    
    (g)  A final decision of the board of trustees in a contested case under this section is subject to judicial review under Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001).
