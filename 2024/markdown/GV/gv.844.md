    Sec. 844.0041.  OPTIONAL RETIREMENT ANNUITIES.  (a)  Instead of the standard retirement annuity payable under Section [844.004](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=844.004), a retiring member may receive an optional retirement annuity under this section or an optional retirement annuity in another form authorized by the board of trustees.
    
    (b)  At a member's effective retirement date, an optional retirement annuity is actuarially equivalent to the standard retirement annuity to which the member is entitled.
    
    (c)  An optional retirement annuity under this section is:
    
    (1)  a retirement annuity that is payable monthly throughout the life of a retiree, and after the retiree's death, throughout the life of an individual designated by the retiree; or
    
    (2)  a monthly retirement annuity that is payable throughout the life of a retiree and, if the retiree dies before 180 monthly payments have been made, the remainder of the 180 monthly payments are payable to the retiree's beneficiary or, if a beneficiary does not exist, to the retiree's spouse or, if no surviving spouse exists, to the retiree's estate.
    
    (d)  The board of trustees by rule may authorize additional forms of optional retirement annuities, each of which must be actuarially equivalent to the standard retirement annuity to which the retiree is entitled as of the effective retirement date.
    
    
    
    
    Added by Acts 2007, 80th Leg., R.S., Ch. 873 (H.B. [1587](http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/80R/billtext/html/HB01587F.HTM)), Sec. 30, eff. January 1, 2008.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 844.0042.  AUTHORITY TO PAY BENEFITS UNDER ALTERNATE FORMS.  (a)  The board of trustees may authorize the payment of the benefit that is due a recipient to be made as a lump sum or in another alternate form that is actuarially equivalent to the benefit that would otherwise be payable to the recipient at the time payments to the recipient would begin.  An authorization under this subsection may be made as a policy of general application or may be made on a case-by-case basis considering the particular facts and circumstances.
    
    (b)  Payment to a retiree in a lump sum or other alternate form may not be made without the retiree's consent if the payment is to be sent to an address in the United States and the present value of the retiree's benefit exceeds a minimum amount set by the board of trustees.  A retiree who receives payment in a lump sum or other alternate form under this section continues as a retiree for purposes of a benefit provided by the subdivision under the optional group term life program.
    
    (c)  Except as otherwise limited under Subsection (b), payment under this section is within the exclusive discretion of the board of trustees, and payment in a lump sum or other alternate form constitutes full satisfaction of the retirement benefit otherwise owed to the recipient.

    Sec. 844.005.  WHEN ANNUITY IS PAYABLE;  CHANGES BEFORE FIRST PAYMENT.  (a)  A retiree may revoke an application for retirement, change the retiree's choice of retirement annuity payment plans, or change the designation of beneficiary after the retiree's effective date of retirement by filing written notice with the retirement system not later than the last day of the month a benefit payment is first made.  After that day, a retiree may not revoke the application for retirement, change the annuity payment plan selected, or change the designated beneficiary except under Section [844.006](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=844.006).
    
    (b)  If an applicant for retirement dies on or before the last day that the application for retirement could have been revoked under Subsection (a), the decedent's application for retirement is considered canceled, except that the valid beneficiary designations made in connection with the retirement application remain in effect.  The beneficiary of a decedent who had been an eligible member under Section [844.407](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=844.407) may receive an annuity in accordance with that section.
    
    (b-1)  Under rules established by the board of trustees, the retirement system may cancel an application for retirement if the applicant fails to timely provide all information and forms necessary to put the retirement into effect.
    
    (c)  An annuity under this subtitle is payable to a retiree or beneficiary through the month in which the retiree or beneficiary dies.  A continuation of an optional annuity begins with payment for the month following the month in which death occurs.

    Sec. 844.006.  CHANGE OF BENEFICIARY OR DIVISION OF BENEFIT FOR CERTAIN PERSONS RECEIVING MONTHLY BENEFITS.  (a)  A retiree who is receiving payments under a  retirement annuity computed on the life of the retiree only may revoke any existing selection and designation of beneficiary nominated to receive any payments that may become due under the annuity after the retiree's death and may select a new beneficiary to whom payments may be made.
    
    (b)  A person who, as beneficiary of a deceased retiree, is receiving monthly payments of any fixed-term annuity described by Subsection (a) may select and designate a person to whom shall be paid any monthly payments that may become due under the annuity after the death of the beneficiary making the designation.  If a valid beneficiary designation is not on file with the retirement system, any monthly payments that become due after the death of the beneficiary are payable to the beneficiary's spouse or, if no surviving spouse exists, to the beneficiary's estate.
    
    (c)  A retiree who is receiving payments under a retirement annuity computed on the joint lives of the retiree and the retiree's designated beneficiary may revoke the designation of the beneficiary to receive the annuity on the death of the retiree, if a court of competent jurisdiction in a divorce proceeding involving the retiree and beneficiary awards to the retiree the entire retirement benefit earned by the retiree.  The order awarding the retirement benefit may be set forth in the divorce decree or in an order approving the terms of a property settlement agreement incident to the divorce of the retiree and beneficiary but must be dated on or after December 31, 1999.  The revocation takes effect when the retirement system receives it and cancels the optional annuity selection made by the retiree.  Beginning with the month following the month in which the retirement system receives the notice of revocation, the retiree is entitled to receive a standard retirement annuity in the same amount that the retiree would receive for the same month if the retiree had originally retired with a standard retirement annuity.
    
    (d)  The benefit payable to a retiree who is receiving payments of a standard or optional retirement annuity may be divided by the retirement system into two annuities in accordance with the terms of a model qualified domestic relations order adopted by the board of trustees by rule.
    
    (e)  The division of an annuity under Subsection (d) is effective when the order is determined by the retirement system to be a qualified domestic relations order, and the amount of each of the two annuities shall be computed by the retirement system at that time, based on tables that have been adopted by the retirement system and in effect at that time, so that the two annuities are actuarially equivalent at the time of division to the annuity being divided.
    
    (f)  The board of trustees has sole authority and discretion to specify the terms and format that are required for a domestic relations order to be acceptable for purposes of this section, to require strict compliance for qualification, and to define the terms and features of the benefit awarded an alternate payee under the order.  The board by rule may establish requirements for forms, documentation, and procedures necessary or desirable for the administration of this section.

    Sec. 844.008.  LIMITATION ON PAYMENT OF BENEFITS.  (a)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle, the benefit payable to a retiree of the retirement system may not exceed the maximum benefit permitted under Section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as adjusted in accordance with Section 415(d) of that code.  Any adjustments are applicable to the postretirement benefits of retirees as well as to the benefits of retiring members.  For the purpose of determining whether the benefit of a retiring member or retiree exceeds the limitations provided in this section, all defined benefit plans of the employer and of entities required to be aggregated with the employer for purposes of Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 are to be treated as one defined benefit plan for purposes of Section 415 of that code.  The limitation year for determining maximum benefits is the calendar year.
    
    (b)  An employer may not provide employee retirement benefits under a defined benefit plan other than the retirement system to the extent that the provision of the benefits, when considered together with the benefits provided under the retirement system, would result in the failure of the retirement system to meet any of the limitation requirements of Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and the benefits of the other plan will automatically be reduced, eliminated, or adjusted to the extent necessary to prevent the failure.

    (f)  The amount of a lump-sum distribution made under this section is considered to be an annuity payment for the purpose of determining whether the amount in the retiree's individual account in the employees saving fund available for distribution at the time of retirement exceeds the total amount of annuity payments made.

    Sec. 844.208.  OPTIONAL INCREASE IN RETIREMENT ANNUITIES.  (a)  The governing body of a participating subdivision, from time to time but not more frequently than once in each 12-month period, may provide for increased annuities to be paid to retirees and beneficiaries of deceased retirees of the subdivision.  An annuity increased under this section replaces any annuity or increased annuity previously granted to the same person.
    
    (b)  The amount of annuity increase under this section is computed as the sum of the basic and supplemental annuities on the effective date of retirement of the person on whose service the annuities are based and is computed as if the person had selected a standard retirement annuity on the person's effective date of retirement, multiplied by:
    
    (1)  the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor, from December of the year immediately preceding the effective date of the person's retirement to the December that is 13 months before the month in which the effective date of the order or resolution providing the increase occurs; and
    
    (2)  a fraction, specified by the governing body in the order or resolution, that is not less than 10 percent nor more than 100 percent and is a multiple of 10 percent.
    
    (c)  The effective date of an order or resolution under this section is January 1 of the year that begins after the year in which the governing body adopts and notifies the retirement system of the order or resolution.
    
    (d)  An increase in an annuity that was reduced because of an option selection or partial lump-sum distribution is reducible in the same proportion and in the same manner that the original annuity was reduced.
    
    (e)  If a computation under Subsection (b) does not result in an increase in the amount of annuity, the amount of the annuity may not be changed under this section.
    
    (f)  The amount by which an increase under this section exceeds all previously granted increases to an annuitant is payable as a supplemental annuity, is an obligation of the subdivision's account in the subdivision accumulation fund, and is subject to reduction under Section [845.307](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=845.307)(c).

    (c)  The amount of annuity increase under this section is computed as the sum of the person's basic and supplemental annuities on the effective date of the increase multiplied by the integer percentage increase specified by the governing body for all annuitants in the order or resolution adopting the increase.  The specified percentage increase may not exceed the percentage established by the board of trustees as the maximum allowable percentage increase.

    Sec. 844.404.  PERSON CAUSING DEATH OF MEMBER OR ANNUITANT.  (a)  A benefit, including any optional group term life benefit, payable on the death of a member or annuitant may not be paid to a person convicted of causing that death but instead is payable to a person who would be entitled under this subtitle to the benefit had the convicted person predeceased the decedent.  If no person would be entitled to the benefit, the benefit is payable to the decedent's estate.
    
    (b)  The retirement system is not required to change the recipient of benefits under this section unless it receives actual notice of the conviction of a beneficiary.  However, the retirement system may delay payment of a benefit payable on the death of a member or annuitant pending the results of a criminal investigation and of legal proceedings relating to the cause of death.
    
    (c)  The retirement system is not liable for any benefit paid to a convicted person before the date the system receives actual notice of the conviction, and any payment made before that date is a complete discharge of the system's obligation with regard to that benefit payment.  The convicted person holds all payments received in constructive trust for the rightful recipient.
    
    (d)  If an annuity is in pay status, the retirement system shall pay in a lump sum the actuarial equivalent of the remainder of any annuity or payments that would otherwise have been payable to the convicted person to the person entitled to the benefit under Subsection (a) or to the decedent's estate.  The time of the actuarial equivalence is the earlier of the time the retirement system receives the notice of the conviction under Subsection (b) or the time the retirement system begins the delay in payment of a benefit under Subsection (b).
    
    (e)  For the purposes of this section, a person has been convicted of causing the death of a member or annuitant if the person:
    
    (1)  has pleaded guilty or nolo contendere to or has been found guilty by a court of competent jurisdiction of an offense at the trial of which it is established that the person's intentional, knowing, or reckless act or omission resulted in the death of a person who was a member or annuitant, regardless of whether sentence is imposed or probated;  and
    
    (2)  has no appeal of the conviction pending and the time provided for appeal has expired.

If a trust is designated beneficiary, the beneficiary of the trust is considered the designated beneficiary for the purpose of determining eligibility for and the amount and duration of benefits.  The trustee is entitled to exercise any rights granted a designated beneficiary to elect benefit options and name subsequent beneficiaries.
    
    (b)  Multiple trusts or a single trust having multiple beneficiaries may not receive benefits to which multiple designated beneficiaries are not eligible under this chapter.

    (a)  In this section "eligible member" means  a member who has four or more years of credited service with one or more subdivisions that are participating in the retirement system.
    
    (b)  Instead of any other benefit allowed under this subtitle other than an optional group term life benefit, an annuity described by this section may be paid on the death of an eligible member who had not filed an application for retirement or whose application for retirement had been revoked or canceled under Section [844.005](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=844.005).
    
    (c)  An annuity under this section is payable to the valid beneficiary designated on the unrevoked form most recently executed by the member and filed with the system naming a beneficiary.  If no valid beneficiary exists or if the member died without having designated a valid beneficiary, the annuity is payable to the deceased member's surviving spouse or, if no surviving spouse exists, to the deceased member's estate.
    
    (d)  Any annuity payable under this section must be actuarially equivalent to the deceased member's benefit accrued under this subtitle determined as of the last day of the month preceding the month of the member's death.  The annuity is payable in the form and manner authorized by the board of trustees.
    
    (e)  An annuity under this section is payable from the same accounts and is subject to the same conditions that are applicable to a service retirement benefit for the same member.

    (b)  If the administrator of a deceased member's estate would be entitled to a refund or an annuity because of the death of the member, the heirs of the deceased member may apply for and receive the benefit if:

The affidavit must include the names and addresses of the heirs and witnesses, establish the facts listed in Subsection (b), include a list of the assets and liabilities of the estate, show the facts that constitute the basis for the right of the heirs to receive the estate, and show the fractional interests of the heirs in the estate as a result of those facts.

    Sec. 844.503.  MEMBER OPTIONAL GROUP TERM LIFE.  (a)  In this section, the terms "regular rate of pay," "hours worked," "salary basis," and "regular salary" have meanings that are consistent with the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. Section 201 et seq.).
    
    (b)  If a person included in the coverage or extended coverage of the optional group term life program dies, a lump-sum supplemental death benefit is payable from the optional group term life fund in an amount equal to the current annual compensation of the member at the time of death.
    
    (c)  The current annual compensation of a member who is not exempt from the minimum wage and maximum hour requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. Section 201 et seq.) is computed by converting to an annual basis the regular rate of pay of the member for the most recent hour worked and proportionately reducing that annual basis if the member is not employed in a full-time position.  The current annual compensation of a member who is exempt from those minimum wage and maximum hour requirements and who is paid on a salary basis is computed by converting to an annual basis the regular salary paid to the member for the most recent pay period of active employment.
    
    (d)  If a member, because of a change in employment, makes contributions to the retirement system during the same month as an employee of more than one subdivision participating in the optional group term life program, a death benefit is payable only on the basis of the member's most recent employment.  If a member, because of simultaneous employment by more than one subdivision, makes contributions to the retirement system during the same month as an employee of more than one subdivision participating in the program, a death benefit is payable on the basis of the member's employment by each subdivision participating in the program.
    
    (e)  The board of trustees by rule may require such proof of compensation and periods of employment as it finds necessary.

    SUBCHAPTER G.  FIXED CONTRIBUTION RATE PLAN
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 844.601.  PLAN FUNDING BY NON-ADOPTING COUNTY.  (a)  This section applies only to a county that began participation in the retirement system before January 1, 1992, and has not adopted the provisions of Subchapter H.
    
    (b)  Except as provided by Subsections (c) and (d), the county shall contribute to its account in the subdivision accumulation fund at the same rate of current service compensation as the employee contribution rate for the county.
    
    (c)  If in any year the retirement system's actuary determines that the contributions of the county to the subdivision accumulation fund under Subsection (b) will not finance the county's obligations to the fund within the closed or open amortization period recommended by the actuary and adopted by the board of trustees for all subdivisions, the governing body of the county shall adopt an order to reduce the amortization period to the maximum period established by the board.  The actuary shall determine appropriate remedies for review and adoption by the county.  An order adopted under this subsection must first be approved by the board of trustees and must require:
    
    (1)  a reduction in the employee contribution rate to a rate not less than four percent of current service compensation;
    
    (2)  additional employer contributions under a supplemental contribution rate as provided by Subsection (e);
    
    (3)  a reduction in the percentage for determining multiple matching credits in five percent increments for contributions made after the effective date of the reduction; or
    
    (4)  any combination of these actions.
    
    (d)  An order adopted under Subsection (c) takes effect on the first day of the calendar year that begins after the date the retirement system's actuary makes a determination described by Subsection (c).
    
    (e)  A supplemental contribution rate under this section is the rate of contribution by the county to its account in the subdivision accumulation fund, in addition to the contributions required under Subsection (b), that the retirement system's actuary determines and certifies is required to amortize the obligations of the county to the subdivision accumulation fund within the established amortization period.
    
    (f)  A county that has not adopted the provisions of Subchapter H may not adopt additional options and may not increase service credits or benefits otherwise allowable under this subtitle except for an increase in the rate of employee contributions  or an increase in the percentage of multiple matching credits to a rate or percentage that does not exceed the rate or percentage in effect on January 1, 2010.

    			Except for a county described by Section [844.601](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=844.601), this subchapter applies to each subdivision that participates in the retirement system.

    Sec. 844.702.  MEMBER CONTRIBUTIONS.  (a)  The governing body of the subdivision may designate the rate of member contributions for employees of the subdivision to take effect beginning on the effective date of adoption of the plan provisions of this subchapter.  The subdivision may elect a rate of four, five, six, or seven percent of the current service compensation of its employees.  The governing body of the subdivision may thereafter increase or decrease the contribution rate to take effect on the next January 1 after the date of adoption of the increase or decrease, in accordance with the provisions of Sections [845.402](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=845.402)(b) and (c).

    Sec. 844.703.  SUBDIVISION CONTRIBUTIONS.  (a)  Each participating subdivision adopting the plan provisions of this subchapter shall pay to the subdivision accumulation fund as its normal contribution an amount equal to a percentage of the compensation of members employed by the subdivision for that month.  The rate of contribution is the normal contribution rate determined annually by the actuary and approved by the board of trustees.
    
    (b)  Each subdivision adopting the plan provisions of this subchapter shall pay to the subdivision accumulation fund, as its prior service contribution, an amount equal to a percentage of the compensation of members employed by the subdivision for that month.  The rate of contribution is the rate determined annually by the actuary and approved by the board of trustees as being the rate required to fund all unfunded obligations charged against the subdivision's account in the subdivision accumulation fund within the subdivision's amortization period without probable future depletion of that account or, if there are no unfunded obligations, the rate required to amortize any overfunded obligations within a period of 30 years.
    
    (c)  The combined rates of a subdivision's normal contributions and prior service contributions under this subchapter may not exceed 11 percent unless the governing body of the subdivision elects to waive this limitation.  A waiver under this subsection becomes effective on January 1 of the year after the year in which it is adopted and remains effective until January 1 of the year following a repeal of the waiver by the subdivision's governing body.
    
    (d)  The actuary annually shall determine the subdivision normal contribution rate and the prior service contribution rate for subdivisions adopting the plan provisions of this subchapter from the most recent data available at the time of determination.  Before January 1 of each year, the board of trustees shall certify the rates of each subdivision that has adopted the plan provisions of this subchapter.  If the combined rates of the subdivision's normal contributions and prior service contributions under this subchapter exceed the rate prescribed by Subsection (c), and if the governing body of the subdivision has not waived that maximum rate, the rate for prior service contributions must be reduced to the rate that equals the difference between the maximum rate prescribed by Subsection (c) and the normal contribution rate.  The governing body may elect to contribute at a rate that is greater than the sum of the subdivision's normal contribution rate and prior service contribution rate as determined under Subsections (a) and (b).  An elected rate may not exceed the maximum rate prescribed by Subsection (c), unless the governing body has elected to waive that maximum rate.  An elected rate remains in effect for each subsequent calendar year until it is rescinded by the governing body.  For years in which the sum of the rates determined under Subsections (a) and (b) exceeds the elected rate, the governing body must contribute the sum of the rates determined under Subsections (a) and (b).  For years in which the elected rate exceeds the sum of the rates determined under Subsections (a) and (b), the prior service contribution rate is increased to the rate that equals the difference between the elected rate and the normal contribution rate prescribed by Subsection (a).
    
    (e)  In addition to the normal contributions and prior service contributions under this subchapter, the subdivision shall make the picked-up employee contributions provided by Section [845.403](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=845.403)(i), and those contributions, along with optional group term life contributions, are not subject to the maximum subdivision contribution rates prescribed by Subsection (c).
    
    (f)  The prior service contribution rate prescribed by Subsection (b) must be based on an open or closed amortization period as recommended by the actuary and adopted by the board of trustees but may not exceed 30 years.  The board of trustees may establish criteria for the circumstances under which a subdivision's amortization period, if closed, will be renewed, extended, or shortened. 
    
    (g)  If the combined rates of the subdivision's normal contributions and prior service contributions under this subchapter exceed the maximum rate prescribed by Subsection (c) before the adjustment prescribed by Subsection (d), and if the governing body of the subdivision has not waived that maximum rate, the actuary shall determine what lower percentage for determining multiple matching credits of future member contributions is necessary to make the combined rates of the subdivision not exceed the maximum rate prescribed by Subsection (c).  The actuary shall give written notice of the determination to the director, who shall give written notice to the governing body of the subdivision.  The lower percentage determined by the actuary and specified in the notice to the governing body becomes effective as to all members who perform current service for the affected subdivision on or after the first day of the first calendar year that begins after the date of the notice, unless before the effective date, the governing body of the subdivision adopts an order or resolution, approved by the board of trustees, authorizing a reduction in the percentage used in determining multiple matching credits in accordance with Section [844.704](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=844.704)(a) or authorizing a reduction in the rate of member contributions in accordance with Section [844.702](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=844.702), or authorizing both a reduction in the percentage used in determining multiple matching credits and a reduction in the rate of member contributions.
    
    (h)  If the combined rates of the subdivision's normal contributions and prior service contributions under this subchapter exceed the maximum rate prescribed by Subsection (c), and if the governing body of the subdivision has not waived that maximum rate, and if all reductions under Subsection (g), in the opinion of the actuary, result in the combined rates of the subdivision remaining in excess of the maximum rate prescribed by Subsection (c), the retirement system shall reduce the rate of member contributions to a lower rate authorized by Section [844.702](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=844.702) that, in the opinion of the actuary, is required to produce a combined rate that does not exceed the rate prescribed by Subsection (c).  At the time the actuary determines that the rate of employee contributions that was in existence before a reduction under this subsection no longer would result in a combined rate in excess of the maximum rate prescribed by Subsection (c), the retirement system shall reinstate the employee contribution to the rate that was in effect at the time of the reduction, unless the governing body of the subdivision has elected to change to some other rate authorized by Section [844.702](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=844.702)(a).  Any change under this section shall be made on January 1 of the year following the applicable determination by the actuary.  During the time that the member contribution rate is reduced, the combined rates of the subdivision's normal contributions and prior service contributions shall be equal to the maximum rate prescribed by Subsection 844.703(c).
    
    (i)  Notwithstanding any provision in this section to the contrary and if approved by the board of trustees, a participating subdivision that has experienced or is anticipating circumstances that cause employer contributions based on covered payroll to be an unreasonable method of funding shall contribute in an actuarially approved method that is reasonable to regularly and consistently fund all of its pension liabilities in the retirement system.

    Sec. 844.704.  BENEFITS.  (a)  The governing body of a subdivision shall select a percentage for determining multiple matching credits of zero or any percentage that is a multiple of five percent and that does not exceed 150 percent.  The governing body may later increase the percentage used in determining multiple matching credits under Section [843.402](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=843.402) to any percentage that is a multiple of five percent and that does not exceed 150 percent, to take effect on the next January 1 after the date the increase is adopted.  In its order or resolution, the governing body may provide that the increased percentage will be used in determining multiple matching credits only for employee contributions made after the effective date of the increase or that the increased percentage will be used both prospectively and retroactively in determining the multiple matching credits for all employee contributions not otherwise matched at a higher percentage.  The governing body may thereafter reduce the percentage used in determining multiple matching credits for contributions made after the effective date of the reduction to zero or any percentage that is a multiple of five percent, to take effect on the next January 1 after the date of the reduction.
    
    (b)  The governing body shall select a percentage for determining allocated prior service credits of zero or any percentage that is a multiple of five percent.  The governing body may increase the percentage used in determining allocated prior service credits, to take effect on the next January 1 after the date of the increase.  The percentage may not exceed one-half of the percentage that results from adding 200 percent to the lowest percentage for determining multiple matching credit currently applicable to any employee contribution with respect to the subdivision.

    (e)  The governing body may not adopt an increase or addition to the subdivision's plan if the adoption would result in the combined rates of the subdivision's normal contributions and prior service contributions for the first calendar year following the adoption exceeding the maximum rate prescribed by Section [844.703](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=844.703)(c), unless a waiver under that section is in effect.
    
    (f)  Other than an order or resolution of initial participation in the retirement system and except as otherwise authorized by the board of trustees, an order or resolution under this section must be filed with the retirement system not later than December 15 of the year preceding the year in which it will take effect and may not take effect until the order or resolution is approved by the board of trustees as meeting the requirements of this section.  An order or resolution adopted after participation begins may take effect only on January 1 of a year.
