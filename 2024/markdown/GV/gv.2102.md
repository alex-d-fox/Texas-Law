    Sec. 2102.002.  PURPOSE.  The purpose of this chapter is to establish guidelines for a program of internal auditing to assist agency administrators and governing boards by furnishing independent analyses, appraisals, and recommendations about the adequacy and effectiveness of a state agency's systems of internal control policies and procedures and the quality of performance in carrying out assigned responsibilities.  Internal auditing is defined as an independent, objective assurance and consulting activity designed to add value and improve an organization's operations.  It helps an organization accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes.
