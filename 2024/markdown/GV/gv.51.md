    (1)  not later than the second business day after the date that the document or instrument is offered or submitted for filing or for filing and recording;  or

    (c)  For purposes of this section, a document or instrument is presumed to be fraudulent if:
    
    (1)  the document is a purported judgment or other document purporting to memorialize or evidence an act, an order, a directive, or process of:
    
    (A)  a purported court or a purported judicial entity not expressly created or established under the constitution or the laws of this state or of the United States; or

    (A)  is not a document or instrument provided for by the constitution or laws of this state or of the United States;
    
    (B)  is not created by implied or express consent or agreement of the obligor, debtor, or the owner of the real or personal property or an interest in the real or personal property, if required under the laws of this state, or by implied or express consent or agreement of an agent, fiduciary, or other representative of that person; or
    
    (C)  is not an equitable, constructive, or other lien imposed by a court with jurisdiction created or established under the constitution or laws of this state or of the United States; or
    
    (3)  the document or instrument purports to create a lien or assert a claim against real or personal property or an interest in real or personal property and the document or instrument is filed by an inmate or on behalf of an inmate.

    (1)  request the assistance of the county or district attorney to determine whether the document is fraudulent before filing or recording the document;
    
    (2)  request that the prospective filer provide to the county clerk additional documentation supporting the existence of the lien, such as a contract or other document that contains the alleged debtor or obligor's signature; and
    
    (3)  forward any additional documentation received to the county or district attorney.
    
    (e)  A presumption under Subsection (c)(3) may be rebutted by providing the filing officer in the filing office in which the document is filed or recorded the original or a copy of a sworn and notarized document signed by the obligor, debtor, or owner of the property designated as collateral stating that the person entered into a security agreement with the inmate and authorized the filing of the financing statement as provided by Section [9.509](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.509), Business & Commerce Code.

    Sec. 51.943.  BASIC CIVIL LEGAL SERVICES ACCOUNT.  (a)  The basic civil legal services account is an account in the judicial fund administered by the supreme court.
    
    (b)  Funds in the basic civil legal services account may be used only for the support of programs approved by the supreme court that provide basic civil legal services to the indigent.  The comptroller may pay money from the account only on vouchers approved by the supreme court.
    
    (c)  Except as provided by this subsection, funds from the basic civil legal services account may not be used to directly or indirectly support a class action lawsuit, abortion-related litigation, or a lawsuit against a governmental entity, political party, candidate, or officeholder for an action taken in the individual's official capacity or for lobbying for or against a candidate or issue.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, funds from the basic civil legal services account may not be used for the representation of an individual who is confined to a local, state, or federal jail or prison.  Funds from the basic civil legal services account may not be used to provide legal services to an individual who is not legally in this country, unless necessary to protect the physical safety of the individual.  Funds from the basic civil legal services account may be used to support a lawsuit brought by an individual, solely on behalf of the individual or the individual's dependent or ward, to compel a governmental entity to provide benefits that the individual or the individual's dependent or ward is expressly eligible to receive, by statute or regulation, including social security benefits, aid to families with dependent children, financial assistance under Chapter [31](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HR&Value=31), Human Resources Code, food stamps, special education for the handicapped, Medicare, Medicaid, subsidized or public housing, and other economic, shelter, or medical benefits provided by a government directly to an indigent individual, but not to support a claim for actual or punitive damages.
    
    (d)  Except as provided by this subsection, funds from the basic civil legal services account may not be used for a lawsuit or other legal matter that if undertaken on behalf of an indigent individual by an attorney in private practice might reasonably be expected to result in payment of a fee for legal services from an award to the individual client from public funds or from an opposing party.  Funds from the basic civil legal services account may be used to support a lawsuit if the indigent individual seeking legal assistance made a reasonable effort to obtain legal services from an attorney in private practice for the particular legal matter, including contacting attorneys who practice law in the judicial district that is the residence of the indigent individual and who normally accept cases of a similar nature, and the indigent individual has been unable to obtain legal services.
    
    (e)  The supreme court shall file a report with the Legislative Budget Board at the end of each fiscal year showing disbursements from the account and the purpose for each disbursement and the sanctions imposed, if any.  All funds expended are subject to audit by the supreme court, the comptroller, and the state auditor.
    
    (f)  The purpose of this subchapter is to increase the funds available for basic civil legal services to the indigent.  Funds available from the basic civil legal services account may be supplemented by local or federal funds and private or public grants.

The comptroller shall deposit the fees to the credit of the basic civil legal services account of the judicial fund for use in programs approved by the supreme court that provide basic civil legal services to the indigent.
