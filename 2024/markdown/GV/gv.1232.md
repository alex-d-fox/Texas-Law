    (e)  The authority and the Public Utility Commission of Texas have all powers necessary to perform the duties and responsibilities described by this section.  This section shall be interpreted broadly in a manner consistent with the most cost-effective financing of stranded costs.  To the extent possible, obligations or evidences of indebtedness issued by the authority under this section must be structured so that any interest on the obligations or evidences of indebtedness is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes.  Any interest on the obligations or evidences of indebtedness is not subject to taxation by and may not be included as part of the measurement of a tax by this state or a political subdivision of this state.
