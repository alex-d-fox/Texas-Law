    (A)  except as provided by Paragraph (B), 150 percent; and
    
    (B)  for the portion of the accumulated account balance based on the member's additional two percent contribution under Section [820.101](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=820.101)(b), including interest, attributable to service as a law enforcement or custodial officer, 300 percent, paid from the law enforcement and custodial officer supplemental retirement fund; and

    Sec. 820.0535.  OPTIONAL CASH BALANCE BENEFITS.  (a)  Instead of the standard cash balance annuity payable under Section [820.053](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=820.053), a retiring member may elect to receive an optional cash balance annuity under this section.
    
    (b)  A person who selects an optional lifetime cash balance annuity must designate, before the selection becomes effective, one beneficiary to receive the annuity on the death of the person making the selection.  A person who selects an optional cash balance annuity payable for a guaranteed period may designate, before or after retirement, one or more beneficiaries to receive the annuity on the death of the person making the selection.
    
    (c)  A person eligible to select an optional cash balance annuity under this section may select an option that provides that:
    
    (1)  after the retiree's death, the reduced annuity is payable in the same amount throughout the life of the beneficiary designated by the retiree before retirement;
    
    (2)  after the retiree's death, one-half of the reduced annuity is payable throughout the life of the beneficiary designated by the retiree before retirement;
    
    (3)  if the retiree dies before 60 monthly annuity payments have been made, the remainder of the 60 payments are payable to one or more beneficiaries or, if one does not exist, to the retiree's estate;
    
    (4)  if the retiree dies before 120 monthly annuity payments have been made, the remainder of the 120 payments are payable to one or more beneficiaries or, if one does not exist, to the retiree's estate; or
    
    (5)  after the retiree's death, three-fourths of the reduced annuity is payable throughout the life of the beneficiary designated by the retiree before retirement.
    
    (d)  If a beneficiary designated by a retiree under Subsection (b) predeceases the retiree and the retiree has elected an optional lifetime annuity, the reduced annuity shall be increased to the standard cash balance annuity that the retiree would have been entitled to receive if the retiree had not selected the optional annuity.  The standard cash balance annuity shall be adjusted as appropriate for post-retirement increases in retirement benefits authorized by law since the date of retirement.
    
    (e)  Any increase in an annuity under Subsection (d) begins with the payment for the month following the month in which the designated beneficiary dies, and the increased annuity is payable to the retiree for the remainder of the retiree's life.
    
    (f)  The computation of an optional cash balance annuity must be made without regard to the gender of the annuitant or designated beneficiary.
    
    (g)  Except as provided by Section [814.008](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=814.008) or [820.0536](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=820.0536), a person who selected an optional cash balance annuity described by Subsection (c)(1), (c)(2), or (c)(5) of this section may not change or revoke a beneficiary designation after the person's effective date of retirement.

    (1)  pursuant to a divorce decree, a court orders the change in the annuity to a standard cash balance annuity; or
    
    (2)  the retiree files with the retirement system a request to change the annuity and, in connection with a divorce between the retiree and the beneficiary designated by the retiree under Section [820.0535](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=820.0535)(b), the beneficiary has executed a written, notarized instrument that:
    
    (A)  releases the system from any claim to the annuity by the beneficiary; and
    
    (B)  transfers all of the beneficiary's interest in the annuity to the retiree.
    
    (b)  If a retiree files a request as provided by Subsection (a), the retirement system shall recompute the annuity as a standard cash balance annuity.  The increase in the annuity under this section begins with the monthly payment made to the retiree for the month following the month in which a request is filed as provided by Subsection (a).

    (b)  The amount of the lump-sum distribution under this section may not exceed the sum of 36 months of a standard cash balance annuity computed without regard to this section.
    
    (c)  The cash balance annuity selected by the member shall be actuarially reduced to reflect the lump-sum option selected by the member and shall be actuarially equivalent to a standard or optional cash balance annuity, as applicable, without the partial lump-sum distribution.  The annuity and lump sum shall be computed to result in no actuarial loss to the retirement system.
    
    (d)  The lump-sum distribution shall be made as a single payment payable at the time that the first monthly annuity payment is paid.
    
    (e)  The amount of the lump-sum distribution shall be deducted from any amount otherwise payable under this chapter.
    
    (f)  The partial lump-sum option under this section may be elected only once by a member and may not be elected by a retiree.  A member retiring under the proportionate retirement program under Chapter [803](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=803) is not eligible for the partial lump-sum option.
    
    (g)  Before a retiring member selects a partial lump-sum distribution under this section:
    
    (1)  the retirement system shall provide written notice to the member of the amount by which the member's annuity will be reduced because of the selection; and
    
    (2)  the member must acknowledge receipt of the notice in writing.
    
    (h)  The board of trustees may adopt rules for the implementation of this section and may authorize the option to be used for a death benefit annuity.  This section does not apply to a disability retirement annuity.

    Sec. 820.103.  GAIN SHARING INTEREST ADJUSTMENT.  (a)  Each fiscal year and subject to Subsection (b), the retirement system shall compute the gain sharing interest rate by:
    
    (1)  determining the average return on the investment of the system's cash and securities during the preceding five fiscal years, expressed as a percentage rate;
    
    (2)  subtracting four percentage points from the percentage rate determined under Subdivision (1); and
    
    (3)  multiplying the resulting difference under Subdivision (2) by 50 percent.
    
    (b)  Subject to Subsection (c), each fiscal year, the retirement system shall:
    
    (1)  in addition to the amount deposited under Section [820.102](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=820.102), deposit into each member's individual account in the employees saving account an amount equal to the gain sharing interest rate determined under Subsection (a) for the fiscal year multiplied by the member's accumulated account balance as of the end of the preceding fiscal year; and
    
    (2)  recalculate the annuity payment of a retiree or annuitant under this chapter by:
    
    (A)  multiplying the annuity payment amount as of the end of the preceding fiscal year by the gain sharing interest rate determined under Subsection (a); or
    
    (B)  if the retiree or annuitant was not entitled to an annuity payment as of the end of the preceding fiscal year, multiplying the retiree's or annuitant's first annuity payment amount by the gain sharing interest rate determined under Subsection (a).
    
    (c)  The gain sharing interest rate applied under Subsection (b) may not be less than zero or more than three percent.
    
    (d)  Subsection (b) applies only to a retiree or annuitant who is receiving a cash balance annuity under Section [820.053](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=820.053) or [820.0535](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=820.0535), including an alternate payee under Section [804.005](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=804.005).
