    (1)  conducting a survey of the wages received by classes of workers employed on projects of a character similar to the contract work in the political subdivision of the state in which the public work is to be performed;  or

    (b)  This subsection applies only to a public work located in a county bordering the United Mexican States or in a county adjacent to a county bordering the United Mexican States.  For a contract for a public work awarded by the state, the public body shall determine the general prevailing rate of per diem wages in the locality in which the public work is to be performed for each craft or type of worker needed to execute the contract and the prevailing rate for legal holiday and overtime work as follows.  The public body shall conduct a survey of the wages received by classes of workers employed on projects of a character similar to the contract work both statewide and in the political subdivision of the state in which the public work is to be performed.

    (c)  The public body shall determine the general prevailing rate of per diem wages as a sum certain, expressed in dollars and cents.
    
    (d)  A public body shall specify in the call for bids for the contract and in the contract itself the wage rates determined under this section.
