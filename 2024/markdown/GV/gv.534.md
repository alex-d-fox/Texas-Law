    Text of section effective until April 01, 2025
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 534.202.  DETERMINATION TO TRANSITION ICF-IID PROGRAM RECIPIENTS AND CERTAIN OTHER MEDICAID WAIVER PROGRAM RECIPIENTS TO MANAGED CARE PROGRAM.  (a)  This section applies to individuals with an intellectual or developmental disability who are receiving long-term services and supports under:
    
    (1)  a Medicaid waiver program; or
    
    (2)  an ICF-IID program.
    
    (b)  Subject to Subsection (g), after implementing the pilot program under Subchapter C and completing the evaluation under Section [534.112](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=534.112), the commission, in consultation and collaboration with the advisory committee, shall develop a plan for the transition of all or a portion of the services provided through an ICF-IID program or a Medicaid waiver program to a Medicaid managed care model.  The plan must include:
    
    (1)  a process for transitioning the services in phases as follows:
    
    (A)  beginning September 1, 2027, the Texas home living (TxHmL) waiver program services;
    
    (B)  beginning September 1, 2029, the community living assistance and support services (CLASS) waiver program services;
    
    (C)  beginning September 1, 2031, nonresidential services provided under the home and community-based services (HCS) waiver program and the deaf-blind with multiple disabilities (DBMD) waiver program; and
    
    (D)  subject to Subdivision (2), the residential services provided under an ICF-IID program, the home and community-based services (HCS) waiver program, and the deaf-blind with multiple disabilities (DBMD) waiver program; and
    
    (2)  a process for evaluating and determining the feasibility and cost efficiency of transitioning residential services described by Subdivision (1)(D) to a Medicaid managed care model that is based on an evaluation of a separate pilot program conducted by the commission, in consultation and collaboration with the advisory committee, that operates after the transition process described by Subdivision (1).
    
    (c)  Before implementing the transition described by Subsection (b), the commission shall, subject to Subsection (g), determine whether to:
    
    (1)  continue operation of the Medicaid waiver programs or ICF-IID program only for purposes of providing, if applicable:
    
    (A)  supplemental long-term services and supports not available under the managed care program delivery model selected by the commission; or
    
    (B)  long-term services and supports to Medicaid waiver program recipients who choose to continue receiving benefits under the waiver programs as provided by Subsection (g); or
    
    (2)  provide all or a portion of the long-term services and supports previously available under the Medicaid waiver programs or ICF-IID program through the managed care program delivery model selected by the commission.
    
    (d)  In implementing the transition described by Subsection (b), the commission shall develop a process to receive and evaluate input from interested statewide stakeholders that is in addition to the input provided by the advisory committee.
    
    (e)  The commission shall ensure that there is a comprehensive plan for transitioning the provision of Medicaid benefits under this section that protects the continuity of care provided to individuals to whom this section applies and ensures individuals have a choice among acute care and comprehensive long-term services and supports providers and service delivery options, including the consumer direction model.
    
    (f)  Before transitioning the provision of Medicaid benefits for children under this section, a managed care organization providing services under the managed care program delivery model selected by the commission must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the commission that the organization's network of providers has experience and expertise in the provision of services to children with an intellectual or developmental disability.  Before transitioning the provision of Medicaid benefits for adults with an intellectual or developmental disability under this section, a managed care organization providing services under the managed care program delivery model selected by the commission must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the commission that the organization's network of providers has experience and expertise in the provision of services to adults with an intellectual or developmental disability.
    
    (g)  If the commission determines that all or a portion of the long-term services and supports previously available under the Medicaid waiver programs should be provided through a managed care program delivery model under Subsection (c)(2), the commission shall, at the time of the transition, allow each recipient receiving long-term services and supports under a Medicaid waiver program the option of:
    
    (1)  continuing to receive the services and supports under the Medicaid waiver program; or
    
    (2)  receiving the services and supports through the managed care program delivery model selected by the commission.
    
    (h)  A recipient who chooses to receive long-term services and supports through a managed care program delivery model under Subsection (g) may not, at a later time, choose to receive the services and supports under a Medicaid waiver program.
    
    (i)  In addition to the requirements of Section [533.005](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=533.005), a contract between a managed care organization and the commission for the organization to provide Medicaid benefits under this section must contain a requirement that the organization implement a process for individuals with an intellectual or developmental disability that:
    
    (1)  ensures that the individuals have a choice among acute care and comprehensive long-term services and supports providers and service delivery options, including the consumer direction model;
    
    (2)  to the greatest extent possible, protects those individuals' continuity of care with respect to access to primary care providers, including the use of single-case agreements with out-of-network providers; and
    
    (3)  provides access to a member services phone line for individuals or their legally authorized representatives to obtain information on and assistance with accessing services through network providers, including providers of primary, specialty, and other long-term services and supports.
