    Sec. 824.1011.  DESIGNATION OF BENEFICIARY AFTER RETIREMENT.  (a)  A retiree who is receiving a standard service or disability retirement annuity under Section [824.203](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=824.203) or [824.304](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=824.304)(b) and who marries after the date of the person's retirement may replace the annuity by selecting an optional retirement annuity under Section [824.204](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=824.204)(c)(1), (c)(2), or (c)(5) or under Section [824.308](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=824.308)(c)(1), (c)(2), or (c)(5), as applicable, and designating the person's spouse as beneficiary before the second anniversary of the marriage in the same manner as an annuity selection and designation of beneficiary may be made before retirement.
    
    (b)  The selection of an optional annuity and designation of a beneficiary under this section do not take effect until the first payment of the annuity that becomes due two years after the date the selection and designation are filed with the retirement system.
    
    (c)  The retirement system shall recompute the annuity of a retiree who selects an optional annuity and designates a beneficiary under this section to reflect that change and shall adjust the annuity as appropriate for early retirement and postretirement increases provided after the date of the retiree's retirement.  The retirement system shall by rule provide for the adjustment of the monthly payments of the annuity under the option selected to an amount which is the actuarial equivalent of the annuity being paid immediately before the change in benefit option and beneficiary selection.
    
    (d)  If a retiree who selects an optional annuity and designates a beneficiary under this section dies before the change takes effect or if the designated beneficiary dies before the change takes effect, the selection of an optional annuity and designation of beneficiary have no effect.

    Sec. 824.1012.  POST-RETIREMENT CHANGE IN RETIREMENT PAYMENT PLAN FOR CERTAIN RETIREMENT BENEFIT OPTIONS.  (a)  As an exception to Section [824.101](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=824.101)(c), a retiree who selected an optional service retirement annuity under Section [824.204](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=824.204)(c)(1), (c)(2), or (c)(5) or an optional disability retirement annuity under Section [824.308](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=824.308)(c)(1), (c)(2), or (c)(5) and who has received at least one payment under the plan selected may change the optional annuity selection made by the retiree to a standard service or disability retirement annuity as provided for in this section.  If the beneficiary of the optional annuity was the spouse of the retiree when the retiree designated the spouse as beneficiary of the optional annuity, to change from the optional annuity to a standard retirement annuity under this subsection, the spouse or former spouse, as applicable, who was designated the beneficiary of the optional annuity must sign a notarized consent to the change or a court with jurisdiction over the marriage of the retiree and beneficiary must approve or order the change.  The change in plan selection takes effect when the retirement system receives the request to change the plan, provided the signed consent form or court order, as applicable, is subsequently received by the retirement system.
    
    (a-1)  The executive director or the executive director's designee has exclusive authority to determine whether the language in a court order described by Subsection (a) is sufficient to indicate that the court has approved or ordered the change in plan selection.  A determination by the executive director or the executive director's designee under this subsection may be appealed only to the board of trustees, except that the board by rule may waive the requirement that an appeal be to the board.  An appeal to the board is a contested case under Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001).  The standard of review of an appeal brought under this subsection is by substantial evidence.
    
    (b)  A change described by Subsection (a) cancels the optional annuity selection made by the retiree, effective with the beginning of payments of the annuity as recomputed under this subsection.  The retiree is entitled to receive payments of a standard service or disability retirement annuity, as applicable, reduced for early retirement, if applicable, beginning with the payment for the month after the month in which the retirement system receives the notice of change and ending on the death of the retiree.   The change also cancels the designation of beneficiary with respect to the optional annuity benefit but does not cancel a designation with respect to any other benefit payable by the retirement system on the death of the retiree.
    
    (c)  The retirement system by rule may establish requirements for forms, documentation, and procedures necessary for the administration of this section.

    (b)  If the beneficiary designated at the time of the retiree's retirement is the spouse of the retiree at the time of the designation:
    
    (1)  the spouse must give written, notarized consent to the change;
    
    (2)  if the parties divorce after the designation, the former spouse who was designated beneficiary must give written, notarized consent to the change; or

    (2)  the remainder of the new beneficiary's life.
    
    (c-1)  Notwithstanding Subsection (c), a beneficiary designated under this section is entitled on the retiree's death to receive monthly payments of the survivor's portion of the retiree's optional retirement annuity for the remainder of the beneficiary's life if the beneficiary designated at the time of the retiree's retirement is a trust and the beneficiary designated under this section is:
    
    (1)  the sole beneficiary of that trust; or
    
    (2)  an individual who at the time of the retiree's death is the sole beneficiary of that trust.
    
    (c-2)  The executive director or the executive director's designee has exclusive authority to determine whether the language in a court order described by Subsection (b) is sufficient to indicate that the court has approved or ordered the change in the designated beneficiary.  A determination by the executive director or the executive director's designee under this subsection may be appealed only to the board of trustees, except that the board by rule may waive the requirement that an appeal be to the board.  An appeal to the board is a contested case under Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001).  The standard of review of an appeal brought under this subsection is by substantial evidence.
    
    (d)  A retiree may not change a beneficiary under this section after retirement if the retiree has previously changed or designated after retirement a beneficiary for optional retirement annuity payments under this subtitle.

    Sec. 824.204.  OPTIONAL SERVICE RETIREMENT BENEFITS.  (a)  Instead of the standard service retirement annuity payable under Section [824.203](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=824.203) or an annuity reduced because of age under Section [824.202](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=824.202), a retiring member may elect to receive an optional service retirement annuity, reduced for early retirement if applicable, under this section.  An election to receive an optional service retirement annuity must be filed with the board of trustees not later than the effective date of retirement.
    
    (b)  An optional service retirement annuity is an annuity payable throughout the life of the retiree and is actuarially reduced from the annuity otherwise payable under this subtitle to its actuarial equivalent under the option selected under Subsection (c).
    
    (c)  An eligible member may select one of the following options, which provide that:
    
    (1)  after the retiree's death, the reduced annuity is payable to and throughout the life of the person nominated by the retiree's written designation filed prior to retirement;
    
    (2)  after the retiree's death, one-half of the reduced annuity is payable to and throughout the life of the person nominated by the retiree's written designation filed prior to retirement;
    
    (3)  if the retiree dies before 60 monthly annuity payments have been made, the remainder of the 60 payments are payable to the designated beneficiary;  
    
    (4)  if the retiree dies before 120 monthly annuity payments have been made, the remainder of the 120 payments are payable to the designated beneficiary;  or
    
    (5)  after the retiree's death, three-fourths of the reduced annuity is payable to and throughout the life of the person nominated by the retiree's written designation filed prior to retirement.
    
    (d)  If a person who is nominated by a retiree in the written designation under Section [824.101](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=824.101) predeceases the retiree, the reduced annuity of a retiree who has elected an optional service retirement annuity under Subsection (c)(1), (c)(2), or (c)(5) shall be increased to the standard service retirement annuity that the retiree would otherwise be entitled to receive if the retiree had not selected that annuity option.  The standard service retirement annuity shall be adjusted as appropriate for:
    
    (1)  early retirement as provided by Section [824.202](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=824.202);  and
    
    (2)  postretirement increases in retirement benefits authorized by law after the date of retirement.
    
    (e)  The increase in the annuity under Subsection (d) begins with the payment due at the end of September, 1995, or the first monthly payment made to the retiree following the date of death of the person nominated, whichever is later, and is payable to the retiree for the remainder of the retiree's life.
    
    (f)  The board of trustees shall adopt separate tables to be used to reduce an optional service retirement annuity under Subsection (d) to the actuarial equivalent of the standard service retirement annuity.

(a)  A member may select a standard service retirement annuity or an optional service retirement annuity described by Section [824.204](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=824.204), reduced for early age as applicable under Section [824.202](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=824.202), together with a partial lump-sum distribution, if:
    
    (1)  the member is eligible for a service retirement annuity;
    
    (2)  the sum of the member's age and amount of service credit in the retirement system equals the number 90; and
    
    (3)  the member is not participating in the deferred retirement option plan under Subchapter I.
    
    (b)  The amount of the lump-sum distribution under this section may not exceed the sum of 36 months of a standard service retirement annuity reduced for early age as applicable under Section [824.202](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=824.202) computed without regard to this section.
    
    (c)  The service retirement annuity selected by the member shall be actuarially reduced to reflect the lump-sum option selected by the member and shall be actuarially equivalent to a standard or optional service retirement annuity, as applicable, reduced for early age as applicable under Section [824.202](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=824.202), without the partial lump-sum distribution.  The annuity and lump sum shall be computed to result in no actuarial loss to the retirement system.
    
    (d)  The retiring member may choose a lump sum equal to 12 months of a standard service retirement annuity and payable at the same time that the first monthly payment of the annuity is paid, a lump sum equal to 24 months of a standard annuity and payable in one or two annual payments, or a lump sum equal to 36 months of a standard annuity and payable in one, two, or three annual payments.  At the option of the member, a payment under this subsection may be made as provided by Section [825.509](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=825.509).  The amount of the lump sum shall be computed based on a standard service retirement annuity reduced for early age as applicable under Section [824.202](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=824.202).
    
    (e)  The amount of the lump-sum distribution will be deducted from any amounts otherwise payable under Section [824.503](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=824.503).
    
    (f)  The partial lump-sum option under this section may be elected only once by a member and may not be elected by a retiree.  A member retiring under the proportionate retirement program under Chapter [803](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=803) is not eligible for the partial lump-sum option.
    
    (g)  Before a retiring member selects a partial lump-sum distribution under this section, the retirement system shall provide a written notice to the member of the amount by which the member's annuity will be reduced because of the selection.  The member shall be asked to sign a copy of or receipt for the notice, and the retirement system shall maintain the signed copy or receipt.
    
    (h)  The board of trustees may adopt rules for the implementation of this section.

(a)  Instead of an annuity payable under Section [824.304](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=824.304)(b), a member retiring under that section may elect to receive an optional disability retirement annuity under this section.  An election to receive an optional disability retirement annuity must be filed with the board of trustees not later than the later of the effective date of retirement or the date the member applies for retirement.
    
    (b)  An optional disability retirement annuity is an annuity payable throughout the disability of the disability retiree and is actuarially reduced from the annuity otherwise payable under Section [824.304](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=824.304)(b), after any reduction under rules adopted under Section [824.310](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=824.310),  to its actuarial equivalent under the option selected under Subsection (c).
    
    (c)  An eligible member may select one of the following options:
    
    (1)  after the disability retiree's death, the reduced annuity is payable throughout the life of a person nominated by the retiree's written designation under Section [824.101](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=824.101) filed before retirement;
    
    (2)  after the disability retiree's death, one-half of the reduced annuity is payable throughout the life of the retiree's designated beneficiary;
    
    (3)  if the disability retiree dies before 60 monthly annuity payments have been made, the remainder of the 60 payments are payable to the designated beneficiary;
    
    (4)  if the disability retiree dies before 120 monthly annuity payments have been made, the remainder of the 120 payments are payable to the designated beneficiary;  or
    
    (5)  after the disability retiree's death, three-fourths of the reduced annuity is payable throughout the life of the retiree's designated beneficiary.
    
    (d)  If the person nominated by the disability retiree's written designation under Section [824.101](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=824.101) filed before or at the time of retirement predeceases the disability retiree, the reduced annuity of a disability retiree who has elected an optional retirement annuity under Subsection (c)(1), (c)(2), or (c)(5) is increased to the standard retirement annuity that the disability retiree would otherwise be entitled to receive if the disability retiree had not selected an annuity option.  The standard retirement annuity shall be adjusted as appropriate for postretirement increases in retirement benefits authorized by law after the date of retirement.
    
    (e)  The increase in the annuity under Subsection (d) begins with the first monthly payment made to the disability retiree after the date of death of the designated beneficiary and is payable to the disability retiree for the remainder of the disability retiree's disability.
    
    (f)  The board of trustees shall adopt separate tables to be used to reduce an optional disability retirement annuity under this section to the actuarial equivalent of the standard retirement annuity.
    
    (g)  The continued payment to a disability retiree and the future payment to the retiree's designated beneficiary of any disability benefit, including an optional payment elected under Subsection (c), are conditioned on the continuation of the retiree's disabled status until the date of the retiree's death.
    
    (h)  The same requirements and limitations that apply to the designation or changing of beneficiaries for service retirement annuity options, including Section [824.101](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=824.101), apply to the designation of beneficiaries for disability retirement options.

    (4)  in a position, other than as a substitute, on no more than a one-half time basis for no more than 90 days in the school year, if the retiree is a disability retiree; or
    
    (5)  as a tutor under Section [33.913](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=33.913), Education Code.

    (d)  Repealed by Acts 2011, 82nd Leg., R.S., Ch. 928, Sec. 5, eff. June 17, 2011.
    
    (e)  Except as provided by Subsections (n) and (o), the exception provided by Subsection (a) does not apply to a retiree working as a substitute under Subsection (a)(1) who also works in another position described by Subsection (a) in the same month.
    
    (f)  The retirement system shall include any employment during the school year, including any employment that relied on the exemption provided by Subsection (a)(1) or (a)(4), in determining whether and when a disability retiree has exceeded 90 days of employment in the school year.
    
    (g)  The exceptions provided by Subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3) do not apply to disability retirees.  The retirement system nevertheless may not withhold a monthly benefit payment under Section [824.601](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=824.601) if:
    
    (1)  a disability retiree is employed in a Texas public educational institution in a position, other than as a substitute, for a period not to exceed three consecutive months;
    
    (2)  the work occurs in a period, designated by the disability retiree, of no more than three consecutive months;
    
    (3)  the disability retiree executes on a form and at a time prescribed by the retirement system a written election to have this exception apply on a one-time trial basis in determining whether benefits are to be suspended for the months of employment after retirement and in determining whether a disability retiree is no longer mentally or physically incapacitated for the performance of duty; and
    
    (4)  the disability retiree has not previously elected to avoid loss of monthly benefits under this subsection.
    
    (h)  A disability retiree is not entitled to service credit for service during a trial period under Subsection (g) if the retiree is restored to active service.

    (j)  The board of trustees shall adopt rules governing the employment of a substitute and defining "one-half time basis."
    
    (k)  The actuary designated by the board of trustees shall, in investigating the experience of the members of the system, note any significant increase in early age retirements and determine the extent to which any increase has been caused by the exception to loss of benefits for employment after retirement provided by Subsection (a)(3).  If the actuary certifies in writing to the retirement system that sound actuarial funding of the retirement system's benefits is endangered by continuation of this exception, the board of trustees may determine that no further elections of the exception will be accepted from retirees, other than from those who have previously relied on the exception in retiring under this subtitle.  A retiree may be considered to have relied on this exception only if retirement occurred on or after May 31, 1985, but before the date the board of trustees acknowledges receipt of such certification and if the retiree has first elected to receive benefits under the exception not later than two years after the retiree's effective date of retirement.

    Sec. 824.701.  APPLICATION OF ANNUITY INCREASES TO CERTAIN ANNUITIES.  (a)  An increase that is provided by law in the amount of an annuity being paid by the retirement system and that is applicable to retirements occurring before, or not later than, a date specified in the law also applies to an annuity based on the service of a member who, before October 1, 1989:
    
    (1)  accepted, under Subchapter C, service retirement that became effective on a date that is within the period specified for eligibility for the increase;
    
    (2)  subsequently revoked the person's service retirement as provided by Section [824.005](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=824.005);

    (5)  subsequently accepted service retirement that became effective at the end of the month in which the earlier revocation of service retirement occurred;  and
    
    (6)  applies to the retirement system in writing for recomputation of the person's annuity.
    
    (b)  As soon as practicable after a person applies under this section, the retirement system shall verify whether an applicant meets the requirements of this section and is entitled to any increases in annuities provided by existing law.
    
    (c)  The retirement system shall increase the amount of an annuity payable to a retiree who applies and is verified as eligible for an increase in annuities provided by law, by the amount or rate of the increase.  The first payment of an annuity as increased by this section is due on the later of:
    
    (1)  the end of the month in which the retiree is verified under this section as eligible for the increase;  or
    
    (2)  a date of first payment specified in the law providing for the increase.
    
    (d)  For the sole purpose of determining eligibility for or the amount of increases in annuities provided by law after the date a retiree has been verified as eligible for an increase under this section, the date of retirement of the person on whose service the annuity is based will be considered the date of original service retirement that was subsequently revoked, if the retiree has not terminated the subsequent service retirement as provided by this subtitle.

    Sec. 824.802.  PARTICIPATION IN PLAN.  (a)  A contributing member who is eligible under Section [824.202](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=824.202) to retire and receive a standard service retirement annuity that is not reduced for retirement at an early age and who has at least 25 years of service credit in the retirement system may, if the member remains an employee, elect to participate in the deferred retirement option plan.
    
    (b)  An election to participate in the plan must be on a form prescribed by and filed with the retirement system.  An election may be made only once and must state the period that the member wishes to participate in the plan.  The period must be a minimum of 12 consecutive months and be in 12-month increments.  The maximum period a member may participate in the plan is 60 consecutive months.  An election under this section is irrevocable after filing.  The filing of an election under this section is not considered for any purpose an application for retirement, and a person is not considered a retiree for any purpose because of the filing.
    
    (c)  The effective date of a member's participation in the plan is the first day of the month after the month in which an election is received and approved by the retirement system.  The retirement system shall approve the election filed by a member who is eligible to make the election.

    Sec. 824.803.  COMPUTATION OF PARTICIPANT'S SERVICE AND ANNUITY.  (a)  A person participating in the plan remains a member of the retirement system during the period of participation, unless the member terminates membership under Section [822.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=822.003), but the member may not, during participation, accrue additional service credit.  The member shall make employee contributions to the retirement system, and the state and the member's employing district, if applicable, shall make contributions for the member's service performed during the member's participation in the plan.  Member contributions made during the period of participation in the plan are not eligible for withdrawal by the participant and are deposited in the retired reserve account.  The member and the state retain the obligation to contribute under Sections [1575.202](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1575.202) and [1575.203](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1575.203), Insurance Code, during the member's participation in this plan.

A participating member is not eligible to receive a postretirement increase made applicable to annuitants during the member's participation in the plan.
    
    (c)  An election to participate in the plan constitutes a deadline for the purchase of special service credit.

    (c)  If a member dies during participation in the plan or after participation but before retirement, the decedent's designated beneficiary is entitled to the accumulated amount in the decedent's account in the deferred retirement option account, including creditable interest.  The beneficiary is also entitled to a death benefit based on compensation and years of service on the effective date of participation in the plan and on age on the date of death.
    
    (d)  Payment of the benefit provided under the plan is in addition to any annuity otherwise payable under this subtitle.
