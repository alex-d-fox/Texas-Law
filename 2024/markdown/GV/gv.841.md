    (1)  to the spouse of the person, as trustee for the person;

    (1)  a trust described by Subchapter B, Chapter [1301](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ES&Value=1301), Estates Code, that has been created for the management of guardianship funds for the benefit of the person; or

    (c-1)  If the director reasonably believes that the individual or entity accepting benefits for the person has breached a fiduciary duty owed to the person or is failing to act in the interest of or for the benefit of the person and the person may suffer personal or financial harm as a result, the retirement system, on giving notice to the individual or entity receiving payments on behalf of the person, may cease making payments to the individual or entity.  Thereafter, the system may make payment of any annuity or other benefit in a manner provided by Subsection (b).  This subsection does not apply if a court of competent jurisdiction has appointed the individual or entity accepting benefits for the person.

    (b)  Following a division described by Subsection (a), the portion of the accrued benefit awarded the alternate payee is considered the alternate payee's sole and separate property in which the member has no interest.  The board of trustees by rule shall define and specify the rights and responsibilities of the alternate payee and the terms and features of the benefit awarded the alternate payee under the order, but in no event may the alternate payee vest in the accrued benefit before the member vests or attain greater rights than are attained by the member or the member's beneficiary.
    
    (c)  Notwithstanding Section [804.101](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=804.101), the board of trustees by rule may prescribe terms on which the interest awarded the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order described by this section may be transferred at the alternate payee's death.
    
    (d)  The board of trustees has sole authority and discretion to:
    
    (1)  specify the terms and format that are required for a qualified domestic relations order to be acceptable for purposes of Subsection (a);

    (3)  specify the dates on which a distribution to an alternate payee may or must begin; and

The actuarial equivalent value of the accrued benefit payable to an alternate payee may not be greater than the actuarial equivalent value of the accrued benefit as if there had been no division and the accrued benefit had been payable to the member in the form of an annuity.
