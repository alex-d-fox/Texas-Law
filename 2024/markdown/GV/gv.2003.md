    Sec. 2003.024.  INTERAGENCY CONTRACTS; ANTICIPATED HOURLY USAGE AND COST ESTIMATES.  (a)  If a state agency referred matters to the office during any of the three most recent state fiscal years for which complete information about the agency's hourly usage is available and the costs to the office of conducting hearings and alternative dispute resolution procedures for the state agency are not to be paid by appropriations to the office during a state fiscal biennium, the office and the agency shall enter into an interagency contract for the biennium under which the referring agency pays the office either a lump-sum amount at the start of each fiscal year of the biennium or a fixed amount at the start of each fiscal quarter of the biennium for all services provided to the agency during the fiscal year. The office shall report to the Legislative Budget Board any agency that fails to make a timely payment under the contract. The lump-sum or quarterly amount paid to the office under the contract must be based on:
    
    (1)  an hourly rate that is set by the office:
    
    (A)  in an amount that sufficiently covers the office's full costs in providing services to the agency, including costs for items listed in Subsection (c)(2); and

The office shall estimate an agency's anticipated hourly usage by evaluating:
    
    (1)  the number of hours spent by the office conducting hearings or alternative dispute resolution procedures for the state agency during the three most recent state fiscal years for which complete information about the agency's hourly usage is available;  and
    
    (2)  any other relevant information, including information provided to the office by the state agency, that suggests an anticipated increase or decrease in the agency's hourly usage of the office's services during the state fiscal biennium, as compared to past usage.
    
    (a-2)  The office, for a contract entered into as provided by Subsection (a) under which a quarterly amount is paid by the referring agency to the office, shall:
    
    (1)  track the agency's actual hourly usage of the office's services during each fiscal quarter; and
    
    (2)  forecast, after each fiscal quarter, the agency's anticipated hourly usage for the rest of the fiscal year.
    
    (a-3)  If a state agency did not refer matters to the office during any of the three state fiscal years preceding a state fiscal biennium for which complete information about the agency's hourly usage would have been available and did not provide information to the office sufficient for the office to reasonably and timely estimate anticipated usage and enter into a contract with the agency before the start of the state fiscal biennium, and the costs to the office of conducting hearings and alternative dispute resolution procedures for the state agency are not paid by appropriations to the office for the state fiscal biennium, the referring agency shall pay the office the costs of conducting hearings or procedures for the agency based on the hourly rate that is set by the office under Subsection (a) and on the agency's actual usage of the office's services.
    
    (b)  If the costs to the office of conducting hearings and alternative dispute resolution procedures for a state agency that refers matters to the office are anticipated to be paid by a lump-sum appropriation to the office for a state fiscal biennium, the office shall timely provide to the legislature the information described by Subsection (c).
    
    (c)  Each state fiscal biennium, the office as part of its legislative appropriation request shall file:
    
    (1)  information, as estimated under Subsection (a-1), related to the anticipated hourly usage of each state agency that refers matters to the office for which the costs of hearings and alternative dispute resolution procedures are anticipated to be paid by appropriations to the office; and
    
    (2)  an estimate of its hourly costs in conducting each type of hearing or dispute resolution procedure based on the average cost per hour during the preceding state fiscal year of:
    
    (A)  the salaries of its administrative law judges;
    
    (B)  the travel expenses, hearing costs, and telephone charges directly related to the conduct of a hearing or procedure; and
    
    (C)  the administrative costs of the office, including docketing costs.
    
    (d)  This section does not apply to hearings conducted under the administrative license revocation program.

    (1)  the draft permit meets all state and federal legal and technical requirements; and
    
    (2)  a permit, if issued consistent with the draft permit, would protect human health and safety, the environment, and physical property.
    
    (i-2)  A party may rebut a demonstration under Subsection (i-1) by presenting evidence that:
    
    (1)  relates to a matter referred under Section [5.557](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=5.557), Water Code, or an issue included in a list submitted under Subsection (e) in connection with a matter referred under Section [5.556](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=5.556), Water Code; and
    
    (2)  demonstrates that one or more provisions in the draft permit violate a specifically applicable state or federal requirement.
    
    (i-3)  If in accordance with Subsection (i-2) a party rebuts a presumption established under Subsection (i-1), the applicant and the executive director may present additional evidence to support the draft permit.

    (1)  disallowing further discovery of any kind or of a particular kind by the offending party;
    
    (2)  charging all or any part of the expenses of discovery against the offending party or its representatives;

The administrative law judge shall make a proposal for decision to the commission and shall serve the proposal for decision on all parties.  An opportunity shall be given to each party to file exceptions to the proposal for decision and briefs related to the issues addressed in the proposal for decision.  The commission shall consider and act on the proposal for decision.
    
    (m)  Except as provided in Section [361.0832](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=361.0832), Health and Safety Code, the commission shall consider the proposal for decision prepared by the administrative law judge, the exceptions of the parties, and the briefs and argument of the parties.  The commission may amend the proposal for decision, including any finding of fact, but any such amendment thereto and order shall be based solely on the record made before the administrative law judge.  Any such amendment by the commission shall be accompanied by an explanation of the basis of the amendment.  The commission may also refer the matter back to the administrative law judge to reconsider any findings and conclusions set forth in the proposal for decision or take additional evidence or to make additional findings of fact or conclusions of law.  The commission shall serve a copy of the commission's order, including its finding of facts and conclusions of law, on each party.
    
    (n)  The provisions of Chapter [2001](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001) shall apply to contested case hearings for the commission to the extent not inconsistent with this section.
    
    (o)  An administrative law judge hearing a case on behalf of the commission may not, without the agreement of all parties, issue an order referring the case to an alternative dispute resolution procedure if the commission has already conducted an unsuccessful alternative dispute resolution procedure.  If the commission has not already conducted an alternative dispute resolution procedure, the administrative law judge shall consider the commission's recommendation in determining whether to issue an order referring the case to the procedure.
