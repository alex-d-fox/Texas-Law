    Sec. 325.003.  SUNSET ADVISORY COMMISSION.  (a)  The Sunset Advisory Commission is a legislative agency that consists of five members of the senate and one public member appointed by the lieutenant governor and five members of the house of representatives and one public member appointed by the speaker of the house.  The lieutenant governor and the speaker of the house may serve as one of the legislative appointees.
    
    (a-1)  A public member acts on behalf of the legislature when participating on the commission in furtherance of the legislature's duty to provide oversight of executive branch agencies' implementation of legislative priorities.
    
    (b)  An individual is not eligible for appointment as a public member if the individual or the individual's spouse is:
    
    (1)  regulated by a state agency that the commission will review during the term for which the individual would serve;
    
    (2)  employed by, participates in the management of, or directly or indirectly has more than a 10 percent interest in a business entity or other organization regulated by a state agency the commission will review during the term for which the individual would serve; or
    
    (3)  required to register as a lobbyist under Chapter [305](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=305) because of the person's activities for compensation on behalf of a profession or entity related to the operation of an agency under review.
    
    (c)  It is a ground for removal of a public member from the commission if the member does not have the qualifications required by Subsection (b) for appointment to the commission at the time of appointment or does not maintain the qualifications while serving on the commission.  The validity of the commission's action is not affected by the fact that it was taken when a ground for removal of a public member from the commission existed.
    
    (d)  Legislative members serve four-year terms, with terms staggered so that the terms of as near to one-half of the legislative members appointed by the lieutenant governor as possible and the terms of as near to one-half of the legislative members appointed by the speaker as possible expire September 1 of each odd-numbered year.  If the lieutenant governor or the speaker serves on the commission, service continues until resignation from the commission or until the individual ceases to hold the office.  Public members serve two-year terms expiring September 1 of each odd-numbered year.
    
    (e)  Members other than the lieutenant governor and the speaker are subject to the following restrictions:
    
    (1)  after a legislative member serves two terms on the commission or a public member serves three terms on the commission, the individual is not eligible for appointment to another term or part of a term;
    
    (2)  a legislative member who serves a full term may not be appointed to an immediately succeeding term; and
    
    (3)  a public member may not serve more than two consecutive terms, and, for purposes of this prohibition, a member is considered to have served a term only if the member has served more than half of the term.
    
    (e-1)  If an individual serves for less than a full term, the term is not counted toward determining the individual's eligibility to serve on the commission under Subsection (e)(1) unless the individual was a member of the commission for each public hearing at which the state agencies being reviewed during the individual's term were discussed.
    
    (f)  The lieutenant governor and speaker shall make their appointments before September 1 of each odd-numbered year.
    
    (g)  If a legislative member ceases to be a member of the house from which he was appointed, the member vacates his membership on the commission.
    
    (h)  If a vacancy occurs, the appropriate appointing authority shall appoint a person to serve for the remainder of the unexpired term in the same manner as the original appointment.
    
    (i)  The commission shall have a chairman and vice-chairman as presiding officers.  The chairmanship and vice-chairmanship must alternate every two years between the two membership groups appointed by the lieutenant governor and the speaker.  The chairman and vice-chairman may not be from the same membership group.  The lieutenant governor shall designate a presiding officer from his appointed membership group and the speaker shall designate the other presiding officer from his appointed membership group.
    
    (j)  Seven members of the commission constitute a quorum.  A final action or recommendation may not be made unless approved by a record vote of a majority of members appointed by the lieutenant governor and the speaker of the house.  All other actions by the commission shall be decided by a majority of the members present and voting.
    
    (k)  Each member of the commission is entitled to reimbursement for actual and necessary expenses incurred in performing commission duties.  Each legislative member is entitled to reimbursement from the appropriate fund of the member's respective house.  Each public member is entitled to reimbursement from funds appropriated to the commission.

    Sec. 325.0115.  CRITERIA FOR REVIEW OF CERTAIN AGENCIES.  (a) In this section:
    
    (1)  "License" means a license, certificate, registration, permit, or other form of authorization required by law or a state agency rule that must be obtained by an individual to engage in a particular occupation or profession.
    
    (2)  "Public interest" means protection from a present and recognizable harm to public health, safety, or welfare.  The term does not include speculative threats, or other non-demonstrable menaces to public health, safety, or welfare.  For the purposes of this subdivision, the term "welfare" includes the financial health of the public when the absence of governmental regulation unreasonably increases risk and liability to broad classes of consumers.
    
    (b)  In an assessment of an agency that licenses an occupation or profession, the commission and its staff shall consider:
    
    (1)  whether the occupational licensing program:
    
    (A)  serves a meaningful, defined public interest; and
    
    (B)  provides the least restrictive form of regulation that will adequately protect the public interest;
    
    (2)  the extent to which the regulatory objective of the occupational licensing program may be achieved through market forces, private or industry certification and accreditation programs, or enforcement of other law;
    
    (3)  the extent to which licensing criteria, if applicable, ensure that applicants have occupational skill sets or competencies that correlate with a public interest and the impact that those criteria have on applicants, particularly those with moderate or low incomes, seeking to enter the occupation or profession; and
    
    (4)  the impact of the regulation, including the extent to which the program stimulates or restricts competition and affects consumer choice and the cost of services.
    
    (c)  As part of the commission's review of an agency that licenses an occupation or profession, the commission and its staff shall determine whether the governing body of the agency being reviewed has made an evaluation regarding the type of personal information of license holders that the agency should make available on the agency's Internet website based on the following factors:
    
    (1)  the type of information the public needs to file a complaint with the agency;
    
    (2)  the type of information the public needs to locate an existing or potential service provider;
    
    (3)  the type of information the public needs to verify a license; and
    
    (4)  whether making the information available on the agency's Internet website could subject a license holder to harassment, solicitation, or other nuisance. 
    
    (d)  If the commission determines that the governing body of an agency has not completed the evaluation described by Subsection (c), the commission shall make a recommendation that the governing body of the agency perform such an evaluation.

    (2)  make recommendations on the consolidation, transfer, or reorganization of programs within state agencies not under review when the programs duplicate functions performed in agencies under review;

    Sec. 325.017.  PROCEDURE AFTER TERMINATION.  (a)  A state agency that is abolished in an odd-numbered year may continue in existence until September 1 of the following year to conclude its business.  Unless the law provides otherwise, abolishment does not reduce or otherwise limit the powers and authority of the state agency during the concluding year.  A state agency is terminated and shall cease all activities at the expiration of the one-year period.  Unless the law provides otherwise, all rules that have been adopted by the state agency expire at the expiration of the one-year period.
    
    (b)  Any unobligated and unexpended appropriations of an abolished agency or advisory committee lapse on September 1 of the even-numbered year after abolishment.
    
    (c)  Except as provided by Subsection (f) or as otherwise provided by law, all money in a dedicated fund of an abolished state agency or advisory committee on September 1 of the even-numbered year after abolishment is transferred to the General Revenue Fund.  The part of the law dedicating the money to a specific fund of an abolished agency becomes void on September 1 of the even-numbered year after abolishment.
    
    (d)  Unless the law or a rider in the General Appropriations Act provides otherwise, an abolished state agency or advisory committee funded in the General Appropriations Act for both years of the biennium may not spend or obligate any of the money appropriated to it for the second year of the biennium.
    
    (e)  Unless the governor designates an appropriate state agency as prescribed by Subsection (f), property and records in the custody of an abolished state agency or advisory committee on September 1 of the even-numbered year after abolishment shall be transferred to the comptroller.  If the governor designates an appropriate state agency, the property and records shall be transferred to the designated state agency.
    
    (f)  The legislature recognizes the state's continuing obligation to pay bonded indebtedness and all other obligations, including lease, contract, and other written obligations, incurred by a state agency abolished under this chapter, and this chapter does not impair or impede the payment of bonded indebtedness and all other obligations, including lease, contract, and other written obligations, in accordance with their terms.  If an abolished state agency has outstanding bonded indebtedness or other outstanding obligations, including lease, contract, and other written obligations, the bonds and all other obligations, including lease, contract, and other written obligations, remain valid and enforceable in accordance with their terms and subject to all applicable terms and conditions of the laws and proceedings authorizing the bonds and all other obligations, including lease, contract, and other written obligations.  The governor shall designate an appropriate state agency that shall continue to carry out all covenants contained in the bonds and in all other obligations, including lease, contract, and other written obligations, and the proceedings authorizing them, including the issuance of bonds, and the performance of all other obligations, including lease, contract, and other written obligations, to complete the construction of projects or the performance of other obligations, including lease, contract, and other written obligations.  The designated state agency shall provide payment from the sources of payment of the bonds in accordance with the terms of the bonds and shall provide payment from the sources of payment of all other obligations, including lease, contract, and other written obligations, in accordance with their terms, whether from taxes, revenues, or otherwise, until the bonds and interest on the bonds are paid in full and all other obligations, including lease, contract, and other written obligations, are performed and paid in full.  If the proceedings so provide, all funds established by laws or proceedings authorizing the bonds or authorizing other obligations, including lease, contract, and other written obligations, shall remain with the comptroller or the previously designated trustees.  If the proceedings do not provide that the funds remain with the comptroller or the previously designated trustees, the funds shall be transferred to the designated state agency.
    
    (g)  Except as provided by Subsections (a), (e), and (f), all legal interests of a state agency abolished in an odd-numbered year are transferred to the comptroller on the date the state agency is terminated under Subsection (a).
    
    (h)  On the date a state agency that is abolished in an odd-numbered year is terminated under Subsection (a), the governor may designate another state agency to administer any law previously administered by the abolished state agency that remains in effect and a reference in any law to the abolished state agency means the designated state agency.  The governor is not required to designate the same state agency under this subsection that is designated under Subsection (f).

    (b)  In carrying out its functions under this chapter, the commission or its designated staff member may attend any meetings and proceedings of any state agency, including any meeting or proceeding of the governing body of the agency that is closed to the public, and may inspect the records, documents, and files of any state agency, including any record, document, or file that is:
    
    (1)  attorney work product;
    
    (2)  an attorney-client communication; or
    
    (3)  made privileged or confidential by law.
    
    (c)  It is the intent of the legislature to allow the commission and its designated staff members to have access to all meetings or proceedings of a state agency being reviewed by the commission under this chapter and to all records, documents, and files of that agency.  To the extent that this section conflicts with other law that purports to limit the commission's access to meetings or proceedings or to records, documents, and files, this section controls.  If federal law prohibits a state agency from disclosing information in a record, document, or file to the commission, including information in a record, document, or file created as a result of or considered during a meeting or proceeding, the state agency may redact the protected information from the record, document, or file.
    
    (d)  Communications, including conversations, correspondence, and electronic communications, between the commission or its staff and a state agency that relate to a request by the commission for assistance in conducting a review under this chapter are confidential.  A state agency's internal communications related to a request for assistance by the commission are confidential, including any information prepared or maintained by the state agency at the request of the commission or its staff.  With respect to a document, file, or other record prepared or maintained by the state agency that was created in the normal course of the agency's business and not at the request of the commission, the confidentiality created by this subsection applies only to information in the possession of the commission.
