    (B)  comply with water conservation standards published by the state energy conservation office;
    
    (3)  consider the various types of building uses; and
    
    (4)  allow for design flexibility, including allowing for certification under any high-performance design evaluation system approved by the state energy conservation office.
    
    (b-1)  A building to which this section applies must be designed and constructed or renovated so that the building achieves certification under any high-performance design evaluation system approved by the state energy conservation office that:
    
    (1)  is developed and revised through a nationally recognized consensus-based process or by a municipally owned utility in this state;
    
    (2)  provides minimum requirements for energy use, natural resources use, and indoor air quality;
    
    (3)  requires substantiating documentation for certification;
    
    (4)  requires on-site, third-party, post-construction review and verification for certification, or a third-party, post-construction, rigorous review of documentation and verification for certification; and
    
    (5)  encourages the use of materials or products manufactured or produced in this state.
    
    (b-2)  The state energy conservation office shall appoint an advisory committee to advise the office in selecting one or more high-performance building design evaluation systems to approve for use under Subsection (b-1).  At least once every two years, the advisory committee shall review available high-performance building standards and make recommendations to the office.  The advisory committee consists of:
    
    (1)  one individual appointed by the comptroller who represents the state energy conservation office and who serves as the presiding officer of the committee;
    
    (2)  eight individuals with experience and expertise in high-performance buildings or related products, including experience and expertise in energy efficiency, water efficiency, or low-impact site development, with one individual selected from each of the following lists of nominees:

    (b-3)  A contract between a state agency and a private design professional relating to services in connection with the construction or renovation of a building to which this section applies must provide that, for billing purposes, any service provided by the private design professional that is necessary to satisfy the certification requirements of Subsection (b-1) is considered an additional service rather than a basic service.  A governmental entity may not disallow the allocation of federal deductions to eligible design professionals authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Pub. L. No. 109-58).
    
    (c)  Any procedural standard established under this section must be directed toward specific design and building practices that produce good thermal resistance and low infiltration and toward requiring practices in the design of mechanical and electrical systems that maximize energy and water efficiency.  The procedural standards must address, as applicable:
    
    (1)  insulation;
    
    (2)  lighting;

    (11)  metering equipment needed to segregate water use in order to identify water conservation opportunities or verify water savings;
    
    (12)  special energy requirements of health-related facilities of higher education and state agencies;  and
    
    (13)  any other item that the state energy conservation office considers appropriate.
    
    (c-1)  The procedural standards adopted under this section must require that:
    
    (1)  on-site reclaimed system technologies, including rainwater harvesting, condensate collection, or cooling tower blow down, or a combination of those system technologies, for potable and nonpotable indoor and outdoor water use be incorporated into the design and construction of:
    
    (A)  each new state building with a roof area measuring at least 10,000 square feet; and
    
    (B)  any other new state building for which the incorporation of such systems is feasible; and

    (c-2)  The procedural standards required by Subsection (c-1) do not apply to a building if the state agency or institution of higher education constructing the building:
    
    (1)  determines that compliance with those standards is impractical; and
    
    (2)  notifies the state energy conservation office of the determination and provides to the office documentation supporting the determination.
    
    (c-3)  The procedural standards required by Subsection (c-1)(2) apply to a building described by that subdivision unless Subsection (c-2) applies or the state agency or institution of higher education constructing the building provides the state energy conservation office evidence that the amount of rainwater that will be harvested from one or more existing buildings at the same location is equivalent to the amount of rainwater that could have been harvested from the new building had rainwater harvesting system technology been incorporated into its design and construction.
    
    (d)  A state agency or an institution of higher education shall submit a copy of its design and construction manuals to the state energy conservation office as the office considers necessary to demonstrate compliance by the agency or institution with the standards established under this section.
    
    (e)  A state agency may not begin construction of a new state building or a major renovation project before the design architect or engineer for the construction or renovation has:

    Sec. 447.008.  ENERGY-SAVING AND WATER-SAVING DEVICES OR MEASURES.  (a)  On approval by the state energy conservation office, a state agency that reduces its energy or water expenses may use any funds saved by the agency from appropriated utility funds for the purchase of an energy-saving or water-saving device or measure.  For purposes of this section, "energy-saving or water-saving device or measure" means a device or measure that directly reduces:
    
    (1)  energy or water costs;  or
    
    (2)  the energy or water consumption of equipment, including a lighting, heating, ventilation, air-conditioning system, or other water-using system, without materially altering the quality of the equipment.
    
    (b)  A state agency, in accordance with the recommendations of an energy or water audit, may purchase energy-saving and water-saving devices or measures from appropriated utility funds if the savings in utility funds projected by the audit will offset the purchase.  The agency shall retain in its files a copy of the recommendation and repayment schedule as evidence of the projected savings.
