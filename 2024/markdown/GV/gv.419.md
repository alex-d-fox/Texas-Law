The commission shall adopt rules relating to presentation of evidence of satisfactory completion of a program or course of instruction in another jurisdiction equivalent in content and quality to that required by the commission for approved fire protection education and training programs in this state and shall issue to a person meeting the rules and the requirements of Section [419.0325](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=419.0325) a certificate evidencing satisfaction of Subsections (a) and (b).  The commission may waive any certification requirement, except those under Section [419.0325](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=419.0325), for an applicant with a valid license from another state having certification requirements substantially equivalent to those of this state.
    
    (e)  Fire protection personnel serving under permanent appointment before September 1, 1972, are not required to meet a requirement of Subsection (a) or (b) as a condition of tenure or continued employment or for eligibility for a promotional examination for which they are otherwise eligible.  The fire protection personnel are eligible to attend training courses subject to commission rules.
    
    (f)  A local government may appoint a person to the position of head of the fire department, though the person is not certified by the commission as fire protection personnel, if the person either has at least 10 years' experience as a volunteer fire fighter or may be eligible to become certified under the provisions of Subsection (d) relating to other states or jurisdictions.  The appointment is on a temporary basis pending certification of the person as fire protection personnel by the commission under this subsection.  The temporary appointment may not be extended beyond one year by renewal of appointment or otherwise.  In addition to rules adopted under Subsection (d) relating to other states or jurisdictions, the commission shall adopt rules for purposes of this subsection relating to presentation of evidence that a person has been a volunteer fire fighter for the required period.  The rules may not include more stringent requirements on the nature of the volunteer fire departments with which a person may accumulate the required period of volunteer service than the requirements contained in the definition of an organized volunteer fire department under Chapter [615](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=615).  The commission shall certify as fire protection personnel a person who is serving as a temporarily appointed department head under this subsection and who:
    
    (1)  presents satisfactory evidence that the person has been a volunteer fire fighter for at least 10 years and passes the commission's basic certification examination administered under this subchapter on the first or second attempt;
    
    (2)  presents satisfactory evidence that the person is eligible to be certified as fire protection personnel under Subsection (d) and passes the commission's basic certification examination administered under this subchapter on the first or second attempt;  or
    
    (3)  satisfies the requirements of Subsections (a) and (b).
    
    (g)  This chapter does not prevent a fire department from assigning volunteer fire fighters, or other auxiliary fire fighters who are not fire protection personnel, to fire suppression, fire education, or fire station duties.
    
    (h)  This chapter does not prevent an employee of a local government from being a volunteer fire fighter.
