(a)  The permit office shall develop and by rule implement a comprehensive application procedure to expedite the identification and processing of required permits.  The permit office shall specify the permits to which the comprehensive application procedure applies.  A comprehensive application must be made on a form prescribed by the permit office.  The permit office shall consult with affected agencies in designing the form to ensure that the form provides the necessary information to allow agencies to identify which permits may be needed by the applicant.  The form must be designed primarily for the convenience of an applicant who is required to obtain multiple permits and must provide for concise and specific information necessary to determine which permits are or may be required of the particular applicant.
    
    (b)  Use of the comprehensive application procedure by the applicant is optional.  On request the permit office shall assist an applicant in preparing a comprehensive application, describe the procedures involved, and provide other appropriate information from the comprehensive permit information file.

    (e)  If a notified state agency responds that it does not have an interest in the permit requirements of the business undertaking, project, or activity described in the comprehensive application or does not respond within the period specified by Subsection (d), no permit under the jurisdiction of that agency is required for the undertaking, project, or activity described in the comprehensive application.  This subsection does not apply if the comprehensive application contains false, misleading, or deceptive information or fails to include pertinent information, the lack of which could reasonably lead a state agency to misjudge whether a permit under its jurisdiction is required.
    
    (f)  The permit office shall promptly provide the applicant with application forms and related information for all permits specified by the interested state agencies and shall advise the applicant that the forms are to be completed and submitted to the appropriate state agencies.
    
    (g)  An applicant may withdraw a comprehensive application at any time without forfeiture of any permit approval applied for or obtained under the comprehensive application procedures.
