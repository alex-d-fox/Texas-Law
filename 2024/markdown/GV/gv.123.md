    (1)  the integration of alcohol and other drug treatment services in the processing of cases in the judicial system;
    
    (2)  the use of a nonadversarial approach involving prosecutors and defense attorneys to promote public safety and to protect the due process rights of program participants;
    
    (3)  early identification and prompt placement of eligible participants in the program;
    
    (4)  access to a continuum of alcohol, drug, and other related treatment and rehabilitative services;
    
    (5)  monitoring of abstinence through weekly alcohol and other drug testing;

    (10)  development of partnerships with public agencies and community organizations.
    
    (b)  If a defendant successfully completes a drug court program, regardless of whether the defendant was convicted of the offense for which the defendant entered the program or whether the court deferred further proceedings without entering an adjudication of guilt, after notice to the state and a hearing on whether the defendant is otherwise entitled to the petition and whether issuance of the order is in the best interest of justice, the court shall enter an order of nondisclosure of criminal history record information under Subchapter [E-1](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=411.071), Chapter [411](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=411), as if the defendant had received a discharge and dismissal under Article [42A.111](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=42A.111), Code of Criminal Procedure, with respect to all records and files related to the defendant's arrest for the offense for which the defendant entered the program if the defendant:
    
    (1)  has not been previously convicted of an offense listed in Article [42A.054](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=42A.054), Code of Criminal Procedure, or a sexually violent offense, as defined by Article [62.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=62.001), Code of Criminal Procedure; and

    (c)  Notwithstanding Subsection (b), a defendant is not entitled to petition the court for an order of nondisclosure following successful completion of a drug court program if the defendant's entry into the program arose as the result of a conviction for an offense involving the operation of a motor vehicle while intoxicated.
