The first benefit payment date under this subsection is the later of the end of the month following the last month of employment or the end of the month following the month in which the person files an application for payment.  The first payment may not be made if the person has resumed employment with the reemploying municipality in a position that would make the person an employee.

Except as provided by Subsection (j), payment of the resumed benefit may not be made for any month during which the payment was suspended under this section as it existed on the date the person resumed employment with the reemploying municipality.
    
    (m)  At the time a person resumes receiving payment of an annuity under Subsection (k), the retirement system shall pay the person any lump-sum payment owed to the person under Subsection (j).
