If a state employee conducts official state business at duty points between the origin of the state employee's travel and the final duty point, the most cost-effective reasonably safe route between the origin and the final duty point shall include the intermediate duty points.

    (1)  the documentation states that the longer route is more cost effective;
    
    (2)  the documentation provides a reasonable justification for that statement; and
    
    (3)  the statement and justification are made by the chief administrator of the state agency making the reimbursement or by the chief administrator's designee.
