    (2)  treatment for chemical dependency;
    
    (3)  supervision of the person's work by a licensed attorney;
    
    (4)  submission to periodic drug testing;
    
    (5)  periodic reporting by the person to the board;  or

    (f)  A probationary license issued under this section expires on the second anniversary of the date on which the license is issued.  A person who holds a probationary license may apply for a renewal of the probationary license or for a regular license to practice law.  The board, after redetermination of the character and fitness of a person who holds a probationary license, may recommend to the supreme court that it grant the person a regular license to practice law.  The redetermination must include an evaluation of the person by a treatment facility.  The board may not recommend to the supreme court that the person be granted a regular license to practice law unless the board finds that the person has successfully completed treatment and has been free from chemical dependency for the preceding two years.
    
    (g)  The supreme court shall adopt rules under which the board and the State Bar of Texas jointly develop and fund a program for evaluation and referral to treatment for persons who have been issued a probationary license under this section.

    (i)  On request, the board in coordination with the State Bar of Texas shall inform a member of the public whether a particular person holds a probationary license.  Any information that forms the basis for the issuance of the probationary license is confidential.
