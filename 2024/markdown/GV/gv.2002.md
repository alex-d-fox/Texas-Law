The secretary of state shall report any shortfall attributed to the free Internet and electronic bulletin board services to the Legislative Budget Board in its biennial budget.  If a shortfall occurs, the secretary of state shall also request the appropriation of funds for the next biennial budget in the amount of the shortfall to continue the Internet and electronic bulletin board services at no charge.  If the requested funds are not appropriated, the secretary of state may, at the beginning of the next state fiscal year, charge user fees for the Internet and electronic bulletin board services in an amount that will compensate the secretary of state for the revenue shortfall.
