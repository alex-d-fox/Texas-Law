    Sec. 854.003.  EFFECTIVE DATE OF RETIREMENT.  (a)  Except as provided by Subsections (b) and (d), the effective date of a member's service retirement is the date the member designates at the time the member applies for retirement under Section [854.101](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=854.101), but the date must be the last day of a calendar month and may not precede the date the member terminates employment with all participating municipalities.
    
    (b)  If a member dies before retirement and an annuity becomes payable under Section [854.105](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=854.105), the member is considered to have retired on the last day of the month immediately preceding the month in which death occurred, except as provided by Subsection (e).
    
    (c)  Except as provided by Subsections (b) and (d), the effective date of a member's disability retirement is the date designated on the application for retirement filed by or for the member as provided by Section [854.301](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=854.301), but the date must be the last day of a calendar month and may not precede the date the member terminates employment with all participating municipalities.
    
    (d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle, each distribution of a benefit under this subtitle must be determined and made in accordance with Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and its subsequent amendments, including the minimum incidental death benefit requirements of Section 401(a)(9)(G) of that code.  The board of trustees may adopt rules it determines necessary to comply with the distribution requirements, including rules under which a person is considered to have retired as a result of those requirements.
    
    (e)  If the person who is eligible to receive an annuity under Subsection (b) is the member's surviving spouse, the person may elect, by notifying the retirement system not later than the 180th day after the date of the member's death, to leave the member's accumulated contributions on deposit with the retirement system until the date the member would have been eligible for service retirement.  If a surviving spouse makes an election under this subsection, the deceased member is considered to have retired on the last day of the month in which the member would have attained an age for service retirement eligibility.  An election under this subsection is revocable before the payment of the first annuity payment by filing a written application approved by the board of trustees to receive the member's accumulated contributions.

(a)  A retiree who is receiving payments of an annuity for the retiree's life but with payments to continue if the retiree dies until a determined number of payments have been made may, with the consent of the retiree's spouse if there is one, revoke any existing selection and designation of beneficiary nominated to receive any monthly payments that may become due under the annuity after the retiree's death and may select a new beneficiary to whom the monthly payments are to be made.  
    
    (b)  A person who, as beneficiary of a deceased retiree, is receiving monthly payments of any fixed-term annuity described by Subsection (a) may select and designate a person to whom will be paid any monthly payments that may be due under the annuity after the death of the beneficiary making the designation.

    (2)  the domestic relations order specifies that one of the two annuities is payable over the remaining life of the retiree, with no payments to be made under that annuity after the death of the retiree;
    
    (3)  the domestic relations order specifies that the annuity payable to the alternate payee is payable over the remaining life of that person, with no payments to be made under that annuity after the death of the alternate payee named in the order;  and
    
    (4)  the domestic relations order specifies that the portion of the benefit payable to the alternate payee is stated as a fixed percentage of the present benefit payable to the retiree, which percentage may not exceed 50 percent of a benefit provided under Section [854.104](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=854.104)(c)(2) and may not exceed 75 percent of a benefit provided under Section [854.104](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=854.104)(c)(5) .
    
    (e)  The division of an annuity under Subsection (d) is effective when the order is determined by the retirement system to be a qualified domestic relations order, and the amount of each of the two annuities shall be computed by the retirement system at that time, based on tables that have been adopted by the retirement system and in effect at that time, so that the two annuities are actuarially equivalent at the time of division to the annuity being divided.
    
    (f)  If a divorce decree or a qualified domestic relations order, as that term is defined by Section [804.001](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=804.001), so provides, the benefit payable to a retiree who is receiving payments of an annuity for the retiree's life with payments to continue after the retiree's death until the death of another person under Section [854.104](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=854.104)(c)(1), (2), or (5), [854.305](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=854.305)(c), or [854.410](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=854.410)(c) may be increased to the amount that would have been payable if the retiree had selected an annuity payable only during the retiree's lifetime if:
    
    (1)  the proceeding in which the decree or order is entered terminates the marriage between the retiree and the person who was designated to receive the continued payment after the retiree's death;
    
    (2)  the decree or order awards the retiree all benefits resulting from the retiree's participation in the retirement system; and
    
    (3)  the decree or order is signed after December 31, 1999.
    
    (g)  A decree or order under Subsection (f) applies only to annuity payments made after the date the retirement system receives and approves the decree or order as complying with Subsection (f).

(a)  A member who is eligible for service retirement and who terminates employment with all participating municipalities may apply for a partial lump-sum distribution under this section.  The board of trustees may adopt rules to allow the beneficiary of a deceased member who at the time of death was eligible for service retirement but had not retired to make the same election that the member could have made under this section at the time of retirement.
    
    (b)  The amount of a lump-sum distribution under this section may not exceed three-fourths of the total contributions and accumulated interest in the member's individual account at the time of the member's retirement.
    
    (c)  Subject to the limitation in Subsection (b), the member may elect to have the lump-sum distribution be equal to the monthly annuity payments, excluding any distributive benefit payments, that the member would have received if the member had selected the standard service retirement annuity described in Section [854.103](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=854.103) over a period of:

If a payment is made under Section [854.502](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=854.502), the amount of the lump-sum distribution will be considered to be included in the payments made by reason of the annuity.

    (g)  The partial lump-sum distribution under Subsection (f) shall be paid as a single payment, payable at the same time as the first monthly annuity payment paid to the alternate payee, and shall be deducted from the sum used in computing the alternate payee's annuity.  The amount of the lump-sum distribution shall be equal to the monthly payments, excluding any distributive benefit payments that the alternate payee would otherwise have received, during the:
    
    (1)  12 months after the effective date of the member's retirement;
    
    (2)  24 months after the effective date of the member's retirement;  or

    Sec. 854.104.  OPTIONAL SERVICE RETIREMENT ANNUITY.  (a)  Instead of the standard service retirement annuity payable under Section [854.103](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=854.103), a retiring member may elect to receive an optional service retirement annuity under this section.
    
    (b)  An optional service retirement annuity is payable throughout the life of the retiree and is actuarially adjusted from the standard service retirement annuity to its actuarial equivalent under the option selected under Subsection (c).
    
    (c)  An eligible person may select an optional annuity that provides that:
    
    (1)  after the retiree's death, the reduced annuity is payable throughout the life of a person designated by the retiree;
    
    (2)  after the retiree's death, one-half of the reduced annuity is payable throughout the life of a person designated by the retiree;
    
    (3)  if the retiree dies before 120 monthly annuity payments have been made, the remainder of the 120 payments are payable to the retiree's beneficiary or, if one does not exist, to the retiree's estate;
    
    (4)  if the retiree dies before 180 monthly annuity payments have been made, the remainder of the 180 payments are payable to the retiree's beneficiary or, if one does not exist, to the retiree's estate;
    
    (5)  after the retiree's death, three-fourths of the reduced annuity is payable throughout the life of a person designated by the retiree;  or
    
    (6)  if the retiree dies before 60 monthly payments have been made, the remainder of the 60 payments are payable to the retiree's beneficiary or, if one does not exist, to the retiree's estate.
    
    (d)  An option under Subsection (c) applies to both prior and current service annuities, except that prior service annuities are subject to reduction under Section [855.308](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=855.308)(f).
    
    (e)  To select an optional service retirement annuity, a member or retiree must make the selection and designate a beneficiary on a form prescribed by and filed with the board of trustees before the 31st day after the effective date of retirement.
    
    (f)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle, each distribution to any person or estate under this subtitle must be made in accordance with Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. Section 401(a)(9)).
    
    (g)  If a person who retires after August 31, 1997, elects a reduced retirement annuity that is payable until the death of the last to die of the retiree and a person designated under Subsection (e), and if the retiree survives the other person, the monthly payments to the retiree will be increased to the amounts that would have been payable if the retiree at the time of retirement had elected to receive an annuity payable only during the retiree's life, and adjustments had been made for any applicable postretirement increases in that benefit.  The increased benefit becomes payable the month after the month in which the person designated under Subsection (e) dies and continues until the retiree dies.
    
    (h)  Subsection (i) applies only to a person who retired before September 1, 1997, and who elected, at retirement, to receive a reduced annuity that is payable until the death of the last to die of the retiree and a person designated as a beneficiary under Subsection (e).
    
    (i)  If both the retiree and the beneficiary described in Subsection (h) are alive, they may jointly elect in the manner provided by Subsection (j) to modify the annuity being received.  An annuity modified under this subsection:
    
    (1)  begins with the first payment after one calendar month has passed since the date the form under Subsection (j) is filed, with the amount of the monthly payments, while the beneficiary is alive, being the actuarial equivalent of the previous annuity;  and
    
    (2)  increases to the amount of the standard service retirement annuity that the retiree would otherwise be entitled to receive if the retiree had not selected the optional annuity with adjustments made for any postretirement increase in that benefit and becomes payable the month following the month in which the beneficiary dies and continues until the retiree dies.
    
    (j)  To make the election under Subsection (i), the retiree and beneficiary must execute and acknowledge, as provided by this subsection, a form stating that they are requesting a modification under Subsection (i) and that they understand that the modified annuity will be smaller than the standard service annuity while they are both living and if the beneficiary survives the member.  The acknowledgment must be on a form prescribed by the board of trustees and be made before a notary public or other officer authorized to take acknowledgments.  The retiree and beneficiary must file the executed form with the retirement system before January 1, 2003.

    (2)  an optional annuity in the same manner as if the member had made the selection, subject only to the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and its subsequent amendments, as to the length of time over which the payments can be made.
    
    (g)  If there is not a person who is eligible to make a selection under Subsections (c)-(f), the executor or administrator of the member's estate may elect:
    
    (1)  for an estate beneficiary to receive the optional annuity under Section [854.104](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=854.104)(c)(4), in which case the member will be considered to have retired on the last day of the month immediately preceding the month in which death occurred;  or
    
    (2)  for the estate to receive a refund of the member's accumulated contributions under Section [854.501](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=854.501), in which case the member will be considered to have been a contributing member at the time of death.

    (1)  the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor, from December of the year immediately preceding the effective date of the person's retirement to the December that is 13 months before the effective date of the ordinance providing the increase;  and
    
    (2)  30 percent, 50 percent, or 70 percent, as specified by the governing body in the ordinance, except that if the governing body has specified a different percentage in an ordinance adopted under Section [853.404](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=853.404)(c) and in effect on December 31, 1999, the percentage used in computing annuity increases for retirees of that municipality remains in effect until changed or discontinued under Section [853.404](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=853.404).
    
    (c)  Except as provided by Subsection (g), the effective date of an ordinance under this section is January 1 of the year that begins after the year in which the governing body adopts and notifies the retirement system of the ordinance.
    
    (d)  An increase in an annuity that was reduced because of an option selection is reducible in the same proportion and in the same manner that the original annuity was reduced.
    
    (e)  If a computation under Subsection (b) does not result in an increase in the amount of an annuity, the amount of the annuity may not be changed under this section.
    
    (f)  The amount by which an increase under this section exceeds all previously granted increases to an annuitant is payable as a prior service annuity, is an obligation of the municipality's account in the benefit accumulation fund, and is subject to reduction under Section [855.308](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=855.308)(f).
    
    (g)  An ordinance under this section may not take effect until it is approved by the board of trustees as meeting the requirements of this section.  The board may not approve an ordinance unless the actuary first determines that all obligations charged against the municipality's account in the benefit accumulation fund, including the obligations proposed in the ordinance, can be funded by the municipality within its maximum contribution rate and within its amortization period as in effect on the effective date of the increases.
    
    (h)  A governing body may not authorize and provide for annuity increases under this section unless it simultaneously provides for updated service credits under Subchapter E of Chapter [853](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=853).

    (g)  If a person who retires after August 31, 1997, elects a reduced retirement annuity that is payable until the death of the last to die of the retiree and a person designated under Subsection (e), and if the retiree survives the other person, the monthly payments to the retiree will be increased to the amounts that would have been payable if the retiree had elected to receive an annuity payable only during the retiree's life, and adjustments had been made for any applicable postretirement increases in that benefit.  The increased benefit becomes payable the month after the month in which the person designated under Subsection (e) dies and continues until the retiree dies.

    Sec. 854.409.  MEDICAL EXAMINATION OF RETIREES.  (a)  The retirement system may require, by written request, a disability retiree under this subchapter who is younger than 60 years of age to undergo a medical examination and provide current medical and other relevant information reaffirming the status of the retiree as meeting the requirements for certification of occupational disability under Section [854.407](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=854.407)(b).

    (b)  If a disability retiree refuses to submit to a medical examination or fails to provide current medical or other information requested under Subsection (a), the retirement system may suspend payments of the disability annuity as provided by this section.

    (e)  If the medical board finds that a disability retiree under this subchapter has experienced medical improvement to the extent that the disability retiree no longer meets the requirements for certification of occupational disability under Section [854.407](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=854.407)(b), the medical board shall certify the medical board's findings and submit the findings to the director.  If the director concurs in the medical board's findings under this section, the director may adopt the findings, and the retirement system may suspend payments of the disability annuity and take other action as the retirement system, in the retirement system's discretion, considers equitable and appropriate to address the situation, until the disability retiree attains 60 years of age.
    
    (f)  The suspension of a benefit under this section does not suspend payment of a benefit to an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order.

The increased benefit becomes payable the month after the month in which the person designated under Subsection (e) dies and continues until the retiree dies.

    (2)  that the member made a required contribution to the retirement system as an employee of a municipality participating in the supplemental death benefits fund for the month immediately preceding the first full month in which the member was unable to engage in gainful occupation.
    
    (d)  Once established, extended coverage of a person in the supplemental death benefit program continues until the last day of the month in which:
    
    (1)  the member returns to work as an employee of a participating municipality;
    
    (2)  the board of trustees finds that the member is able to engage in gainful occupation;
    
    (3)  the person's membership in the retirement system is terminated;  or
    
    (4)  the member retires under this subtitle.
    
    (e)  The board of trustees by rule may require a member to submit to it annual proof of continued inability to engage in gainful occupation.  The board may require a member to undergo a medical examination by a physician designated by the board.  Failure of a member to undergo a medical examination as required by this subsection is a ground for the board's finding that the member has become able to engage in gainful occupation.
    
    (f)  If a member included in the coverage of the supplemental death benefit program becomes eligible to apply for the extended coverage but fails to comply with Subsections (b) and (c) before the member's death, the member will be considered to have had the extended coverage if proof is furnished that the member could have qualified for extended coverage if application for the coverage had been made according to Subsections (b) and (c) and that the death occurred within six months after the date the coverage of the supplemental death benefit program was discontinued under Section [854.601](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=854.601).

    Sec. 854.603.  MEMBER SUPPLEMENTAL DEATH BENEFIT.  (a)  If a person included in the coverage or extended coverage of the supplemental death benefit program dies, a lump-sum supplemental death benefit is payable from the supplemental death benefits fund in an amount equal to the current annual salary of the member at the time of death.
    
    (b)  Except as provided by Subsection (c), the current annual salary of a member is computed as the amount paid to the member for service on which contributions were made to the retirement system during the 12 months immediately preceding the month of death.  If a member did not receive compensation for service in each of the 12 months immediately preceding the month of death, the member's current annual salary is computed by converting to an annual basis the amount paid to the member on which contributions were made to the system during the period of employment within the 12-month period.  If a member did not receive compensation for service in any of the 12 months immediately preceding the month of death, the member's current annual salary is computed by converting to an annual basis the rate of compensation payable to the member during the month of death.
    
    (c)  The current annual salary of a member included in the extended coverage of the supplemental death benefit program is computed in the manner provided by Subsection (b) but as if the member had died during the first month of extended coverage.
    
    (d)  If a member makes contributions to the retirement system during the same month as an employee of more than one municipality participating in the supplemental death benefits fund, a death benefit is payable only on the basis of the member's most recent employment.
    
    (e)  The board of trustees by rule may require such proof of compensation and periods of employment as it finds necessary.

    Sec. 854.604.  RETIREE SUPPLEMENTAL DEATH BENEFIT.
