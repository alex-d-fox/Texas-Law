    (e)  When a district, statutory probate, constitutional county, or statutory county court judge is assigned under this chapter to a court outside his own district or county, the judge, in addition to all other compensation authorized by law, is entitled to receive his actual expenses in going to and returning from his assignment and his actual living expenses while in the performance of his duties under the assignment.

The state shall pay the per diem in the same manner that it pays the judge's salary on certificates of approval by the chief justice or the presiding judge of the administrative region in which the judge resides.
    
    (g)  An active judge or justice of the supreme court, the court of criminal appeals, or a court of appeals assigned under this subchapter is not entitled to receive any additional compensation for serving as a visiting judge.  A court of appeals justice assigned to a court outside his own court of appeals district, a justice of the supreme court, or a judge of the court of criminal appeals is entitled to receive actual expenses in going to and returning from assignment and actual living expenses while in the performance of duties under the assignment.  The county in which the duties are performed shall pay the expenses out of the county's general fund on accounts certified and approved by the presiding judge of the administrative region for that county.
    
    (h)  Notwithstanding Subsection (c), the salary from the state of a retired judge or justice assigned to a district court is determined pro rata based on the sum of the regular judge's salary from the county plus the amount of the state base salary paid to a district judge as set by the General Appropriations Act in accordance with Section [659.012](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=659.012)(a).

    (j)  A judge or justice who sits as an assigned judge for half a day or less shall be compensated in an amount that is equal to one-half of the amount to which a judge or justice is entitled for sitting as an assigned judge for a full day under this section.
    
    (k)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a former, retired, or active judge is not entitled to compensation paid by the state when the judge sits as an assigned judge for a statutory county court.
    
    (l)  A judge of a district, statutory probate, constitutional county, or statutory county court who is assigned under this chapter to a court in a county other than the county in which the judge serves is not an employee of the other county.

    Sec. 74.121.  TRANSFER OF CASES;  EXCHANGE OF BENCHES.  (a)  The judges of constitutional county courts, statutory county courts, justice courts, and small claims courts in a county may transfer cases to and from the dockets of their respective courts, except that a case may not be transferred from one court to another without the consent of the judge of the court to which it is transferred and may not be transferred unless it is within the jurisdiction of the court to which it is transferred.  The judges of those courts within a county may exchange benches and courtrooms with each other so that if one is absent, disabled, or disqualified, the other may hold court for him without the necessity of transferring the case.  Either judge may hear all or any part of a case pending in court and may rule and enter orders on and continue, determine, or render judgment on all or any part of the case without the necessity of transferring it to his own docket.  A judge may not sit or act in a case unless it is within the jurisdiction of his court.  Each judgment and order shall be entered in the minutes of the court in which the case is pending.
    
    (b)(1) The judge of a statutory county court may transfer a case to the docket of the district court, except that a case may not be transferred without the consent of the judge of the court to which it is being transferred and may not be transferred unless it is within the jurisdiction of the court to which it is transferred.
    
    (2)  Notwithstanding Subdivision (1), in matters of concurrent jurisdiction, a judge of a statutory county court in Midland County and a judge of a district court in Midland County may exchange benches and courtrooms with each other and may transfer cases between their dockets in the same manner that judges of district courts exchange benches and transfer cases under Section [24.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=24.003).
    
    (c)  When a case is transferred from one court to another as provided by this section, all processes, writs, bonds, recognizances, or other obligations issued from the transferring court are returnable to the court to which the case is transferred as if originally issued by that court.  The obligees in all bonds and recognizances taken in and for a court from which a case is transferred, and all witnesses summoned to appear in a court from which a case is transferred, are required to appear before the court to which the case is transferred as if originally required to appear before the court to which the transfer is made.
