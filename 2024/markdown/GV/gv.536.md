    Sec. 536.003.  DEVELOPMENT OF QUALITY-BASED OUTCOME AND PROCESS MEASURES.  (a)  The commission shall develop quality-based outcome and process measures that promote the provision of efficient, quality health care and that can be used in the child health plan program and Medicaid to implement quality-based payments for acute care services and long-term services and supports across all delivery models and payment systems, including fee-for-service and managed care payment systems.  Subject to Subsection (a-1), the commission, in developing outcome and process measures under this section, must include measures that are based on potentially preventable events and that advance quality improvement and innovation.  The commission may change measures developed:
    
    (1)  to promote continuous system reform, improved quality, and reduced costs; and
    
    (2)  to account for managed care organizations added to a service area.
    
    (a-1)  The outcome measures based on potentially preventable events must:
    
    (1)  allow for rate-based determination of health care provider performance compared to statewide norms; and
    
    (2)  be risk-adjusted to account for the severity of the illnesses of patients served by the provider.
    
    (b)  To the extent feasible, the commission shall develop outcome and process measures:
    
    (1)  consistently across all child health plan program and Medicaid delivery models and payment systems;
    
    (2)  in a manner that takes into account appropriate patient risk factors, including the burden of chronic illness on a patient and the severity of a patient's illness;
    
    (3)  that will have the greatest effect on improving quality of care and the efficient use of services, including acute care services and long-term services and supports;
    
    (4)  that are similar to outcome and process measures used in the private sector, as appropriate;
    
    (5)  that reflect effective coordination of acute care services and long-term services and supports;
    
    (6)  that can be tied to expenditures; and
    
    (7)  that reduce preventable health care utilization and costs.
    
    (c)  The commission shall, to the extent feasible, align outcome and process measures developed under this section with measures required or recommended under reporting guidelines established by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or another federal agency.
    
    (d)  The executive commissioner by rule may require managed care organizations and physicians and other health care providers participating in the child health plan program and Medicaid to report to the commission in a format specified by the executive commissioner information necessary to develop outcome and process measures under this section.
    
    (e)  If the commission increases physician and other health care provider reimbursement rates under the child health plan program or Medicaid as a result of an increase in the amounts appropriated for the programs for a state fiscal biennium as compared to the preceding state fiscal biennium, the commission shall, to the extent permitted under federal law and to the extent otherwise possible considering other relevant factors, correlate the increased reimbursement rates with the quality-based outcome and process measures developed under this section.
    
    (f)  The commission, in coordination with the Department of State Health Services, shall develop and implement a quality-based outcome measure for the child health plan program and Medicaid to annually measure the percentage of child health plan program enrollees or Medicaid recipients with HIV infection, regardless of age, whose most recent viral load test indicates a viral load of less than 200 copies per milliliter of blood.
    
    (g)  The commission shall include aggregate, nonidentifying data collected using the quality-based outcome measure described by Subsection (f) in the annual report required by Section [536.008](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=536.008) and may include the data in any other report required by this chapter.  The commission shall determine the appropriateness of including the quality-based outcome measure described by Subsection (f) in the quality-based payments and payment systems developed under Sections [536.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=536.004) and [536.051](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=536.051).

    (A)  reduce unnecessary administrative burdens; and
    
    (B)  align quality-based payment incentives for physicians and other health care providers with the Medicare program; and
    
    (3)  alternative payment methodologies within the system that are used in the Medicare program, modified as necessary to account for programmatic differences, and that will achieve cost savings and improve quality of care in the child health plan program and Medicaid.
    
    (d)  In developing quality-based payment systems under this chapter, the commission shall ensure that a managed care organization or physician or other health care provider will not be rewarded by the system for withholding or delaying the provision of medically necessary care.

(a)  The commission shall establish payment initiatives to test the effectiveness of quality-based payment systems, alternative payment methodologies, and high-quality, cost-effective health care delivery models that provide incentives to physicians and other health care providers to develop health care interventions for child health plan program enrollees or Medicaid recipients, or both, that will:

    (3)  promote prevention and wellness;
    
    (4)  increase the use of evidence-based best practices;
    
    (5)  increase appropriate physician and other health care provider collaboration;
    
    (6)  contain costs; and
    
    (7)  improve integration of acute care services and long-term services and supports, including discharge planning from acute care services to community-based long-term services and supports.

(a)  Subject to this subchapter, the commission, after consulting with appropriate stakeholders representing nursing facility providers with an interest in the provision of long-term services and supports, may develop and implement quality-based payment systems for Medicaid long-term services and supports providers designed to improve quality of care and reduce the provision of unnecessary services.  A quality-based payment system developed under this section must base payments to providers on quality and efficiency measures that may include measurable wellness and prevention criteria and use of evidence-based best practices, sharing a portion of any realized cost savings achieved by the provider, and ensuring quality of care outcomes, including a reduction in potentially preventable events.
    
    (b)  The commission may develop a quality-based payment system for Medicaid long-term services and supports providers under this subchapter only if implementing the system would be feasible and cost-effective.
