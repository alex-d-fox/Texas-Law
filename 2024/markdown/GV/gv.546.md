    Sec. 546.0002.  LONG-TERM CARE PLAN; COORDINATION OF SERVICES.  (a)  In this section, "long-term care" means the provision of health care, personal care, and assistance related to health and social services over a sustained period to individuals of all ages and their families, regardless of the setting in which the care is provided.
    
    (b)  In conjunction with appropriate state agencies, the executive commissioner shall develop a plan for access to individualized long-term care services for individuals with functional limitations or medical needs and their families that assists those individuals in achieving and maintaining the greatest possible independence, autonomy, and quality of life.
    
    (c)  The guiding principles and goals of the plan that focus on the individual and the individual's family must:
    
    (1)  recognize that it is the policy of this state that:
    
    (A)  children should grow up in families; and
    
    (B)  individuals with disabilities and elderly individuals should reside in the setting of their choice; and
    
    (2)  ensure that an individual needing assistance and the individual's family will have:
    
    (A)  the maximum possible control over their services;
    
    (B)  a choice of a broad, comprehensive array of services designed to meet individual needs; and
    
    (C)  the easiest possible access to appropriate care and support, regardless of the area of this state in which they reside.
    
    (d)  The guiding principles and goals of the plan that focus on services and delivery of those services by the state must:
    
    (1)  emphasize the development of home-based and community-based services and housing alternatives to complement the long-term care services already in existence;
    
    (2)  ensure that the services will be of the highest possible quality, with a minimum amount of regulation, structure, and complexity at the service level;
    
    (3)  recognize that maximum independence and autonomy represent major goals, and with those comes a certain degree of risk;
    
    (4)  maximize resources to the greatest extent possible, with the consumer receiving only the services that the consumer prefers and that are indicated by a functional needs assessment; and
    
    (5)  structure the service delivery system to support these goals, ensuring that any necessary system complexity is at the administrative level rather than at the client level.
    
    (e)  The commission shall coordinate state services to ensure that:
    
    (1)  the roles and responsibilities of agencies providing long-term care are clarified; and

    (b)  The commission, the Texas Education Agency, and the Texas Workforce Commission shall jointly adopt and implement an employment-first policy in accordance with the state's policy under Subsection (a). The policy must:
    
    (1)  affirm that an individual with a disability is able to meet the same employment standards as an individual who does not have a disability;
    
    (2)  ensure that all working-age individuals with disabilities, including young adults, are offered factual information regarding employment as an individual with a disability, including the relationship between an individual's earned income and the individual's public benefits;
    
    (3)  ensure that individuals with disabilities are given the opportunity to understand and explore options for education or training, including postsecondary, graduate, and postgraduate education, vocational or technical training, or other training, as pathways to employment;

(a)  The commission and appropriate health and human services agencies shall implement a comprehensive, effectively working plan that provides a system of services and support to foster independence and productivity and provide meaningful opportunities for an individual with a disability to reside in the most appropriate care setting, considering:

    Sec. 546.0455.  INTEREST LIST MANAGEMENT FOR CERTAIN CHILDREN ENROLLED IN MEDICALLY DEPENDENT CHILDREN (MDCP) WAIVER PROGRAM.  (a)  This section applies only to a child who is enrolled in the medically dependent children (MDCP) waiver program but becomes ineligible for services under the program because the child no longer meets:
    
    (1)  the level of care criteria for medical necessity for nursing facility care; or
    
    (2)  the age requirement for the program.
    
    (b)  A legally authorized representative of a child who is notified by the commission that the child is no longer eligible for the medically dependent children (MDCP) waiver program following a Medicaid fair hearing, or without a Medicaid fair hearing if the representative opted in writing to forgo the hearing, may request that the commission:
    
    (1)  return the child to the interest list for the program unless the child is ineligible due to the child's age; or
    
    (2)  place the child on the interest list for another Section 1915(c) waiver program.
    
    (c)  At the time a child's legally authorized representative makes a request under Subsection (b), the commission shall:

    (A)  on the interest list for the medically dependent children (MDCP) waiver program in the first position on the list; or
    
    (B)  except as provided by Subdivision (3), on the interest list for another Section 1915(c) waiver program in a position relative to other individuals on the list that is based on the date the child was initially placed on the interest list for the medically dependent children (MDCP) waiver program;
    
    (2)  except as provided by Subdivision (3), for a child who becomes ineligible for the reason described by Subsection (a)(2), place the child on the interest list for another Section 1915(c) waiver program in a position relative to other individuals on the list that is based on the date the child was initially placed on the interest list for the medically dependent children (MDCP) waiver program; or
    
    (3)  for a child who becomes ineligible for a reason described by Subsection (a) and who is already on an interest list for another Section 1915(c) waiver program, move the child to a position on the interest list relative to other individuals on the list that is based on the date the child was initially placed on the interest list for the medically dependent children (MDCP) waiver program, if that date is earlier than the date the child was initially placed on the interest list for the other waiver program.
    
    (d)  Notwithstanding Subsection (c)(1)(B) or (c)(2), a child may be placed on an interest list for a Section 1915(c) waiver program in the position described by those subsections only if the child has previously been placed on the interest list for that waiver program.
    
    (e)  At the time the commission provides notice to a legally authorized representative that a child is no longer eligible for the medically dependent children (MDCP) waiver program following a Medicaid fair hearing, or without a Medicaid fair hearing if the representative opted in writing to forgo the hearing, the commission shall inform the representative in writing about:
    
    (1)  the options under this section for placing the child on an interest list; and
