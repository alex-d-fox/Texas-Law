    Sec. 842.052.  VOLUNTARY TERMINATION OF PARTICIPATION.

    (1)  all benefits accrued before the date specified in the termination agreement and payable on or after that date in accordance with Subsection (e); and
    
    (2)  all supplemental annuities.
    
    (b)  Beginning with the date specified in the termination agreement, additional employee contributions or deposits may not be made to a member's account and additional service with the subdivision may not be credited to a member, except as authorized by the board.  Except as otherwise provided by this section, all other retirement plan provisions then in effect remain in effect.
    
    (c)  Beginning with the date specified in the termination agreement, the subdivision's account in the subdivision accumulation fund ceases to receive allocations under this subtitle for any prior, current, or future plan year, except as authorized by the board.
    
    (d)  On full performance of the termination agreement, the subdivision is released from all liability for its accrued benefits and supplemental annuities.

    (f)  A member vested under Subsection (e) or Section [842.051](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=842.051)(a) is an eligible member under Section [844.407](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=844.407).  For the purpose of determining any death benefit payable under Section [844.402](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=844.402), the member's individual account consists only of the deposits and contributions made by the member and the accumulated interest attributable to those amounts.

    (2)  the subdivision has ceased to exist, is in the process of dissolving, or is changing its operational form;
    
    (3)  benefits accrued for service with the subdivision may be at risk of forfeiture;
    
    (4)  the retirement system no longer serves as an effective program for providing retirement, disability, and death benefits to the employees of the subdivision because of the action or inaction of the subdivision or because of a significant change in covered payroll, number of contributing members, workforce composition, general revenues, or other circumstances of the subdivision; or
    
    (5)  the continued participation of the subdivision is not in the best interest of the retirement system, the subdivision, the employees of the subdivision, or the other participating subdivisions.
    
    (b)  Beginning with a date specified by the board, additional employee deposits or contributions may not be made to a member's account with the subdivision and additional service with the subdivision may not be credited to a member, except as authorized by the board.

The retirement system shall pay any amount remaining in the subdivision's account after satisfaction of all the subdivision's pension liabilities to the subdivision or its governmental successor in interest in accordance with Section [845.317](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=845.317)(b).
    
    (e)  If the actuarial equivalent value of pension benefits exceeds the assets in the subdivision's account, the subdivision or its governmental successor in interest may make a contribution in any amount to the subdivision's account.  The retirement system shall transfer the assets of the subdivision's account in the subdivision accumulation fund to appropriate funds within the system and allocate the assets as provided by Sections 842.054-842.057.

    (c)  An error caused by an act or omission of a participating subdivision may be corrected:
    
    (1)  by the subdivision on its own motion if approved by the retirement system and if satisfactory proof of the error is submitted to the retirement system; or

    (e)  If the act of a third person causes the retirement system to make a payment of a survivor benefit or death benefit to someone other than the person entitled to the payment, the system shall, after receiving credible evidence of an erroneous payment, determine the beneficiary entitled to the benefit and, if necessary, adjust future payments to the extent practicable to ensure that the present value of the remainder of the benefit will be paid to the person entitled to it.
    
    (f)  The retirement system is not liable to any person for any payments described by Subsection (e) made before the date the system receives credible evidence of an erroneous payment.  Any payments made before that date are a complete discharge of the system's responsibility for those payments and benefits.
    
    (f-1)  If, pursuant to a valid application for a withdrawal or for retirement, the retirement system issues a check made payable to the applicant, properly addressed as directed on the application and sent by first-class mail, and the check is negotiated by any person, the system is not liable to any person with respect to the payment after the first anniversary of the date the check was mailed.
    
    (f-2)  If, pursuant to a valid application for a withdrawal or for retirement, the retirement system causes funds to be electronically transferred to the account specified on the application, the system is not liable to any person for that payment or any claim relating to the payment beginning on the date of the transfer.
    
    (g)  A recipient who receives a payment to which the recipient is not entitled holds the payment in constructive trust for the person entitled to the payment.
