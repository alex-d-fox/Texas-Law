    Sec. 432.015.  COMMANDING OFFICER'S NONJUDICIAL PUNISHMENT.  (a)  Under regulations as may be prescribed, any commanding officer may impose disciplinary punishments for minor offenses without the intervention of a court-martial in accordance with this subchapter.  There is no right to trial by court-martial in lieu of nonjudicial punishment imposed under this section.  Only the governor, the adjutant general, or an officer of a general or flag rank in command may delegate the powers under this section to a principal assistant who is a member of the state military forces.
    
    (b)  Any accused person who is facing discipline under this section shall be afforded the opportunity to be represented by defense counsel having the qualifications prescribed under Section [432.046](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=432.046)(b), if such a counsel is reasonably available.  Otherwise, the accused shall be afforded the opportunity to be represented by any available commissioned officer of the accused's choice.

In all proceedings, the accused is allowed three duty days, or longer on written justification, to reply to the notification of intent to impose punishment under this section.
    
    (c)  Any commanding officer may impose on enlisted members in the officer's command:
    
    (1)  a reprimand;
    
    (2)  a fine equal to an amount that is not more than seven days' pay; and
    
    (3)  a reduction to the next inferior pay grade.
    
    (d)  Any commanding officer of the grade of O-4 or above may impose on enlisted members in the officer's command:
    
    (1)  a reprimand;
    
    (2)  a fine equal to an amount that is not more than one month's pay; and
    
    (3)  a  reduction to the lowest or any intermediate pay grade, but an enlisted member in a pay grade above E-4 may not be reduced more than two pay grades.
    
    (e)  The governor, the adjutant general, an officer exercising general court-martial convening authority, or an officer of a general or flag rank in command may impose:
    
    (1)  on officers in the officer's command:
    
    (A)  a reprimand; and
    
    (B)  a fine equal to an amount that is not more than one month's pay; and
    
    (2)  on enlisted members in the officer's command, any punishment authorized under Subsection (d).
    
    (f)  The officer who imposes the punishment authorized in this section or the officer's successor in command may at any time suspend, set aside, reduce, or remit any part or amount of the punishment and restore all rights, privileges, and property affected.  The mitigated punishment may not be for a greater amount than the punishment mitigated. When mitigating reduction in grade to a fine, the amount of the fine may not be greater than the amount that could have been imposed initially under this section by the officer who imposed the punishment mitigated.
    
    (g)  A person punished under this section who considers the punishment unjust or disproportionate to the offense may, through the proper channel, appeal to the next superior authority not later than the 15th day after the date the punishment is either announced or sent to the accused, as the commanding officer determines.  The appeal shall be promptly forwarded and decided, but the person punished may in the meantime be required to undergo the punishment adjudged.  The superior authority may exercise the same powers with respect to the punishment imposed as may be exercised under Subsection (f) by the officer who imposed the punishment.  Before acting on an appeal from a punishment, the authority who is to act on the appeal may refer the case to a judge advocate for consideration and advice.
    
    (h)  The imposition and enforcement of disciplinary punishment under this section for any act or omission is not a bar to trial by court-martial or a civilian court of competent jurisdiction for a serious crime or offense growing out of the same act or omission and not properly punishable under this section, but the fact that a disciplinary punishment has been enforced may be shown by the accused on trial and, when shown, shall be considered in determining the measure of punishment to be adjudged in the event of a finding of guilty.
    
    (i)  Regulations may prescribe the form of records to be kept of proceedings under this section and that certain categories of those proceedings shall be in writing.

After such a request, the accused may not be tried by a general or special court-martial the membership of which does not include enlisted members in a number comprising at least one-third of the total membership of the court, unless eligible members cannot be obtained because of physical conditions or military exigencies.  If a sufficient number of enlisted members cannot be obtained, the court may be convened and the trial held without them, but the convening authority shall make a detailed written statement, to be appended to the record, stating why they could not be obtained.  In this subsection, "unit" means a regularly organized body of the state military forces not larger than a company, squadron, division of the naval militia, or body corresponding to a company, squadron, or division.

    (c)  A person subject to this chapter may not compel any person to make a statement or produce evidence before a military tribunal if the statement or evidence is not material to the issue and may tend to degrade him.

    Sec. 432.053.  INVESTIGATION.  (a)  A charge or specification may not be referred to a general court-martial for trial until a thorough and impartial investigation of all the matters set forth has been made.  This investigation must include inquiry as to the truth of the matter set forth in the charges, consideration of the form of charges, and a recommendation as to the disposition that should be made of the case in the interest of justice and discipline.
    
    (b)  The accused is entitled to be advised of the charges against him and of his right to be represented at that investigation by counsel.  On the accused's own request, he is entitled to be represented by civilian counsel if provided by him, or by military counsel of his own selection if that counsel is reasonably available, or by counsel detailed by the officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the command.  At that investigation full opportunity shall be given to the accused to cross-examine witnesses against him if they are available and to present anything he may desire in his own behalf, either in defense or mitigation, and the investigating officer shall examine available witnesses requested by the accused.

    (c)  If an investigation of the subject matter of an offense has been conducted before the accused is charged with the offense, and if the accused was present at the investigation and afforded the opportunities for representation, cross-examination, and presentation prescribed in Subsection (b), further investigation of that charge is not necessary under this section unless it is demanded by the accused after he is informed of the charge.  A demand for further investigation entitles the accused to recall witnesses for further cross-examination and to offer any new evidence in his own behalf.
    
    (d)  The requirements of this section are binding on all persons administering this chapter but failure to follow them does not constitute jurisdictional error.

    Sec. 432.070.  PLEAS OF ACCUSED.  (a)  If an accused after arraignment makes an irregular pleading or after a plea of guilty sets up matter inconsistent with the plea, if it appears that the accused has entered the plea of guilty improvidently or through lack of understanding of its meaning and effect, or if the accused fails or refuses to plead, a plea of not guilty shall be entered in the record, and the court shall proceed as though the accused had pleaded not guilty.
    
    (b)  With respect to a charge or specification to which a plea of guilty has been made by the accused and accepted by the military judge, or by a court-martial without a military judge, a finding of guilty on the charge or specification may, if permitted by regulations of the governor, be entered immediately without vote.  This finding constitutes the finding of the court unless the plea of guilty is withdrawn before the announcement of the sentence, in which event the proceedings shall continue as though the accused had pleaded not guilty.

(a)  At any time after charges have been signed, as provided in Section [432.051](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=432.051), a party may take oral or written depositions unless the military judge, a court-martial without a military judge hearing the case, or, if the case is not being heard, an authority competent to convene a court-martial for the trial of those charges forbids it for good cause.  If a deposition is to be taken before charges are referred for trial, the authority may designate commissioned officers to represent the prosecution and the defense and may authorize those officers to take the deposition of any witness.
    
    (b)  The party at whose instance a deposition is to be taken shall give to every other party reasonable written notice of the time and place for taking the deposition.

    (1)  the witness resides or is beyond the state in which the court-martial or court of inquiry is ordered to sit, or more than 100 miles from the place of trial or hearing;
    
    (2)  the witness because of death, age, sickness, bodily infirmity, imprisonment, military necessity, nonamenability to process, or other reasonable cause, is unable or refuses to appear and testify in person at the place of trial or hearing;  or
    
    (3)  the present location of the witness is unknown.

    Sec. 432.075.  ADMISSIBILITY OF RECORDS OF COURTS OF INQUIRY.

    (b)  The testimony may be read in evidence only by the defense in cases extending to the dismissal of a commissioned officer.
    
    (c)  The testimony may also be read in evidence before a court of inquiry or a military board.

    Sec. 432.076.  VOTING AND RULINGS.  (a)  Voting by members of a general or special court-martial on the findings or sentence, and by members of a court-martial without a military judge upon questions of challenge, must be by secret written ballot.  The junior member of the court shall count the votes.  The count shall be checked by the president, who shall immediately announce the result of the ballot to the members of the court.
    
    (b)  The military judge and, except for questions of challenge, the president of a court-martial without a military judge shall rule on all questions of law and interlocutory questions arising during the proceedings.  A ruling made by the military judge on a question of law or interlocutory question other than the factual issue of mental responsibility of the accused, or by the president of a court-martial without a military judge on a question of law other than a motion for a finding of not guilty, is final and constitutes the ruling of the court.  However, the military judge or the president of a court-martial without a military judge may change the ruling at any time during the trial.  Unless the ruling is final, if a member objects to it the court shall be cleared and closed and the question decided by a voice vote as provided by Section [432.077](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=432.077) beginning with the junior in rank.
    
    (c)  Before a vote is taken on the findings, the military judge or the president of a court-martial without a military judge, in the presence of the accused and counsel, shall instruct the members of the court as to the elements of the offense and charge them that:
    
    (1)  the accused must be presumed to be innocent until his guilt is established by legal and competent evidence beyond reasonable doubt;
    
    (2)  in the case being considered, if there is a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, the doubt must be resolved in favor of the accused and he must be acquitted;
    
    (3)  if there is a reasonable doubt as to the degree of guilt, the finding must be in a lower degree as to which there is not a reasonable doubt;  and
    
    (4)  the burden of proof of establishing the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt is on the state.
    
    (d)  Subsections (a), (b), and (c) do not apply to a court-martial composed of a military judge only.  The military judge of such a court-martial shall determine all questions of law and fact arising during the proceedings and, if the accused is convicted, adjudge an appropriate sentence.  The military judge of such a court-martial shall make a general finding and shall on request find the facts specially.  If an opinion or memorandum of decision is filed, it is sufficient if the findings of fact appear in that document.

    Sec. 432.077.  NUMBER OF VOTES REQUIRED.  (a)  A person may be convicted of an offense only by the concurrence of two-thirds of the members present when the vote is taken.
    
    (b)  All sentences shall be determined by the concurrence of two-thirds of the members present at the time the vote is taken.
    
    (c)  All other questions to be decided by the members of a general or special court-martial shall be determined by a majority vote.  A tie vote on a challenge disqualifies the member challenged, but a determination to reconsider a finding of guilty or to reconsider a sentence for the purpose of reducing it may be made by a lesser vote that indicates that the reconsideration is not opposed by the number of votes required for that finding or sentence.  A tie vote on a motion for a finding of not guilty or on a motion relating to the question of the accused's sanity is a determination against the accused.  A tie vote on any other question is a determination in favor of the accused.

    Sec. 432.079.  RECORD OF TRIAL.  (a)  Each general court-martial shall keep a separate record of the proceedings of the trial of each case brought before it.  The record must be authenticated by the signature of the military judge.  If the record cannot be authenticated by the military judge because of the judge's death, disability, or absence, it must be authenticated by the signature of the trial counsel or by that of a member if the trial counsel is unable to authenticate it because of the counsel's death, disability, or absence.  In a court-martial consisting of only a military judge, the record must be authenticated by the court reporter under the same conditions that would impose that duty on a member under this subsection.  If the proceedings have resulted in an acquittal of all charges and specifications or, if not affecting a general or flag officer, in a sentence not including discharge and not in excess of that which may otherwise be adjudged by a special court-martial, the record must contain the matters prescribed by regulations of the governor.
    
    (b)  Each special and summary court-martial shall keep a separate record of the proceedings in each case, and the record must contain the matter and be authenticated in the manner prescribed by regulations of the governor.
    
    (c)  A copy of the record of the proceedings of each general and special court-martial shall be given to the accused as soon as it is authenticated.

A forfeiture may not extend to pay or allowances accrued before that date.
    
    (b)  A period of confinement included in a sentence of a court-martial begins to run from the date the sentence is adjudged by the court-martial, but periods during which the sentence to confinement is suspended or deferred are excluded in computing the service of the term of confinement.
    
    (c)  On application by an accused who is under sentence to confinement that has not been ordered executed, the convening authority or, if the accused is no longer under the convening authority's jurisdiction, the officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the command to which the accused is currently assigned, may in his sole discretion defer service of the sentence.  The deferment shall terminate when the sentence is ordered executed.  The deferment may be rescinded at any time by the officer who granted it or, if the accused is no longer under that officer's jurisdiction, by the officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the command to which the accused is currently assigned.

Persons confined in a jail, penitentiary, or prison are subject to the same discipline and treatment as persons confined or committed to the jail, penitentiary, or prison by the courts of the state or of a political subdivision of the state.
    
    (b)  The omission of the words "hard labor" from a sentence or punishment of a court-martial adjudging confinement does not deprive the authority executing that sentence or punishment of the power to require hard labor as a part of the punishment.
    
    (c)  The keepers, officers, and wardens of city or county jails and other jails, penitentiaries, or prisons designated by the governor or by a person authorized by the governor to act under Section [432.011](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=432.011), shall receive persons ordered into confinement before trial and persons committed to confinement by a military court and shall confine them according to law.

(a)  If charges against a person in the military service of this state are made or referred to a convening authority authorized to convene a court-martial for the trial of the person, and a convening authority, believing that the charges can be sustained and that the person charged will not appear for trial or intends to flee from justice, may issue a warrant of arrest to the sheriff or any constable of the county in which the person charged resides, or in which he is supposed to be, commanding the sheriff or constable to take the body of the charged person and confine him in jail until his case is finally disposed of.  The sheriff or constable, on the order of the convening authority, shall bring the charged person before the court-martial for trial, or turn him over to whoever the order may direct.  The convening authority issuing the warrant of arrest shall endorse on it the amount of bail to be required.  It is a violation of duty on the part of a sheriff or constable to permit a committed person to remain out of jail, except that the sheriff or constable may, if the person desires it, permit the person to give bail in the sum endorsed on the warrant, conditioned for his appearance, from time to time, before the court-martial as he may be ordered for trial and until his case is finally disposed of or until he surrenders to the sheriff or constable as directed by the convening authority of the court-martial before which he may be ordered for trial.
    
    (b)  On the failure of any person who has been admitted to bail conditioned for his appearance for trial before a court-martial, or on failure of any person admitted to bail to appear as a witness in any case before a court-martial, as conditioned in the bail bond of the person, the court-martial shall certify the fact of the failure to appear to the convening authority, or to the officer commanding for the time being, as the case may be.  The officer shall cause a judge advocate or district or county attorney to file suit in Travis County for the bail.
