    Sec. 311.025.  IRRECONCILABLE STATUTES AND AMENDMENTS.  (a)  Except as provided by Section [311.031](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=311.031)(d), if statutes enacted at the same or different sessions of the legislature are irreconcilable, the statute latest in date of enactment prevails.
    
    (b)  Except as provided by Section [311.031](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=311.031)(d), if amendments to the same statute are enacted at the same session of the legislature, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments shall be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the amendments are irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment prevails.
    
    (c)  In determining whether amendments are irreconcilable, text that is reenacted because of the requirement of Article III, Section [36](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=3.36), of the Texas Constitution is not considered to be irreconcilable with additions or omissions in the same text made by another amendment.  Unless clearly indicated to the contrary, an amendment that reenacts text in compliance with that constitutional requirement does not indicate legislative intent that the reenacted text prevail over changes in the same text made by another amendment, regardless of the relative dates of enactment.
    
    (d)  In this section, the date of enactment is the date on which the last legislative vote is taken on the bill enacting the statute.

    (1)  the date on which the last presiding officer signed the bill;
    
    (2)  the date on which the governor signed the bill;  or
    
    (3)  the date on which the bill became law by operation of law.

    Sec. 311.026.  SPECIAL OR LOCAL PROVISION PREVAILS OVER GENERAL.  (a)  If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision, the provisions shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.

    Sec. 311.031.  SAVING PROVISIONS.  (a)  Except as provided by Subsection (b), the reenactment, revision, amendment, or repeal of a statute does not affect:
    
    (1)  the prior operation of the statute or any prior action taken under it;
    
    (2)  any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation, or liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded, or incurred under it;
    
    (3)  any violation of the statute or any penalty, forfeiture, or punishment incurred under the statute before its amendment or repeal;  or
    
    (4)  any investigation, proceeding, or remedy concerning any privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture, or punishment;  and the investigation, proceeding, or remedy may be instituted, continued, or enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture, or punishment imposed, as if the statute had not been repealed or amended.
    
    (b)  If the penalty, forfeiture, or punishment for any offense is reduced by a reenactment, revision, or amendment of a statute, the penalty, forfeiture, or punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the statute as amended.
    
    (c)  The repeal of a statute by a code does not affect an amendment, revision, or reenactment of the statute by the same legislature that enacted the code.  The amendment, revision, or reenactment is preserved and given effect as part of the code provision that revised the statute so amended, revised, or reenacted.
    
    (d)  If any provision of a code conflicts with a statute enacted by the same legislature that enacted the code, the statute controls.

    (b)  If any statute contains a provision for nonseverability, that provision prevails in interpreting that statute.
    
    (c)  In a statute that does not contain a provision for severability or nonseverability, if any provision of the statute or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of the statute that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of the statute are severable.
    
    
    
    
    Acts 1985, 69th Leg., ch. 479, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1985.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 311.034.  WAIVER OF SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY.  In order to preserve the legislature's interest in managing state fiscal matters through the appropriations process, a statute shall not be construed as a waiver of sovereign immunity unless the waiver is effected by clear and unambiguous language.  In a statute, the use of "person," as defined by Section [311.005](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=311.005) to include governmental entities, does not indicate legislative intent to waive sovereign immunity unless the context of the statute indicates no other reasonable construction.  Statutory prerequisites to a suit, including the provision of notice, are jurisdictional requirements in all suits against a governmental entity.

    (b)  Except as provided by Subsection (c), a statute or rule that creates or defines a criminal offense or penalty shall be construed in favor of the actor if any part of the statute or rule is ambiguous on its face or as applied to the case, including:
    
    (1)  an element of offense; or
    
    (2)  the penalty to be imposed.
    
    (c)  Subsection (b) does not apply to a criminal offense or penalty under the Penal Code or under the Texas Controlled Substances Act.

    Sec. 311.036.  CONSTRUCTION OF ABORTION STATUTES.

    (b)  A statute may not be construed to restrict a political subdivision from regulating or prohibiting abortion in a manner that is at least as stringent as the laws of this state unless the statute explicitly states that political subdivisions are prohibited from regulating or prohibiting abortion in the manner described by the statute.
    
    (c)  Every statute that regulates or prohibits abortion is severable in each of its applications to every person and circumstance.  If any statute that regulates or prohibits abortion is found by any court to be unconstitutional, either on its face or as applied, then all applications of that statute that do not violate the United States Constitution and Texas Constitution shall be severed from the unconstitutional applications and shall remain enforceable, notwithstanding any other law, and the statute shall be interpreted as if containing language limiting the statute's application to the persons, group of persons, or circumstances for which the statute's application will not violate the United States Constitution and Texas Constitution.
