    (b)  The board shall adopt criteria to determine the suitability of candidates for participation in the program.  The department and the Department of State Health Services shall jointly develop methods of screening and assessing defendants required to participate in the program under Article [42A.303](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=42A.303), Code of Criminal Procedure, to determine their need for specific types of treatment for alcohol or drug abuse problems.

The department shall establish a graded system of rewards and sanctions for defendants who participate in the program, but a defendant required to participate in the program under Article [42A.303](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=42A.303), Code of Criminal Procedure, is not entitled to earn awards of time for good conduct.  A qualified professional, at least every 60 days, must perform an evaluation on a defendant that determines the defendant's treatment progress and institutional behavior. Not later than three days after the date on which a four-month evaluation is performed, the qualified professional shall establish a tentative release date for the defendant, notify the sentencing court of that fact, and include with the notice a copy of the four-month evaluation. The qualified professional immediately shall notify the court if the professional determines the defendant's conduct requires a revision of the tentative release date.
    
    (e)  The department shall employ or contract with qualified professionals to implement the program for persons required to participate in the program under Article [42A.303](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=42A.303), Code of Criminal Procedure.

    (2)  If the qualified professional with primary responsibility for treating a defendant and the individual in charge of security in the facility in which the defendant is housed jointly determine that the defendant is not complying with the rules or is medically or psychologically unsuitable for the program, they shall notify the department of that fact.
    
    (3)  The department, immediately on receiving notice, shall request the sentencing court to reassume custody of the defendant if the defendant was required to participate in the program under Article [42A.303](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=42A.303), Code of Criminal Procedure, or required to participate in the program following modification of community supervision. The court shall reassume custody before the 12th day after the date on which the department notifies the court.  If the court revokes the defendant's community supervision, the admission of the defendant to the institutional division is an admission for which the department must account in the scheduled admissions policy established under Section [499.071](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=499.071).
    
    (4)  The department, immediately on receiving notice, shall request the pardons and paroles division to reassume custody of the defendant if the defendant was required to participate in the program following modification of parole.  The pardons and paroles division shall immediately take action in accordance with established policies and procedures of the Board of Pardons and Paroles to remove the defendant from the program.  If a parole panel revokes the defendant's parole, the admission of the defendant to the institutional division is an admission for which the department must account in the scheduled admissions policy established under Section [499.071](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=499.071).
    
    (5)  If the defendant was transferred to the facility from a county jail under Subsection (l), the department shall return the defendant to the county jail.
    
    (6)  A court's recommendation that a defendant be placed in a program created under this section does not give the court the power to hold the department or any officer or employee of the department in contempt of court for failure to adhere to that recommendation.
    
    (g)  The department shall provide beds for the purpose of operating the program for persons required to participate in the program under Article [42A.303](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=42A.303), Code of Criminal Procedure, except that the beds may also be used to house the following categories of persons:
    
    (1)  persons transferred under Subchapter A, Chapter 499, and Section 508.118;
    
    (2)  persons whose community supervision or parole has been modified;
    
    (3)  defendants confined in county jails awaiting transfer to the institutional division; and
    
    (4)  inmates participating in the program described by Section [501.0931](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=501.0931).

    (i)  Repealed by Acts 2013, 83rd Leg., R.S., Ch. 1154, Sec. 29(1), eff. September 1, 2013.
    
    (j)  The department shall recover from a program participant the cost to the department of providing treatment, to the extent the participant has insurance that covers the treatment or is otherwise able to pay for the treatment.
    
    (k)  It is the intent of the legislature that facilities established under this section be used primarily to house persons required to participate in the program under Article [42A.303](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=42A.303), Code of Criminal Procedure, except that if treatment beds are empty, this subsection does not prohibit the department from using those empty beds to treat the categories of persons listed in Subsection (g).
    
    (l)  The department shall identify defendants confined in county jails who are awaiting transfer to the institutional division and who because of their need for treatment of drug or alcohol problems require transfer to a substance abuse felony punishment facility.  The department shall provide for the transportation of the defendant to such a facility.  If the board finds that a county has failed to fully cooperate with the department in evaluating defendants under this section, the board shall notify the Commission on Jail Standards of that fact.
