The board also shall provide notice by mail of its meetings to each member of the Legislature.  The notice of the meeting must include a description of the nature of the proposal or order to be considered.  If the agenda includes a public hearing on a proposal, the notice must so state.
    
    After a hearing and at a meeting held not less than 10 days after the date notice of the meeting was given in the manner provided for regular board meetings, in response to a governor's proposal the board, subject to the restrictions provided by Subsection (e), may:

    (2)  reject the proposal;  or

    (f)  The governor or board may adopt an order under this section withholding or transferring any portion of the total amount appropriated to finance the foundation school program for a fiscal year.

The governor or board may transfer an amount to the total amount appropriated to finance the foundation school program for a fiscal year and may increase the basic allotment.  The governor or board may adjust allocations of amounts between particular programs or statutory allotments under the foundation school program only for the purpose of conforming the allocations to actual pupil enrollments or attendance.
    
    (g)  The affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the board from each house is necessary for the adoption of an order by the board under this section.
    
    (h)  If either the governor or the board adopts an order under this section, the entity adopting the order shall notify the proposing entity, the comptroller, and the affected state agencies.  Unless the order is a contingent order, the entity adopting the order shall file a copy of the order with the secretary of state for publication in the Texas Register.
