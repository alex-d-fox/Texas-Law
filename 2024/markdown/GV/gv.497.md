The purchase of articles or products not included in an established contract and that do not exceed the dollar limits established under Section [2155.132](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2155.132) may be acquired directly from the office on the agency's obtaining an informal or a formal quotation for the item and issuing a proper purchase order to the office.  The comptroller and the department shall enter into an agreement to expedite the process by which agencies are required to requisition purchases of articles or products through the comptroller.

An agency may decline to purchase goods or articles from the office if the agency determines, after giving the office a final opportunity to negotiate on price, and the comptroller certifies, that the goods or articles can be purchased elsewhere at a lower price.
