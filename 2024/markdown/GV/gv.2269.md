    Sec. 2269.364.  STIPEND AMOUNT FOR UNSUCCESSFUL OFFERORS.  (a)  Unless a stipend is paid under Subsection (c), the design-build firm retains all rights to the work product submitted in a proposal.  The governmental entity may not release or disclose to any person, including the successful offeror, the work product contained in an unsuccessful proposal.  The governmental entity shall return all copies of the proposal and other information submitted to an unsuccessful offeror.  The governmental entity or its agents may not make use of any unique or nonordinary design element, technique, method, or process contained in the unsuccessful proposal that was not also contained in the successful proposal at the time of the original submittal, unless the entity acquires a license from the unsuccessful offeror.
    
    (b)  A violation of this section voids the contract for the project entered into by the governmental entity.  The governmental entity is liable to any unsuccessful offeror, or any member of the design-build team or its assignee, for one-half of the cost savings associated with the unauthorized use of the work product of the unsuccessful offeror.  Any interested party may bring an action for an injunction, declaratory relief, or damages for a violation of this section.

The stipend must be one-half of one percent of the contract amount and must be specified in the initial request for proposals.  If the offer is accepted and paid, the governmental entity may make use of any work product contained in the proposal, including the techniques, methods, processes, and information contained in the proposal.  The use by the governmental entity of any design element contained in an unsuccessful proposal is at the sole risk and discretion of the entity and does not confer liability on the recipient of the stipend under this subsection.
    
    (d)  Notwithstanding other law, including Chapter [552](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552), work product contained in an unsuccessful proposal submitted and rejected under this subchapter is confidential and may not be released unless a stipend offer has been accepted and paid as provided by Subsection (c).
