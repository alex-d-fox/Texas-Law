    Sec. 498.002.  CLASSIFICATION AND RECLASSIFICATION.  The department shall classify each inmate as soon as practicable on the inmate's arrival at the institutional division and, subject to the requirements of Section [498.005](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=498.005), shall reclassify the inmate as circumstances warrant.

The department shall maintain a record on each inmate showing each classification and reclassification of the inmate with the date and reason for each classification or reclassification.  The department may classify each inmate on the inmate's arrival at the institutional division in a time-earning category that does not allow the inmate to earn more than 30 days' good conduct time for each 30 days actually served.

Amended by Acts 1991, 72nd Leg., 2nd C.S., ch. 10, Sec. 11.03, eff. Aug. 29, 1991;  Acts 1995, 74th Leg., ch. 249, Sec. 2, eff. Sept. 1, 1995;  Acts 1995, 74th Leg., ch. 321, Sec. 1.047, eff.

    Amended by: 
    
    Acts 2021, 87th Leg., R.S., Ch. 126 (H.B. [719](http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/87R/billtext/html/HB00719F.HTM)), Sec. 2, eff. September 1, 2021.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 498.003.  ACCRUAL OF GOOD CONDUCT TIME.  (a)  Good conduct time applies only to eligibility for parole or mandatory supervision as provided by Section [508.145](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=508.145) or [508.147](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=508.147) and does not otherwise affect an inmate's term.  Good conduct time is a privilege and not a right.  Regardless of the classification of an inmate, the department may grant good conduct time to the inmate only if the department finds that the inmate is actively engaged in an agricultural, vocational, or educational endeavor, in an industrial program or other work program, or in a treatment program, unless the department finds that the inmate is not capable of participating in such a program or endeavor.
    
    (b)  An inmate accrues good conduct time according to the inmate's classification in amounts as follows:
    
    (1)  20 days for each 30 days actually served while the inmate is classified as a trusty, except that the department may award the inmate not more than 10 extra days for each 30 days actually served;
    
    (2)  20 days for each 30 days actually served while the inmate is classified as a Class I inmate;  and
    
    (3)  10 days for each 30 days actually served while the inmate is classified as a Class II inmate.
    
    (c)  An inmate may not accrue good conduct time during any period the inmate is classified as a Class III inmate or is on parole or under mandatory supervision.
    
    (d)  An inmate may accrue good conduct time, in an amount determined by the department that does not exceed 15 days for each 30 days actually served, for diligent participation in an industrial program or other work program or for participation in an agricultural, educational, or vocational program provided to inmates by the department.  For the purposes of this subsection, the term "participation in an educational program" includes the participation of the inmate as a tutor or a pupil in a literacy program authorized by Section [501.005](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=501.005).  The department may not award good conduct time under this subsection for participation in a literacy program unless the department determines that the inmate participated in good faith and with diligence as a tutor or pupil.
    
    (e)  If a person is confined in a county jail, the department shall award good conduct time to the person up to an amount equal to the amount earned by an inmate in the entry level time earning class.  The department shall award good conduct time to a defendant for diligent participation in a voluntary work program operated by a sheriff under Article [43.101](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=43.101), Code of Criminal Procedure, in the same manner as if the inmate had diligently participated in an industrial program or other work program provided to inmates by the department.  The sheriff of each county shall have attached a certification of the number of days each inmate diligently participated in the volunteer work program operated by the sheriff under Article [43.101](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=43.101), Code of Criminal Procedure.

    Sec. 498.004.  FORFEITURE AND RESTORATION OF GOOD CONDUCT TIME.  (a)  If, during the actual term of imprisonment of an inmate in the department, the inmate commits an offense or violates a rule of the department, the department may forfeit all or any part of the inmate's accrued good conduct time or, in accordance with the policy adopted under Subsection (c), place all or any part of the inmate's accrued good conduct time in suspension.  The department may not restore good conduct time forfeited under this subsection but may reinstate good conduct time suspended under this subsection.

    (b)  On the revocation of parole or mandatory supervision of an inmate, the inmate forfeits all good conduct time previously accrued.

    (b)  On the revocation of parole or mandatory supervision of an inmate, the inmate forfeits all good conduct time previously accrued.  On return to the institutional division the inmate may accrue new good conduct time for subsequent time served in the division.  The department may restore good conduct time forfeited on a revocation that does not involve a new criminal conviction after the inmate has served at least three months of good behavior in the institutional division, subject to policies established by the division. 
    
    (c)  The department shall establish a policy regarding the suspension of good conduct time under Subsection (a).  The policy must provide that:
    
    (1)  the department will consider the severity of an inmate's offense or violation in determining whether to suspend all or part of the inmate's good conduct time instead of forfeiting the inmate's good conduct time;
    
    (2)  during any period of suspension, good conduct time placed in suspension may not be used:
    
    (A)  for purposes of granting privileges to an inmate; or
    
    (B)  to compute an inmate's eligibility for parole under Section [508.145](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=508.145) or to determine an inmate's date of release to mandatory supervision under Section [508.147](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=508.147);
    
    (3)  at the conclusion of any period of suspension, the department may forfeit or reinstate the good conduct time placed in suspension based on the inmate's conduct during the period of the suspension;  and
    
    (4)  in determining whether to forfeit or reinstate good conduct time placed in suspension, the department must consider whether any impact to public safety is likely to result from the inmate's release on parole or to mandatory supervision if the good conduct time is reinstated.
