For purposes of the investment authority of the board of trustees under Section [67](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=16.67), Article XVI, Texas Constitution, "securities" includes any investment instrument within the meaning of the term as defined by Section [4001.068](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=4001.068), 15 U.S.C.

    Sec. 825.403.  COLLECTION OF MEMBER'S CONTRIBUTIONS.  (a)  Each payroll period, each employer shall deduct from the compensation of each member employed by the employer the amount required by Section [825.402](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=825.402).
    
    (b)  Each employer or the employer's designated disbursing officer, at a time and in a form prescribed by the retirement system, shall send to the executive director all deductions and a certification of earnings of each member employed by the employer.  An employer shall use electronic fund transfer to send deductions required by this section or shall certify to the retirement system either that the employer is unable to establish a qualifying account at a financial institution or that payment by electronic fund transfer would be impractical or more costly than payment by paper check.
    
    (c)  The executive director shall deposit with the comptroller all deductions received by the executive director.
    
    (d)  After the deductions are deposited with the comptroller, the money shall be used as provided by this subtitle.
    
    (e)  The county superintendent or ex officio county superintendent, in accordance with this section, shall collect contributions of members employed in common school or other school districts under the superintendent's jurisdiction.
    
    (f)  Employers shall make the deductions required by this section even if the member's compensation is reduced below the amount equal to the minimum compensation provided by law.
    
    (g)  By becoming a member of the retirement system, a member consents to the deductions required by this section.  The payment of compensation less those deductions is a complete release of all claims, except benefits provided by this subtitle, for services rendered by the member during the payment period.
    
    (h)  If deductions were previously required but not paid, the retirement system may not provide benefits based on the service or compensation unless the deposits required by this section have been fully paid.  The person's employer at the time the unreported service was rendered or compensation was paid must verify the service or compensation as required by Subsection (j) and the person must submit the verification to the retirement system not later than five years after the end of the school year in which the service was rendered or compensation was paid.  To establish the service or compensation credit, the person must deposit with the retirement system the actuarial present value, at the time of deposit, of the additional standard retirement annuity benefits that would be attributable to the purchase of service or compensation credit under this section, based on rates and tables recommended by the retirement system's actuary and adopted by the board of trustees.  The board of trustees shall:
    
    (1)  prescribe terms for payments under this subsection; and
    
    (2)  credit the person for prior service to which the person is entitled under this subtitle.
    
    (i)  Contributions required by Section [825.402](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=825.402) shall be deducted from the funds regularly appropriated by the state for the current maintenance of any educational institution supported in whole or part by the state and not otherwise covered by this section.
    
    (j)  If deductions were previously required but not paid, proof of service satisfactory to the retirement system must be made before service credit is granted or payment for the credit is required.  Proof of service is sufficient if the person's employer documents that the employer has records made at or near the time of service that establish the amount of time worked and salary earned.  An affidavit based on memory without written records made at or near the time of service is not sufficient documentation for the establishment of service credit.  The retirement system may audit records used for documentation under this subsection.  A person who does not obtain proof of service as required by this section may not establish the service or compensation credit.
    
    (k)  Reporting entities and the commissioner of education shall inform the retirement system of changes in status of a school district or charter school that affect the reporting responsibilities of the entity.
    
    (l)  The commissioner of education shall notify the retirement system in writing:
    
    (1)  of the revocation, denial of renewal, or surrender of a charter issued by the State Board of Education, within 10 business days of the date of the event;
    
    (2)  that an open-enrollment charter school or other reporting entity no longer is receiving state funds, within 10 business days of the date on which funding ceases; and
    
    (3)  when an open-enrollment charter school or other reporting entity resumes receiving state funds, within 10 business days of the date on which funding resumes.

Employers shall pay to the retirement system the picked-up contributions from the same source of funds that is used in paying earnings to the employees.  Such payments shall be in lieu of contributions by the employees.  An employer shall pick up these contributions by a corresponding reduction in the cash salary of the employees, by an offset against a future salary increase, or by a combination of a salary reduction and offset against a future salary increase.  Employees do not have the option of choosing to receive the contributed amounts directly instead of having them paid by the employer to the retirement system.
    
    (b)  Contributions picked up as provided by Subsection (a) shall be treated as employer contributions in determining tax treatment of the amounts under the United States Internal Revenue Code;  however, each employer shall continue to withhold federal income taxes on these picked-up contributions until the Internal Revenue Service determines or the federal courts rule that pursuant to Section 414(h) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. Section 414) these picked-up contributions may not be included as gross income of the employee until such time as they are distributed or made available.

    Sec. 825.4092.  EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS FOR EMPLOYED RETIREES.  (a)  This section applies to an employer who reports to the retirement system the employment of a retiree.
    
    (b)  Except as provided by Subsection (e), during each payroll period for which a retiree is reported, the employer shall contribute to the retirement system for each retiree reported an amount based on the retiree's salary equal to the sum of:
    
    (1)  the current contribution amount that would be contributed by the retiree if the retiree were an active, contributing member; and
    
    (2)  the current contribution amount authorized by the General Appropriations Act that the state would contribute for that retiree if the retiree were an active, contributing member.
    
    (c)  Except as provided by Subsection (e), each payroll period, for each retiree who is enrolled in the Texas Public School Employees Group Insurance Program under Chapter [1575](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1575), Insurance Code, the employer who reports the employment of a retiree shall contribute to the trust fund established under that chapter an amount established by the retirement system.  In determining the amount to be contributed by the employer under this subsection, the retirement system shall consider the amount a retiree is required to pay for the retiree and any enrolled dependents to participate in the group program and the cost of the retiree's and enrolled dependents' participation in the group program. If more than one employer reports the retiree to the retirement system during a month, the amount of the required payment shall be prorated among the employers.
    
    (d)  Contributions under this section are subject to the requirements of Section [825.408](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=825.408).

The employer may not directly or indirectly pass that cost on to the retiree through payroll deduction, by imposition of a fee, or by any other means designed to recover the cost.
    
    (g)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the amounts required to be paid under Subsections (b) and (c) are not required to be paid by a reporting employer for a retiree who retired from the retirement system on or after September 1, 2005, and is employed in a position described by Section [824.6021](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=824.6021)(a).

    Sec. 825.410.  PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS OR INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS FOR SPECIAL SERVICE CREDIT.  (a)  Payments to establish special service credit as authorized under this subtitle, other than service credit that may only be determined and paid for at the time of retirement such as unused leave as authorized by Section [823.403](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=823.403), may be made in a lump sum by a monthly payroll deduction in an amount not less than one-twelfth of the contribution required to establish at least one year of service credit, or in equal monthly installments over a period not to exceed the lesser of the number of years of credit to be purchased or 60 months.  Installment and payroll deduction payments are due on the first day of each calendar month in the payment period.  If an installment or payroll deduction payment is not made in full within 60 days after the due date, the retirement system may refund all installment or payroll deduction payments less fees paid on the lump sum due when installment or payroll deduction payments began.  Partial payment of an installment or payroll deduction payment may be treated as nonpayment.  A check returned for insufficient funds or a closed account shall be treated as nonpayment.  When two or more consecutive monthly payments have a returned check, a refund may be made. 
    
    (b)  Service credit shall be established pursuant to the following provisions:
    
    (1)  The retirement system shall credit a member's payments made under this section to a suspense account in the trust fund until the sum of the payments equals the amount required for one year of service credit, at which time the retirement system shall deposit the payments in the appropriate accounts in the trust fund and grant the applicable amount of service credit.  No credit shall be established for service pursuant to Section [823.501](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=823.501) until a lump sum has been paid or all payroll deduction or installment payments have been completed.
    
    (2)  No credit shall be established for other service when the cost of establishing the service has been determined by using withdrawn service to be reinstated pursuant to Section [823.501](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=823.501) until a lump sum or all payroll deductions or installments for the withdrawn service have been paid.
    
    (3)  All other service shall be credited when sufficient payroll deductions or installments have been completed to satisfy the cost requirements for a year of service.
    
    (c)  All installment and payroll deduction payments must be made on or before the service retirement date or the last day of the month in which the member's application for service retirement is submitted, whichever is later, or before the 31st day following the date on which the medical board certifies a member's disability.  The installment payment method or payroll deduction method may not be used to establish service credit after retirement.
    
    (d)  If a member who has made at least one payroll deduction or installment payment and who is using the payroll deduction or installment method of payment dies before completing the payments, the retirement system may:
    
    (1)  return to the beneficiary determined under Sections [824.101](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=824.101) and [824.103](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=824.103) the payments less fees paid on the lump sum due when payments began and less payments which have resulted in credited service being established;  or
    
    (2)  permit the beneficiary determined under Sections [824.101](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=824.101) and [824.103](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=824.103) to complete payment of the unpaid balance remaining at the time of the member's death.
    
    (e)  If the beneficiary requests a return of the installment or payroll deduction payments under Subsection (d)(1), the retirement system shall return the payments in a lump sum.  No additional service credit shall be established that has not been established in compliance with this section.  If service credit has been established by installment or payroll deduction payments, the retirement system shall not refund the payments, less any applicable fees, used to establish such credit unless a refund of total accumulated contributions is made to a member or beneficiary.
    
    (f)  If the beneficiary elects to complete the payments under Subsection (d)(2), the beneficiary shall make full payment in a lump sum of the unpaid balance before the issuance of any warrant to him in full or partial payment of death or survivor benefits.
    
    (g)  A member seeking to establish service credit by using the installment or payroll deduction payment method shall pay an additional fee of nine percent per annum calculated on a declining balance method on the lump sum due at the time the payment process begins.  For purposes of this subsection, the installment or payroll deduction payment process begins on the first business day of the month in which the first payment becomes due.  None of the additional fees shall be returned to the member or a beneficiary.
    
    (h)  The board of trustees has authority to adopt rules to implement this section, including rules establishing a minimum amount for monthly installment or payroll deduction payments and rules establishing payment under Section [823.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=823.004)(b).
    
    (i)  The actuary designated by the board of trustees shall, in investigating the experience of the members of the system, note any significant increase in the establishment of special service credit and determine the extent to which any increase has been caused by the installment or payroll deduction payment method.  If the actuary certifies in writing to the retirement system that sound actuarial funding of the retirement system's benefits is endangered by continuation of the installment or payroll deduction payment method, the board of trustees may determine that the payment method will not be available, other than to those who are using the method at the time of the determination.
    
    (j)  Payments to establish service credit by a member who plans to retire in less than a year may be made by payroll deduction for a period determined by the retirement system.
    
    (k)  Each employer shall establish a payroll deduction plan to facilitate the payroll deductions authorized by this section and shall cooperate with the retirement system in implementing the payroll deduction method of payment for service credit.

    Sec. 825.506.  PLAN QUALIFICATION.  (a)  It is intended that the provisions of this subtitle be construed and administered in a manner that the retirement system's benefit plan will be considered a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. Section 401).  Notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle, benefits provided to a retiree, or based on the service of a member or retiree, may not exceed benefits permitted to be provided by a qualified plan by Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. Section 415).  The board of trustees may adopt rules that modify the plan to the extent necessary for the retirement system to be a qualified plan and shall adopt rules to ensure that benefits paid to a retiree, or to a beneficiary of a member or retiree, do not exceed the limits provided by Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. Section 415).  Rules adopted by the board of trustees are to be considered a part of the plan.
    
    (b)  In determining qualification status under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. Section 401), the retirement system's benefit plan shall be considered primary.  An employer may not provide employee retirement or deferred benefits to the extent that, when considered together with the benefits authorized by this subtitle as required by federal law, would result in the retirement system's plan failing to meet federal qualification standards as applied to public pension plans.
    
    (c)  It is intended that the retirement system administer the plan in a manner that satisfies the required minimum distribution provisions of Section 401(a)(9), Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  The board of trustees may adopt rules to administer the distribution requirements, including distribution when a participant dies before the entire interest is distributed.

    Sec. 825.507.  RECORD CONFIDENTIALITY.  (a)  Records of a participant and information about the records of a participant that are in the custody of the retirement system or of an administrator, carrier, attorney, consultant, or governmental agency, including the comptroller, acting in cooperation with or on behalf of the retirement system are confidential and not subject to public disclosure.  Because the records and information described by this section are exempt from the public access provisions of Chapter [552](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552), the retirement system or an administering firm, carrier, attorney, consultant, or governmental agency, including the comptroller, acting in cooperation with or on behalf of the retirement system, is not required to accept or comply with a request for a record or information about a record or to seek an opinion from the attorney general, except as otherwise provided by this section.
    
    (b)  The retirement system may release records of a participant, or information about the records of a participant, including a participant to which Chapter [803](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=803) applies, to:
    
    (1)  the participant or the participant's attorney or guardian or another person who the executive director determines is acting on behalf of the participant;
    
    (2)  the executor or administrator of the deceased participant's estate, including information relating to the deceased participant's beneficiary, or if an executor or administrator of the deceased participant's estate has not been named, a person or entity who the executive director determines is acting in the interest of the deceased participant's estate, or an heir, legatee, or devisee of the deceased participant;
    
    (3)  a spouse or former spouse of the participant if the executive director determines that the information is relevant to the spouse's or former spouse's interest in member accounts, benefits, or other amounts payable by the retirement system;
    
    (4)  an administrator, carrier, consultant, attorney, or agent acting on behalf of the retirement system;
    
    (5)  a governmental entity, an employer, or the designated agent of an employer, only to the extent the retirement system needs to share the information to perform the purposes of the retirement system, as determined by the executive director;
    
    (6)  a person authorized by the participant in writing to receive the information;
    
    (7)  a federal, state, or local criminal law enforcement agency that requests a record for a law enforcement purpose;
    
    (8)  the attorney general to the extent necessary to enforce child support; or
    
    (9)  a party in response to a subpoena issued under applicable law if the executive director determines that the participant will have a reasonable opportunity to contest the subpoena.
    
    (c)  The records of a participant and information about the records remain confidential after release to a person as authorized by this section.  This section does not prevent the retirement system or administering firm or carrier acting in cooperation with or on behalf of the retirement system from disclosing or confirming, on an individual basis, the status or identity of a participant as a member, former member, retiree, deceased member or retiree, beneficiary, or alternate payee of the retirement system.
    
    (d)  The executive director may designate other employees of the retirement system to make the necessary determinations under this section.  A determination and disclosure under this section may be made without notice to the participant.
    
    (e)  The retirement system may make not more than two mailings a year on behalf of a nonprofit association of active or retired school employees, for purposes of association membership and research only, to persons identified in information contained in records that are in the custody of the retirement system.  The nonprofit association requesting a mailing shall pay the expenses of the mailing.
    
    (f)  This section does not authorize the retirement system to compile or disclose a list of participants' names, addresses, including e-mail addresses, or social security numbers unless the executive director determines that a compilation or disclosure is necessary to administer the retirement system.
    
    (g)  In this section, "participant" means a member, former member, retiree, annuitant, beneficiary, or alternate payee of the retirement system, or an employee or contractor of an employer covered by the retirement system for whom records were received by the retirement system for the purpose of administering the terms of the plan, including for audit or investigative purposes.

    Sec. 825.509.  DIRECT ROLLOVERS.  (a)  This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 1993.

    (B)  the portion of the distribution that is includable in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not includable in gross income; or

    (1)  an individual retirement account described by Section 408(a), Internal Revenue Code of 1986;
    
    (2)  an individual retirement annuity described by Section 408(b), Internal Revenue Code of 1986;

    (6)  with respect to a distribution made on or after January 1, 2002, an annuity contract described by Section 403(b), Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or
    
    (7)  with respect to a distribution made on or after January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA described by Section 408A, Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    
    (d)  In this section:
    
    (1)  "Direct rollover" means a payment by the retirement system to the eligible retirement plan specified by a distributee.

    (B)  is not the spouse, surviving spouse, or alternate payee of an employee or former employee.
    
    (e)  A direct trustee-to-trustee transfer on behalf of a distributee beneficiary who is not a spouse is an eligible rollover distribution.

    (1)  is established for the purpose of receiving the distribution; and
    
    (2)  is considered an inherited account or annuity to which Section 401(a)(9)(B), Internal Revenue Code of 1986, applies, except for Section 401(a)(9)(B)(iv).

    Sec. 825.517.  EXCESS BENEFIT ARRANGEMENT.  (a)  A separate, nonqualified, unfunded excess benefit arrangement is created outside the trust fund of the retirement system.  This excess benefit arrangement shall be administered as a governmental excess benefit arrangement under Section 415(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. Section 415(m)).  The purpose of the excess benefit arrangement is to pay to annuitants of the retirement system benefits otherwise payable by the retirement system that exceed the limitations on benefits imposed by Section 415(b)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. Section 415(b)(1)(A)).

    (d)  An annuitant is entitled to a monthly benefit under this section in an amount equal to the amount by which the benefit otherwise payable by the retirement system has been reduced by the limitation on benefits imposed by Section 415(b)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. Section 415(b)(1)(A)).  The benefit payable by this arrangement is payable at the times and in the form that the benefit payable under the trust fund is paid.
    
    (e)  The benefit payable under this section shall be paid from state contributions that otherwise would be made to the trust fund under Section [825.404](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=825.404).  In lieu of deposit in the state contribution account, an amount determined by the retirement system to be necessary to pay benefits under this section shall be paid monthly to the credit of a dedicated account in the general revenue fund maintained only for the excess benefit arrangement.  The account may include amounts needed to pay reasonable and necessary expenses of administering this arrangement.  The monthly amount to be paid to the credit of the account shall be transferred to the account at least 15 days before the date of a monthly disbursement under this section.
    
    (f)  The board of trustees may adopt rules governing the excess benefit arrangement that are necessary for the efficient administration of the arrangement in compliance with Section 415(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. Section 415(m)).
