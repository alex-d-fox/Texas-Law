    (d)  This subsection applies only if the services or resources are provided under a written contract or agreement.  The receiving agency shall reimburse the providing agency within 30 days after the date by which the services or resources are provided and an invoice is received.  If the receiving agency does not accept the services or resources or finds an error in the invoice, it shall notify the providing agency of the fact in writing as soon as possible within the 30-day period and make payment within 10 days after the date the agencies agree the problems are corrected or the error resolved.  If the agencies cannot agree on the amount of the reimbursement, the comptroller shall determine the appropriate amount.  If the receiving agency does not, within the 30-day period, reimburse the providing agency or give the providing agency written notice of a problem or error, the comptroller on request of the providing agency may transfer from amounts appropriated to the receiving agency the appropriate amount in accordance with this section.
