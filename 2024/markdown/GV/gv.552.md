    SUBCHAPTER A. GENERAL PROVISIONS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 552.001.  POLICY;  CONSTRUCTION.  (a)  Under the fundamental philosophy of the American constitutional form of representative government that adheres to the principle that government is the servant and not the master of the people, it is the policy of this state that each person is entitled, unless otherwise expressly provided by law, at all times to complete information about the affairs of government and the official acts of public officials and employees.  The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know.  The people insist on remaining informed so that they may retain control over the instruments they have created.  The provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed to implement this policy.
    
    (b)  This chapter shall be liberally construed in favor of granting a request for information.

The retirement system, administering firm, carrier, or governmental agency is not required to accept or comply with a request for a record or information about a record or to seek an opinion from the attorney general because the records are exempt from the provisions of this chapter, except as otherwise provided by this section.

    (f)  The records of an individual member, annuitant, retiree, beneficiary, alternate payee, program participant, or person eligible for benefits from the retirement system remain confidential after release to a person as authorized by this section. The records may become part of the public record of an administrative or judicial proceeding related to a contested case, and the member, annuitant, retiree, beneficiary, alternate payee, program participant, or person eligible for benefits waives the confidentiality of the records, including medical records, unless the records are closed to public access by a protective order issued under applicable law.
    
    (g)  The retirement system may require a person to provide the person's social security number as the system considers necessary to ensure the proper administration of all services, benefits, plans, and programs under the retirement system's administration, oversight, or participation or as otherwise required by state or federal law.
    
    (h)  The retirement system has sole discretion in determining whether a record is subject to this section.

    Sec. 552.008.  INFORMATION FOR LEGISLATIVE PURPOSES.  (a)  This chapter does not grant authority to withhold information from individual members, agencies, or committees of the legislature to use for legislative purposes.
    
    (b)  A governmental body on request by an individual member, agency, or committee of the legislature shall provide public information, including confidential information, to the requesting member, agency, or committee for inspection or duplication in accordance with this chapter if the requesting member, agency, or committee states that the public information is requested under this chapter for legislative purposes.  A governmental body, by providing public information under this section that is confidential or otherwise excepted from required disclosure under law, does not waive or affect the confidentiality of the information for purposes of state or federal law or waive the right to assert exceptions to required disclosure of the information in the future.  The governmental body may require the requesting individual member of the legislature, the requesting legislative agency or committee, or the members or employees of the requesting entity who will view or handle information that is received under this section and that is confidential under law to sign a confidentiality agreement that covers the information and requires that:
    
    (1)  the information not be disclosed outside the requesting entity, or within the requesting entity for purposes other than the purpose for which it was received;
    
    (2)  the information be labeled as confidential;
    
    (3)  the information be kept securely;  or
    
    (4)  the number of copies made of the information or the notes taken from the information that implicate the confidential nature of the information be controlled, with all copies or notes that are not destroyed or returned to the governmental body remaining confidential and subject to the confidentiality agreement.
    
    (b-1)  A member, committee, or agency of the legislature required by a governmental body to sign a confidentiality agreement under Subsection (b) may seek a decision as provided by Subsection (b-2) about whether the information covered by the confidentiality agreement is confidential under law.  A confidentiality agreement signed under Subsection (b) is void to the extent that the agreement covers information that is finally determined under Subsection (b-2) to not be confidential under law.
    
    (b-2)  The member, committee, or agency of the legislature may seek a decision from the attorney general about the matter.  The attorney general by rule shall establish procedures and deadlines for receiving information necessary to decide the matter and briefs from the requestor, the governmental body, and any other interested person.  The attorney general shall promptly render a decision requested under this subsection, determining whether the information covered by the confidentiality agreement is confidential under law, not later than the 45th business day after the date the attorney general received the request for a decision under this subsection.  The attorney general shall issue a written decision on the matter and provide a copy of the decision to the requestor, the governmental body, and any interested person who submitted necessary information or a brief to the attorney general about the matter.  The requestor or the governmental body may appeal a decision of the attorney general under this subsection to a Travis County district court.  A person may appeal a decision of the attorney general under this subsection to a Travis County district court if the person claims a proprietary interest in the information affected by the decision or a privacy interest in the information that a confidentiality law or judicial decision is designed to protect.
    
    (c)  This section does not affect:
    
    (1)  the right of an individual member, agency, or committee of the legislature to obtain information from a governmental body under other law, including under the rules of either house of the legislature;
    
    (2)  the procedures under which the information is obtained under other law;  or
    
    (3)  the use that may be made of the information obtained under other law.

    (b)  Each public official shall complete a course of training of not less than one and not more than two hours regarding the responsibilities of the governmental body with which the official serves and its officers and employees under this chapter not later than the 90th day after the date the public official:

    (c)  A public official may designate a public information coordinator to satisfy the training requirements of this section for the public official if the public information coordinator is primarily responsible for administering the responsibilities of the public official or governmental body under this chapter.  Designation of a public information coordinator under this subsection does not relieve a public official from the duty to comply with any other requirement of this chapter that applies to the public official.  The designated public information coordinator shall complete the training course regarding the responsibilities of the governmental body with which the coordinator serves and of its officers and employees under this chapter not later than the 90th day after the date the coordinator assumes the person's duties as coordinator.

    (2)  the applicability of this chapter to governmental bodies;
    
    (3)  procedures and requirements regarding complying with a request for information under this chapter;

    (5)  penalties and other consequences for failure to comply with this chapter.
    
    (e)  The office of the attorney general or other entity providing the training shall provide a certificate of course completion to persons who complete the training required by this section.  A governmental body shall maintain and make available for public inspection the record of its public officials' or, if applicable, the public information coordinator's completion of the training.
    
    (f)  Completing the required training as a public official of the governmental body satisfies the requirements of this section with regard to the public official's service on a committee or subcommittee of the governmental body and the public official's ex officio service on any other governmental body.
    
    (g)  The training required by this section may be used to satisfy any corresponding training requirements concerning this chapter or open records required by law for a public official or public information coordinator.  The attorney general shall attempt to coordinate the training required by this section with training required by other law to the extent practicable.
    
    (h)  A certificate of course completion is admissible as evidence in a criminal prosecution under this chapter.  However, evidence that a defendant completed a course of training offered under this section is not prima facie evidence that the defendant knowingly violated this chapter.

    Sec. 552.261.  CHARGE FOR PROVIDING COPIES OF PUBLIC INFORMATION.  (a)  The charge for providing a copy of public information shall be an amount that reasonably includes all costs related to reproducing the public information, including costs of materials, labor, and overhead.  If a request is for 50 or fewer pages of paper records, the charge for providing the copy of the public information may not include costs of materials, labor, or overhead, but shall be limited to the charge for each page of the paper record that is photocopied, unless the pages to be photocopied are located in:
    
    (1)  two or more separate buildings that are not physically connected with each other;  or
    
    (2)  a remote storage facility.
    
    (b)  If the charge for providing a copy of public information includes costs of labor, the requestor may require the governmental body's officer for public information or the officer's agent to provide the requestor with a written statement as to the amount of time that was required to produce and provide the copy.  The statement must be signed by the officer for public information or the officer's agent and the officer's or the agent's name must be typed or legibly printed below the signature.  A charge may not be imposed for providing the written statement to the requestor.
    
    (c)  For purposes of Subsection (a), a connection of two buildings by a covered or open sidewalk, an elevated or underground passageway, or a similar facility is insufficient to cause the buildings to be considered separate buildings.
    
    (d)  Charges for providing a copy of public information are considered to accrue at the time the governmental body advises the requestor that the copy is available on payment of the applicable charges.
    
    (e)  Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, all requests received in one calendar day from an individual may be treated as a single request for purposes of calculating costs under this chapter. A governmental body may not combine multiple requests under this subsection from separate individuals who submit requests on behalf of an organization.

(a)  If a request for a copy of public information will result in the imposition of a charge under this subchapter that exceeds $40, or a request to inspect a paper record will result in the imposition of a charge under Section [552.271](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552.271) that exceeds $40, the governmental body shall provide the requestor with a written itemized statement that details all estimated charges that will be imposed, including any allowable charges for labor or personnel costs.  If an alternative less costly method of viewing the records is available, the statement must include a notice that the requestor may contact the governmental body regarding the alternative method.  The governmental body must inform the requestor of the responsibilities imposed on the requestor by this section and of the rights granted by this entire section and give the requestor the information needed to respond, including:

    (3)  the requestor has sent to the attorney general a complaint alleging that the requestor has been overcharged for being provided with a copy of the public information.
    
    (c)  If the governmental body later determines, but before it makes the copy or the paper record available, that the estimated charges will exceed the charges detailed in the written itemized statement by 20 percent or more, the governmental body shall send to the requestor a written updated itemized statement that details all estimated charges that will be imposed, including any allowable charges for labor or personnel costs.  If the requestor does not respond in writing to the updated estimate in the time and manner described by Subsection (b), the request is considered to have been withdrawn by the requestor.
    
    (d)  If the actual charges that a governmental body imposes for a copy of public information, or for inspecting a paper record under Section [552.271](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552.271), exceeds $40, the charges may not exceed:
    
    (1)  the amount estimated in the updated itemized statement;  or
    
    (2)  if an updated itemized statement is not sent to the requestor, an amount that exceeds by 20 percent or more the amount estimated in the itemized statement.

    (f)  A requestor is considered to have responded to the itemized statement or the updated itemized statement on the date that:
    
    (1)  the response is delivered to the governmental body in person;
    
    (2)  the requestor deposits the properly addressed response in the United States mail;  or

    Sec. 552.262.  RULES OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.  (a)  The attorney general shall adopt rules for use by each governmental body in determining charges for providing copies of public information under this subchapter and in determining the charge, deposit, or bond required for making public information that exists in a paper record available for inspection as authorized by Sections [552.271](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552.271)(c) and (d).  The rules adopted by the attorney general shall be used by each governmental body in determining charges for providing copies of public information and in determining the charge, deposit, or bond required for making public information that exists in a paper record available for inspection, except to the extent that other law provides for charges for specific kinds of public information.  The charges for providing copies of public information may not be excessive and may not exceed the actual cost of producing the information or for making public information that exists in a paper record available for inspection.  A governmental body, other than an agency of state government, may determine its own charges for providing copies of public information and its own charge, deposit, or bond for making public information that exists in a paper record available for inspection but may not charge an amount that is greater than 25 percent more than the amount established by the attorney general unless the governmental body requests an exemption under Subsection (c).
    
    (b)  The rules of the attorney general shall prescribe the methods for computing the charges for providing copies of public information in paper, electronic, and other kinds of media and the charge, deposit, or bond required for making public information that exists in a paper record available for inspection.  The rules shall establish costs for various components of charges for providing copies of public information that shall be used by each governmental body in providing copies of public information or making public information that exists in a paper record available for inspection.
    
    (c)  A governmental body may request that it be exempt from part or all of the rules adopted by the attorney general for determining charges for providing copies of public information or the charge, deposit, or bond required for making public information that exists in a paper record available for inspection.  The request must be made in writing to the attorney general and must state the reason for the exemption.  If the attorney general determines that good cause exists for exempting a governmental body from a part or all of the rules, the attorney general shall give written notice of the determination to the governmental body within 90 days of the request.  On receipt of the determination, the governmental body may amend its charges for providing copies of public information or its charge, deposit, or bond required for making public information that exists in a paper record available for inspection according to the determination of the attorney general.
    
    (d)  The attorney general shall publish annually in the Texas Register a list of the governmental bodies that have authorization from the attorney general to adopt any modified rules for determining the cost of providing copies of public information or making public information that exists in a paper record available for inspection.
    
    (e)  The rules of the attorney general do not apply to a state governmental body that is not a state agency for purposes of Subtitle D, Title 10.

The officer for public information or the officer's agent may not seek payment of those unpaid amounts through any other means.
    
    (d)  The governmental body must fully document the existence and amount of those unpaid amounts or the amount of any anticipated costs, as applicable, before requiring a deposit or bond under this section.  The documentation is subject to required public disclosure under this chapter.
    
    (e)  For purposes of Subchapters F and G, a request for a copy of public information is considered to have been received by a governmental body on the date the governmental body receives the deposit or bond for payment of anticipated costs or unpaid amounts if the governmental body's officer for public information or the officer's agent requires a deposit or bond in accordance with this section.
    
    (e-1)  If a requestor modifies the request in response to the requirement of a deposit or bond authorized by this section, the modified request is considered a separate request for the purposes of this chapter and is considered received on the date the governmental body receives the written modified request.
    
    (f)  A requestor who fails to make a deposit or post a bond required under Subsection (a) before the 10th business day after the date the deposit or bond is required is considered to have withdrawn the request for the copy of the public information that precipitated the requirement of the deposit or bond.

(a)  A governmental body may establish reasonable monthly and yearly limits on the amount of time that personnel of the governmental body are required to spend producing public information for inspection or duplication by a requestor, or providing copies of public information to a requestor, without recovering its costs attributable to that personnel time.
    
    (a-1)  For purposes of this section, all county officials who have designated the same officer for public information may calculate the amount of time that personnel are required to spend collectively for purposes of the monthly or yearly limit.
    
    (b)  A yearly time limit established under Subsection (a) may not be less than 36 hours for a requestor during the 12-month period that corresponds to the fiscal year of the governmental body.

The written estimate must be provided to the requestor on or before the 10th day after the date on which the public information was requested.
