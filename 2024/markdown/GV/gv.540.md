In addition to the requirements of Subchapter F, a contract between a Medicaid managed care organization and the commission to which that subchapter applies must include a requirement that the organization implement the process and timeline.
    
    (b)  The process and timeline must:
    
    (1)  allow a provider to submit any documentation identified as insufficient or inadequate in the notice provided under Section [532.0403](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=532.0403);

    (B)  has experience in treating the same category of population as the recipient on whose behalf the provider submitted the request; and
    
    (3)  require the Medicaid managed care organization to amend the determination on the prior authorization request as necessary, considering the additional documentation.
    
    (c)  An adverse determination on a prior authorization request is considered a denial of services in an evaluation of the Medicaid managed care organization only if the determination is not amended under Subsection (b)(3) to approve the request.
    
    (d)  The process and timeline for reconsidering an adverse determination on a prior authorization request under this section do not affect:
    
    (1)  any related timelines, including the timeline for an internal appeal, a Medicaid fair hearing, or a review conducted by an external medical reviewer; or

    Sec. 540.0351.  PREMIUM PAYMENT RATE DETERMINATION.  (a)  In determining premium payment rates paid to a managed care organization under a managed care plan, the commission shall consider:
    
    (1)  the regional variation in health care service costs;
    
    (2)  the range and type of health care services that premium payment rates are to cover;
    
    (3)  the number of managed care plans in a region;
    
    (4)  the current and projected number of recipients in each region, including the current and projected number for each category of recipient;
    
    (5)  the managed care plan's ability to meet operating costs under the proposed premium payment rates;
    
    (6)  the requirements of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Pub. L. No. 105-33) and implementing regulations that require adequacy of premium payments to Medicaid managed care organizations;
    
    (7)  the adequacy of the management fee paid for assisting enrollees of Supplemental Security Income (SSI) (42 U.S.C. Section 1381 et seq.) who are voluntarily enrolled in the managed care plan;
    
    (8)  the impact of reducing premium payment rates for the category of pregnant recipients; and
    
    (9)  the managed care plan's ability under the proposed premium payment rates to pay inpatient and outpatient hospital provider payment rates that are comparable to the inpatient and outpatient hospital provider payment rates the commission pays under a primary care case management model or a partially capitated model.
    
    (b)  The premium payment rates paid to a managed care organization that holds a certificate of authority issued under Chapter [843](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=843), Insurance Code, must be established by a competitive bid process but may not exceed the maximum premium payment rates the commission establishes under Section [540.0352](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=540.0352)(b).
    
    (c)  The commission shall pursue and, if appropriate, implement premium rate-setting strategies that encourage provider payment reform and more efficient service delivery and provider practices.  In pursuing the strategies, the commission shall review and consider strategies employed or under consideration by other states.  If necessary, the commission may request a waiver or other authorization from a federal agency to implement strategies the commission identifies under this subsection.

    Sec. 540.0352.  MAXIMUM PREMIUM PAYMENT RATES FOR CERTAIN PROGRAMS.  (a)  This section applies only to a Medicaid managed care organization that holds a certificate of authority issued under Chapter [843](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=843), Insurance Code, and with respect to Medicaid managed care pilot programs, Medicaid behavioral health pilot programs, and Medicaid STAR+PLUS pilot programs implemented in a health care service region after June 1, 1999.
    
    (b)  In determining the maximum premium payment rates paid to a Medicaid managed care organization to which this section applies, the commission shall consider and adjust for the regional variation in costs of services under the traditional fee-for-service component of Medicaid, utilization patterns, and other factors that influence the potential for cost savings. For a service area with a service area factor of.93 or less, or another appropriate service area factor, as the commission determines, the commission may not discount premium payment rates in an amount that is more than the amount necessary to meet federal budget neutrality requirements for projected fee-for-service costs unless:
    
    (1)  a historical review of managed care financial results among managed care organizations in the service area the organization serves demonstrates that additional savings are warranted; or
    
    (2)  a review of Medicaid fee-for-service delivery in the service area the organization serves has historically shown:
    
    (A)  significant recipient overutilization of certain services covered by the premium payment rates in comparison to utilization patterns throughout the rest of this state; or
    
    (B)  an above-market cost for services for which there is substantial evidence that Medicaid managed care delivery will reduce the cost of those services.

    (1)  the encounter data for the most recent state fiscal year is complete, accurate, and reliable; and

    Sec. 540.0552.  COORDINATION OF BENEFITS; CONTINUITY OF SPECIALTY CARE FOR CERTAIN RECIPIENTS.  (a)  In this section, "Medicaid wrap-around benefit" means a Medicaid-covered service, including a pharmacy or medical benefit, that is provided to a recipient who has primary health benefit plan coverage in addition to Medicaid coverage when:
    
    (1)  the recipient has exceeded the primary health benefit plan coverage limit; or
    
    (2)  the service is not covered by the primary health benefit plan issuer.
    
    (b)  The commission, in coordination with Medicaid managed care organizations and in consultation with the STAR Kids Managed Care Advisory Committee, shall develop and adopt a clear policy for a Medicaid managed care organization to ensure the coordination and timely delivery of Medicaid wrap-around benefits for recipients who have primary health benefit plan coverage in addition to Medicaid coverage. In developing the policy, the commission shall consider requiring a Medicaid managed care organization to allow, notwithstanding Subchapter [F](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=), Chapter [549](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=549), Section [540.0273](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=540.0273), and Section [540.0280](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=540.0280) or any other law, a recipient using a prescription drug for which the recipient's primary health benefit plan issuer previously provided coverage to continue receiving the prescription drug without requiring additional prior authorization.
    
    (c)  If the commission determines that a recipient's primary health benefit plan issuer should have been the primary payor of a claim, the Medicaid managed care organization that paid the claim shall:
    
    (1)  work with the commission on the recovery process; and
    
    (2)  make every attempt to reduce health care provider and recipient abrasion.
    
    (d)  The executive commissioner may seek a waiver from the federal government as needed to:
    
    (1)  address federal policies related to coordination of benefits and third-party liability; and
    
    (2)  maximize federal financial participation for recipients who have primary health benefit plan coverage in addition to Medicaid coverage.
    
    (e)  The commission may include in the Medicaid managed care eligibility files an indication of whether a recipient has primary health benefit plan coverage or is enrolled in a group health benefit plan for which the commission provides premium assistance under the health insurance premium payment program. For a recipient with that coverage or for whom that premium assistance is provided, the files may include the following up-to-date, accurate information related to primary health benefit plan coverage to the extent the information is available to the commission:
    
    (1)  the primary health benefit plan issuer's name and address;
    
    (2)  the recipient's policy number;
    
    (3)  the primary health benefit plan coverage start and end dates; and
    
    (4)  the primary health benefit plan coverage benefits, limits, copayment, and coinsurance information.
    
    (f)  To the extent allowed by federal law, the commission shall maintain processes and policies to allow a health care provider who is primarily providing services to a recipient through primary health benefit plan coverage to receive Medicaid reimbursement for services ordered, referred, or prescribed, regardless of whether the provider is enrolled as a Medicaid provider. The commission shall allow a provider who is not enrolled as a Medicaid provider to order, refer, or prescribe services to a recipient based on the provider's national provider identifier number and may not require an additional state provider identifier number to receive reimbursement for the services. The commission may seek a waiver of Medicaid provider enrollment requirements for providers of recipients with primary health benefit plan coverage to implement this subsection.
    
    (g)  The commission shall develop a clear and easy process, to be implemented through a contract, that allows a recipient with complex medical needs who has established a relationship with a specialty provider to continue receiving care from that provider, regardless of whether the recipient has primary health benefit plan coverage in addition to Medicaid coverage.
    
    (h)  If a recipient who has complex medical needs wants to continue to receive care from a specialty provider that is not in the provider network of the Medicaid managed care organization offering the Medicaid managed care plan in which the recipient is enrolled, the organization shall develop a simple, timely, and efficient process to, and shall make a good-faith effort to, negotiate a single-case agreement with the specialty provider. Until the organization and the specialty provider enter into the single-case agreement, the specialty provider shall be reimbursed in accordance with the applicable reimbursement methodology specified in commission rules, including 1 T.A.C. Section 353.4.
    
    (i)  A single-case agreement entered into under this section is not considered accessing an out-of-network provider for the purposes of Medicaid managed care organization network adequacy requirements.
