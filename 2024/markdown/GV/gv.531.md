    (5)  require a provider to:

    (3)  require mechanical ventilation.
    
    (c-2)  In addition to determining whether to provide home telemonitoring services to Medicaid recipients with the conditions described under Subsection (c)(2), the commission shall determine whether high-risk pregnancy is a condition for which the provision of home telemonitoring services is cost-effective and clinically effective.  If the commission determines that high-risk pregnancy is a condition for which the provision of home telemonitoring services is cost-effective and clinically effective:
    
    (1)  the commission shall, to the extent permitted by state and federal law, provide recipients experiencing a high-risk pregnancy with clinically appropriate home telemonitoring services equipment for temporary use in the recipient's home; and

    (d)  If, after implementation, the commission determines that a condition for which the commission has authorized the provision and reimbursement of home telemonitoring services under Medicaid under this section is not cost-effective and clinically effective, the commission may discontinue the availability of home telemonitoring services for that condition and stop providing reimbursement under Medicaid for home telemonitoring services for that condition, notwithstanding Section [531.0216](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=531.0216) or any other law.
    
    (e)  The commission shall determine whether the provision of home telemonitoring services to persons who are eligible to receive benefits under both Medicaid and the Medicare program achieves cost savings for the Medicare program.
    
    (f)  To comply with state and federal requirements to provide access to medically necessary services under Medicaid, including the Medicaid managed care program, and if the commission determines it is cost-effective and clinically effective, the commission or a Medicaid managed care organization, as applicable, may reimburse providers for home telemonitoring services provided to persons who have conditions and exhibit risk factors other than those expressly authorized by this section.

    Sec. 531.02194.  REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGY FOR RURAL HOSPITALS.  (a)  In this section, "rural hospital" has the meaning assigned by commission rules for purposes of the reimbursement of hospitals for providing inpatient or outpatient services under Medicaid.
    
    (b)  To the extent allowed by federal law and subject to limitations on appropriations, the executive commissioner by rule shall adopt a prospective reimbursement methodology for the payment of rural hospitals participating in Medicaid that ensures the rural hospitals are reimbursed on an individual basis for providing inpatient and general outpatient services to Medicaid recipients by using the hospitals' most recent cost information concerning the costs incurred for providing the services.  The commission shall calculate the prospective cost-based reimbursement rates once every two years.
    
    (c)  In adopting rules under Subsection (b), the executive commissioner may:
    
    (1)  adopt a methodology that requires:
    
    (A)  a managed care organization to reimburse rural hospitals for services delivered through the Medicaid managed care program using a minimum fee schedule or other method for which federal matching money is available; or
    
    (B)  both the commission and a managed care organization to share in the total amount of reimbursement paid to rural hospitals; and

    (d)  Not later than September 1 of each even-numbered year, the commission shall, for purposes of Subsection (b), determine the allowable costs incurred by a rural hospital participating in the Medicaid managed care program based on the rural hospital's cost reports submitted to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and other available information that the commission considers relevant in determining the hospital's allowable costs.
    
    (e)  Notwithstanding Subsection (b) and subject to Subsection (f), the executive commissioner shall adopt and the commission shall implement, beginning with the state fiscal year ending August 31, 2022, a true cost-based reimbursement methodology for inpatient and general outpatient services provided to Medicaid recipients at rural hospitals that provides:
    
    (1)  prospective payments during a state fiscal year to the hospitals using the reimbursement methodology adopted under Subsection (b); and
    
    (2)  to the extent allowed by federal law, in the subsequent state fiscal year a cost settlement to provide additional reimbursement as necessary to reimburse the hospitals for the true costs incurred in providing inpatient and general outpatient services to Medicaid recipients during the previous state fiscal year. 
    
    (f)  Notwithstanding Subsection (e), if federal law does not permit the use of a true cost-based reimbursement methodology described by that subsection, the commission shall continue to use the prospective cost-based reimbursement methodology adopted under Subsection (b) for the payment of rural hospitals for providing inpatient and general outpatient services to Medicaid recipients.

    Sec. 531.02241.  PILOT PROGRAM FOR SELF-SUFFICIENCY OF CERTAIN PERSONS RECEIVING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE OR SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE BENEFITS.  (a)  In this section:
    
    (1)  "Financial assistance benefits" means money payments under the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program operated under Chapter [31](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HR&Value=31), Human Resources Code, or under the state temporary assistance and support services program operated under Chapter [34](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HR&Value=34), Human Resources Code.
    
    (2)  "Self-sufficiency" means being employed in a position that pays a sufficient wage, having financial savings in an amount that is equal to at least $1,000 per member of a family's household, and maintaining a debt-to-income ratio that does not exceed 43 percent.
    
    (3)  "Slow reduction scale" means a graduated plan for reducing financial assistance or supplemental nutrition assistance benefits that correlates with a phase of the pilot program's progressive stages toward self-sufficiency.
    
    (4)  "Sufficient wage" means an amount of money, determined by a market-based calculation that uses geographically specific expenditure data, that is sufficient to meet a family's minimum necessary spending on basic needs, including food, child care, health insurance, housing, and transportation.
    
    (5)  "Supplemental nutrition assistance benefits" means money payments under the supplemental nutrition assistance program operated under Chapter [33](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HR&Value=33), Human Resources Code.
    
    (b)  The commission shall develop and implement a pilot program for assisting not more than 500 eligible families to gain permanent self-sufficiency and no longer require financial assistance, supplemental nutrition assistance, or other means-tested public benefits, notwithstanding the limitations and requirements of Section [31.043](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HR&Value=31.043), Human Resources Code.  If the number of families participating in the program during a year reaches capacity for that year as determined by the commission, the number of families that may be served under the program in the following year may be increased by 20 percent.
    
    (c)  The pilot program will test extending, for at least 24 months but not more than 60 months, financial assistance and supplemental nutrition assistance benefits by waiving the application of income and asset limit eligibility requirements for those benefits and the time limits under Section [31.0065](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HR&Value=31.0065), Human Resources Code, for financial assistance benefits to allow for continuation of financial assistance and supplemental nutrition assistance benefits and reduction of the benefits using a slow reduction scale.  The commission shall freeze a participating family's eligibility status for the benefits beginning on the date the participating family enters the pilot program and ending on the date the family ceases participating in the program.  The waiver of the application of any asset limit requirement must allow the family to have assets in an amount that is at least $1,000 per member of the family's household.
    
    (d)  The pilot program must be designed to allow social services providers, public benefit offices, and other community partners to refer potential participating families to the program.

    (B)  willing, and physically and legally able, to be employed; and
    
    (2)  has a total household income that is less than a sufficient wage based on the family's makeup and geographical area of residence.
    
    (f)  The pilot program must be designed to assist eligible participating families in attaining self-sufficiency by:
    
    (1)  identifying eligibility requirements for the continuation of financial assistance or supplemental nutrition assistance benefits and time limits for the benefits, the application of which may be waived for a limited period and that, if applied, would impede self-sufficiency;
    
    (2)  implementing strategies, including waiving the application of the eligibility requirements and time limits identified in Subdivision (1), to remove barriers to self-sufficiency; and
    
    (3)  moving eligible participating families through progressive stages toward self-sufficiency that include the following phases:
    
    (A)  an initial phase in which a family moves out of an emergent crisis by securing housing, medical care, and financial assistance and supplemental nutrition assistance benefits, as necessary;
    
    (B)  a second phase in which:
    
    (i)  the family moves toward stability by securing employment and, if necessary, child care and by participating in services that build the financial management skills necessary to meet financial goals; and
    
    (ii)  the family's financial assistance and supplemental nutrition assistance benefits are reduced according to the following scale:
    
    (a)  on reaching 25 percent of the family's sufficient wage, the amount of benefits is reduced by 10 percent;
    
    (b)  on reaching 50 percent of the family's sufficient wage, the amount of benefits is reduced by 25 percent; and
    
    (c)  on reaching 75 percent of the family's sufficient wage, the amount of benefits is reduced by 50 percent;
    
    (C)  a third phase in which the family:
    
    (i)  transitions to self-sufficiency by securing employment that pays a sufficient wage, reducing debt, and building savings; and
    
    (ii)  becomes ineligible for financial assistance and supplemental nutrition assistance benefits on reaching 100 percent of the family's sufficient wage; and
    
    (D)  a final phase in which the family attains self-sufficiency by retaining employment that pays a sufficient wage, amassing at least $1,000 per member of the family's household, and having manageable debt so that the family will no longer be dependent on financial assistance, supplemental nutrition assistance, or other means-tested public benefits for at least six months following the date the family stops participating in the program.
    
    (g)  A person from a family that wishes to participate in the pilot program must attend an in-person intake meeting with a program case manager.  During the intake meeting the case manager shall:
    
    (1)  determine whether:
    
    (A)  the person's family meets the eligibility requirements under Subsection (e); and
    
    (B)  the application of income or asset limit eligibility requirements for continuation of financial assistance and supplemental nutrition assistance benefits and the time limits under Section [31.0065](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HR&Value=31.0065), Human Resources Code, for financial assistance benefits may be waived under the program;

    (5)  if the person's family is determined to be eligible for and chooses to participate in the program, schedule a follow-up meeting to further assess the family's crisis, review available referral services, and create a service plan.
    
    (h)  A participating family must be assigned a program case manager who shall:
    
    (1)  if the family is determined to be eligible, provide the family with a verification of the waived application of asset, income, and time limits described by Subsection (c), allowing the family to continue receiving financial assistance and supplemental nutrition assistance benefits on a slow reduction scale;
    
    (2)  assess, at the follow-up meeting scheduled under Subsection (g)(5), the family's crisis, review available referral services, and create a service plan; and
    
    (3)  during the initial phase of the program, create medium- and long-term goals consistent with the strategies developed under Subsection (g)(4).
    
    (i)  The pilot program must provide each participating family placed in the research group described by Subsection (j)(3)(C) with holistic, wraparound case management services that meet all applicable program requirements under 7 C.F.R. Section 273.7(e) or 45 C.F.R. Section 261.10, as applicable. Case management services provided under this subsection must include the strategic use of financial assistance and supplemental nutrition assistance benefits to ensure that the goals included in the family's service plan are achieved. The wraparound case management services must be provided through a community-based provider.
    
    (j)  The pilot program must operate for at least 24 months.  The program shall also include 16 additional months for:
    
    (1)  planning and designing the program before the program begins operation;
    
    (2)  recruiting eligible families to participate in the program;
    
    (3)  randomly placing each participating family in one of at least three research groups, including:
    
    (A)  a control group;
    
    (B)  a group consisting of families for whom the application of income, asset, and time limits described by Subsection (c) is waived; and
    
    (C)  a group consisting of families for whom the application of income, asset, and time limits described by Subsection (c) is waived and who receive wraparound case management services under the program; and
    
    (4)  after the program begins operation, collecting and sharing data that allows for:
    
    (A)  obtaining participating families' eligibility and identification data before a family is randomly placed in a research group under Subdivision (3);
    
    (B)  conducting surveys or interviews of participating families to obtain information that is not contained in records related to a family's eligibility for financial assistance, supplemental nutrition assistance, or other means-tested public benefits;
    
    (C)  providing quarterly reports for not more than 60 months after a participating family is enrolled in the pilot program regarding the program's effect on the family's labor market participation and income and need for means-tested public benefits;
    
    (D)  assessing the interaction of the program's components with the desired outcomes of the program using data collected during the program and data obtained from state agencies concerning means-tested public benefits; and
    
    (E)  a third party to conduct a rigorous experimental impact evaluation of the pilot program.
    
    (k)  The commission shall develop and implement the pilot program with the assistance of the Texas Workforce Commission, local workforce development boards, faith-based and other relevant public or private organizations, and any other entity or person the commission determines appropriate.

(a)  If cost-effective and feasible, the commission shall, on or before March 1, 2008, contract through an existing procurement process for the implementation of an acute care Medicaid billing coordination system for the fee-for-service and primary care case management delivery models that will, upon entry in the claims system, identify within 24 hours whether another entity has primary responsibility for paying the claim and submit the claim to the entity the system determines is the primary payor.  The system may not increase Medicaid claims payment error rates.
    
    (a-1)  If cost-effective and feasible, the commission shall contract to expand the Medicaid billing coordination system described by Subsection (a) to process claims for all other health care services provided through Medicaid in the manner claims for acute care services are processed by the system under Subsection (a).  This subsection does not apply to claims for health care services provided through Medicaid if, before September 1, 2009, those claims were being processed by an alternative billing coordination system.
    
    (b)  If cost-effective, the executive commissioner shall adopt rules for the purpose of enabling the system described by Subsection (a) to identify an entity with primary responsibility for paying a claim that is processed by the system under Subsection (a) and establish reporting requirements for any entity that may have a contractual responsibility to pay for the types of services that are provided under Medicaid and the claims for which are processed by the system under Subsection (a).
    
    (c)  An entity that holds a permit, license, or certificate of authority issued by a regulatory agency of the state must allow a contractor under this section access to databases to allow the contractor to carry out the purposes of this section, subject to the contractor's contract with the commission and rules adopted under this section, and is subject to an administrative penalty or other sanction as provided by the law applicable to the permit, license, or certificate of authority for a violation by the entity of a rule adopted under this section.
    
    (d)  After September 1, 2008, no public funds shall be expended on entities not in compliance with this section unless a memorandum of understanding is entered into between the entity and the executive commissioner.
    
    (e)  Information obtained under this section is confidential.  The contractor may use the information only for the purposes authorized under this section.  A person commits an offense if the person knowingly uses information obtained under this section for any purpose not authorized under this section.  An offense under this subsection is a Class B misdemeanor and all other penalties may apply.

    Sec. 531.024164.  EXTERNAL MEDICAL REVIEW.  (a)  In this section, "external medical reviewer" and "reviewer" mean a third-party medical review organization that provides objective, unbiased medical necessity determinations conducted by clinical staff with education and practice in the same or similar practice area as the procedure for which an independent determination of medical necessity is sought in accordance with applicable state law and rules.
    
    (b)  The commission shall contract with an independent external medical reviewer to conduct external medical reviews and review:
    
    (1)  the resolution of a Medicaid recipient appeal related to a reduction in or denial of services on the basis of medical necessity in the Medicaid managed care program; or
    
    (2)  a denial by the commission of eligibility for a Medicaid program in which eligibility is based on a Medicaid recipient's medical and functional needs.
    
    (c)  A Medicaid managed care organization may not have a financial relationship with or ownership interest in the external medical reviewer with which the commission contracts.
    
    (d)  The external medical reviewer with which the commission contracts must:
    
    (1)  be overseen by a medical director who is a physician licensed in this state; and
    
    (2)  employ or be able to consult with staff with experience in providing private duty nursing services and long-term services and supports.
    
    (e)  The commission shall establish a common procedure for reviews.  To the greatest extent possible, the procedure must reduce administrative burdens on providers and the submission of duplicative information or documents.  Medical necessity under the procedure must be based on publicly available, up-to-date, evidence-based, and peer-reviewed clinical criteria.  The reviewer shall conduct the review within a period specified by the commission.  The commission shall also establish a procedure and time frame for expedited reviews that allows the reviewer to:
    
    (1)  identify an appeal that requires an expedited resolution; and
    
    (2)  resolve the review of the appeal within a specified period.
    
    (f)  A Medicaid recipient or applicant, or the recipient's or applicant's parent or legally authorized representative, must affirmatively request an external medical review.  If requested:
    
    (1)  an external medical review described by Subsection (b)(1) occurs after the internal Medicaid managed care organization appeal and before the Medicaid fair hearing and is granted when a Medicaid recipient contests the internal appeal decision of the Medicaid managed care organization; and
    
    (2)  an external medical review described by Subsection (b)(2) occurs after the eligibility denial and before the Medicaid fair hearing.
    
    (g)  The external medical reviewer's determination of medical necessity establishes the minimum level of services a Medicaid recipient must receive, except that the level of services may not exceed the level identified as medically necessary by the ordering health care provider.
    
    (h)  The external medical reviewer shall require a Medicaid managed care organization, in an external medical review relating to a reduction in services, to submit a detailed reason for the reduction and supporting documents.
    
    (i)  To the extent money is appropriated for this purpose, the commission shall publish data regarding prior authorizations reviewed by the external medical reviewer, including the rate of prior authorization denials overturned by the external medical reviewer and additional information the commission and the external medical reviewer determine appropriate.

    (b)  If cost-effective, the commission shall develop an objective assessment process for use in assessing a Medicaid recipient's needs for acute nursing services.  If the commission develops an objective assessment process under this section, the commission shall require that:
    
    (1)  the assessment be conducted:
    
    (A)  by a state employee or contractor who is a registered nurse who is licensed to practice in this state and who is not the person who will deliver any necessary services to the recipient and is not affiliated with the person who will deliver those services; and
    
    (B)  in a timely manner so as to protect the health and safety of the recipient by avoiding unnecessary delays in service delivery; and
    
    (2)  the process include:
    
    (A)  an assessment of specified criteria and documentation of the assessment results on a standard form;
    
    (B)  an assessment of whether the recipient should be referred for additional assessments regarding the recipient's needs for therapy services, as defined by Section [531.024171](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=531.024171), attendant care services, and durable medical equipment; and
    
    (C)  completion by the person conducting the assessment of any documents related to obtaining prior authorization for necessary nursing services.
    
    (c)  If the commission develops the objective assessment process under Subsection (b), the commission shall:
    
    (1)  implement the process within the Medicaid fee-for-service model and the primary care case management Medicaid managed care model; and
    
    (2)  take necessary actions, including modifying contracts with managed care organizations under Chapter [533](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=533) to the extent allowed by law, to implement the process within the STAR and STAR + PLUS Medicaid managed care programs.
    
    (d)  Unless the commission determines that the assessment is feasible and beneficial, an assessment under Subsection (b)(2)(B) of whether a recipient should be referred for additional therapy services shall be waived if the recipient's need for therapy services has been established by a recommendation from a therapist providing care prior to discharge of the recipient from a licensed hospital or nursing home.  The assessment may not be waived if the recommendation is made by a therapist who will deliver any services to the recipient or is affiliated with a person who will deliver those services when the recipient is discharged from the licensed hospital or nursing home.
    
    (e)  The executive commissioner shall adopt rules providing for a process by which a provider of acute nursing services who disagrees with the results of the assessment conducted under Subsection (b) may request and obtain a review of those results.

(a)  Not later than March 31, 2018, the commission shall conduct a review of the electronic visit verification system in use under this section on August 31, 2017.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the commission is required to implement a change in law made to this section by S.B. 894, Acts of the 85th Legislature, Regular Session, 2017, only if the commission determines the implementation is appropriate based on the findings of the review.  The commission may combine the review required by this subsection with any similar review required to be conducted by the commission.
    
    (b)  Subject to Subsection (g), the commission shall, in accordance with federal law, implement an electronic visit verification system to electronically verify through a telephone, global positioning, or computer-based system that personal care services, attendant care services, or other services identified by the commission that are provided to recipients under Medicaid, including personal care services or attendant care services provided under the Texas Health Care Transformation and Quality Improvement Program waiver issued under Section 1115 of the federal Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. Section 1315) or any other Medicaid waiver program, are provided to recipients in accordance with a prior authorization or plan of care.  The electronic visit verification system implemented under this subsection must allow for verification of only the following information relating to the delivery of Medicaid services:
    
    (1)  the type of service provided;
    
    (2)  the name of the recipient to whom the service is provided;
    
    (3)  the date and times the provider began and ended the service delivery visit;
    
    (4)  the location, including the address, at which the service was provided;
    
    (5)  the name of the individual who provided the service; and
    
    (6)  other information the commission determines is necessary to ensure the accurate adjudication of Medicaid claims.
    
    (c)  The commission shall inform each Medicaid recipient who receives personal care services, attendant care services, or other services identified by the commission that the health care provider providing the services and the recipient are each required to comply with the electronic visit verification system.  A managed care organization that contracts with the commission to provide health care services to Medicaid recipients described by this subsection shall also inform recipients enrolled in a managed care plan offered by the organization of those requirements.
    
    (d)  In implementing the electronic visit verification system:
    
    (1)  subject to Subsection (e), the executive commissioner shall adopt compliance standards for health care providers; and
    
    (2)  the commission shall ensure that:
    
    (A)  the information required to be reported by health care providers is standardized across managed care organizations that contract with the commission to provide health care services to Medicaid recipients and across commission programs;
    
    (B)  processes required by managed care organizations to retrospectively correct data are standardized and publicly accessible to health care providers;
    
    (C)  standardized processes are established for addressing the failure of a managed care organization to provide a timely authorization for delivering services necessary to ensure continuity of care; and
    
    (D)  a health care provider is allowed to enter a variable schedule into the electronic visit verification system.
    
    (e)  In establishing compliance standards for health care providers under Subsection (d), the executive commissioner shall consider:
    
    (1)  the administrative burdens placed on health care providers required to comply with the standards; and
    
    (2)  the benefits of using emerging technologies for ensuring compliance, including Internet-based, mobile telephone-based, and global positioning-based technologies.
    
    (f)  A health care provider that provides personal care services, attendant care services, or other services identified by the commission to Medicaid recipients shall:
    
    (1)  use an electronic visit verification system to document the provision of those services;
    
    (2)  comply with all documentation requirements established by the commission;
    
    (3)  comply with applicable federal and state laws regarding confidentiality of recipients' information;
    
    (4)  ensure that the commission or the managed care organization with which a claim for reimbursement for a service is filed may review electronic visit verification system documentation related to the claim or obtain a copy of that documentation at no charge to the commission or the organization; and
    
    (5)  at any time, allow the commission or a managed care organization with which a health care provider contracts to provide health care services to recipients enrolled in the organization's managed care plan to have direct, on-site access to the electronic visit verification system in use by the health care provider.
    
    (g)  The commission may recognize a health care provider's proprietary electronic visit verification system, whether purchased or developed by the provider, as complying with this section and allow the health care provider to use that system for a period determined by the commission if the commission determines that the system:
    
    (1)  complies with all necessary data submission, exchange, and reporting requirements established under this section; and
    
    (2)  meets all other standards and requirements established under this section.
    
    (g-1)  If feasible, the executive commissioner shall ensure a health care provider that uses the provider's proprietary electronic visit verification system recognized under Subsection (g) is reimbursed for the use of that system.
    
    (g-2)  For purposes of facilitating the use of proprietary electronic visit verification systems by health care providers under Subsection (g) and in consultation with industry stakeholders and the work group established under Subsection (h), the commission or the executive commissioner, as appropriate, shall:
    
    (1)  develop an open model system that mitigates the administrative burdens identified by providers required to use electronic visit verification;
    
    (2)  allow providers to use emerging technologies, including Internet-based, mobile telephone-based, and global positioning-based technologies, in the providers' proprietary electronic visit verification systems; and
    
    (3)  adopt rules governing data submission and provider reimbursement.
    
    (h)  The commission shall create a stakeholder work group comprised of representatives of affected health care providers, managed care organizations, and Medicaid recipients and periodically solicit from that work group input regarding the ongoing operation of the electronic visit verification system under this section.

    Sec. 531.0244.  ENSURING APPROPRIATE CARE SETTING FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES.  (a)  The commission and appropriate health and human services agencies shall implement a comprehensive, effectively working plan that provides a system of services and support that fosters independence and productivity and provides meaningful opportunities for a person with a disability to live in the most appropriate care setting, considering:
    
    (1)  the person's physical, medical, and behavioral needs;
    
    (2)  the least restrictive care setting in which the person can reside;
    
    (3)  the person's choice of care settings in which to reside;

    (5)  the availability of state programs for which the person qualifies that can assist the person.
    
    (b)  The comprehensive, effectively working plan required by Subsection (a) must require appropriate health and human services agencies to:
    
    (1)  provide to a person with a disability living in an institution and to any other person as required by Sections [531.042](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=531.042) and [531.02442](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=531.02442) information regarding care and support options available to the person with a disability, including community-based services appropriate to the needs of that person;
    
    (2)  recognize that certain persons with disabilities are represented by legally authorized representatives as defined by Section [241.151](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=241.151), Health and Safety Code, whom the agencies must include in any decision-making process facilitated by the plan's implementation;
    
    (3)  facilitate a timely and appropriate transfer of a person with a disability from an institution to an appropriate setting in the community if:
    
    (A)  the person chooses to live in the community;
    
    (B)  the person's treating professionals determine the transfer is appropriate;  and
    
    (C)  the transfer can be reasonably accommodated, considering the state's available resources and the needs of other persons with disabilities;  and
    
    (4)  develop strategies to prevent the unnecessary placement in an institution of a person with a disability who is living in the community but is in imminent risk of requiring placement in an institution because of a lack of community services.
    
    (c)  For purposes of developing the strategies required by Subsection (b)(4), a person with a mental illness who is admitted to a facility of the Department of State Health Services for inpatient mental health services three or more times during a 180-day period is presumed to be in imminent risk of requiring placement in an institution.  The strategies must be developed in a manner that presumes the person's eligibility for and the appropriateness of intensive community-based services and support.
    
    (c-1)  For purposes of determining the appropriateness of transfers under Subsection (b)(3) and developing the strategies required by Subsection (b)(4), a health and human services agency shall presume the eligibility of a child residing in a general residential operation, as defined by Section [42.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HR&Value=42.002), Human Resources Code, for transfer to an appropriate community-based setting.
    
    (d)  In implementing the plan required by Subsection (a), a health and human services agency may not deny an eligible person with a disability access to an institution or remove an eligible person with a disability from an institution if the person prefers the type and degree of care provided in the institution and that care is appropriate for the person.  A health and human services agency may deny the person access to an institution or remove the person from an institution to protect the person's health or safety.
    
    (e)  Each appropriate health and human services agency shall implement the strategies and recommendations under the plan required by Subsection (a) subject to the availability of funds.
    
    (f)  This section does not create a cause of action.

    (g)  In making a grant to a community-based organization, the commission shall evaluate the organization's proposal based on demonstrated need and the merit of the proposal.  If a combination of community-based organizations makes a proposal, the combination must designate a single organization to receive and administer the grant.  The commission may adopt guidelines for proposals under this subsection.  The commission shall give priority to proposals that will use the Internet and related information technologies to provide to clients referral services, other information regarding local long-term care services, and needs assessment.  To receive a grant under this section, a community-based organization must at least partially match the state grant with money or other resources obtained from a nongovernmental entity, from a local government, or if the community-based organization is a local government, from fees or taxes collected by the local government.  The community-based organization may then combine the money or resources the organization obtains from a variety of state, local, federal, or private sources to accomplish the purpose of the proposal.  If a community-based organization receives a grant on behalf of a combination of community-based organizations or if the community-based organization's proposal involved coordinating with other entities to accomplish the purpose of the proposal, the commission may condition receipt of the grant on the organization's making a good faith effort to coordinate with other entities in the manner indicated in the proposal.

    Sec. 531.043.  LONG-TERM CARE VISION.  (a)  In conjunction with the appropriate state agencies, the executive commissioner shall develop a plan for access to individualized long-term care services for persons with functional limitations or medical needs and their families that assists those persons in achieving and maintaining the greatest possible independence, autonomy, and quality of life.
    
    (b)  The guiding principles and goals of the plan focusing on the individual and the individual's family must:
    
    (1)  recognize that it is the policy of this state that children should grow up in families and that persons with disabilities and elderly persons should live in the setting of their choice;  and
    
    (2)  ensure that persons needing assistance and their families will have:
    
    (A)  the maximum possible control over their services;
    
    (B)  a choice of a broad, comprehensive array of services designed to meet individual needs;  and

    (4)  maximize resources to the greatest extent possible, with the consumer receiving only the services that the consumer prefers and that are indicated by a functional assessment of need;  and
    
    (5)  structure the service delivery system to support these goals, ensuring that any necessary complexity of the system is at the administrative level rather than at the client level.
    
    (d)  The commission shall coordinate state services to ensure that:
    
    (1)  the roles and responsibilities of the agencies providing long-term care are clarified;  and

    (e)  In this section, "long-term care" means the provision of health care, personal care, and assistance related to health and social services over a sustained period to people of all ages and their families, regardless of the setting in which the care is given.

(a)  The purpose of the system of family-based alternatives required by this section is to further the state's policy of providing for a child's basic needs for safety, security, and stability through ensuring that a child becomes a part of a successful permanent family as soon as possible.
    
    (b)  In achieving the purpose described by Subsection (a), the system is intended to be operated in a manner that recognizes that parents are a valued and integral part of the process established under the system.

To be eligible for the contract under this subsection, an organization must possess knowledge regarding the support needs of children with disabilities and their families.  For purposes of this subsection, a community organization, including a faith-based community organization, or a nonprofit organization does not include:
    
    (1)  any governmental entity;  or

    (e)  The contractor may subcontract for one or more components of implementation of the system with:
    
    (1)  community organizations, including faith-based community organizations;
    
    (2)  nonprofit organizations;
    
    (3)  governmental entities;  or

    (g)  Each affected health and human services agency shall cooperate with the contractor and any subcontractors and take all action necessary to implement the system and comply with the requirements of this section.  The commission has final authority to make any decisions and resolve any disputes regarding the system.
    
    (h)  The system may be administered in cooperation with public and private entities.

    (4)  identifying each child residing in an institution and offering support services, including waiver services, that would enable the child to return to the child's birth family or be placed in a family-based alternative;  and
    
    (5)  determining through a child's permanency plan other circumstances in which the child must be offered waiver services, including circumstances in which changes in an institution's status affect the child's placement or the quality of services received by the child.
    
    (j)  In complying with the requirement imposed by Subsection (i)(3), the commission shall ensure that the procedures for providing information to parents or a guardian permit and encourage the participation of an individual who is not affiliated with the institution in which the child resides or with an institution in which the child could be placed.
    
    (k)  In placing a child in a family-based alternative, the system may use a variety of placement options, including an arrangement in which shared parenting occurs between the alternative family and the child's birth family.  Regardless of the option used, a family-based alternative placement must be designed to be a long-term arrangement, except in cases in which the child's birth family chooses to return the child to their home.  In cases in which the birth family's parental rights have been terminated, adoption of the child by the child's alternative family is an available option.
    
    (l)  The commission or the contractor may solicit and accept gifts, grants, and donations to support the system's functions under this section.
    
    (m)  In designing the system, the commission shall consider and, when appropriate, incorporate current research and recommendations developed by other public and private entities involved in analyzing public policy relating to children residing in institutions.
    
    (n)  As necessary to implement this section, the commission shall:
    
    (1)  ensure that an appropriate number of openings for waiver services that become available as a result of funding for the purpose of transferring persons with disabilities into community-based services are made available to both children and adults;
    
    (2)  ensure that service definitions applicable to waiver services are modified as necessary to permit the provision of waiver services through family-based alternatives;
    
    (3)  ensure that procedures are implemented for making a level of care determination for each child and identifying the most appropriate waiver service for the child, including procedures under which the director of long-term care for the commission, after considering any preference of the child's birth family or alternative family, resolves disputes among agencies about the most appropriate waiver service;  and
    
    (4)  require that the health and human services agency responsible for providing a specific waiver service to a child also assume responsibility for identifying any necessary transition activities or services.
    
    (o)  Not later than January 1 of each year, the commission shall report to the legislature on the implementation of the system.  The report must include a statement of:
    
    (1)  the number of children currently receiving care in an institution;
    
    (2)  the number of children placed in a family-based alternative under the system during the preceding year;
    
    (3)  the number of children who left an institution during the preceding year under an arrangement other than a family-based alternative under the system or for another reason unrelated to the availability of a family-based alternative under the system;
    
    (4)  the number of children waiting for an available placement in a family-based alternative under the system;  and

    (b)  A legally authorized representative of a child who is notified by the commission that the child is no longer eligible for the medically dependent children (MDCP) waiver program following a Medicaid fair hearing, or without a Medicaid fair hearing if the representative opted in writing to forego the hearing, may request that the commission:

    (2)  place the child on the interest list for another Section 1915(c) waiver program.
    
    (c)  At the time a child's legally authorized representative makes a request under Subsection (b), the commission shall:

    (d)  Notwithstanding Subsection (c)(1)(B) or (c)(2), a child may be placed on an interest list for a Section 1915(c) waiver program in the position described by those subsections only if the child has previously been placed on the interest list for that waiver program.

    (b)  For purposes of this section, the term "supplemental rebates" means cash rebates paid by a manufacturer to the state on the basis of appropriate quarterly health and human services program utilization data relating to the manufacturer's products, pursuant to a state supplemental rebate agreement negotiated with the manufacturer and, if necessary, approved by the federal government under Section 1927 of the federal Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. Section 1396r-8).
    
    (c)  The commission may enter into a written agreement with a manufacturer to accept certain program benefits in lieu of supplemental rebates, as defined by this section, only if:
    
    (1)  the program benefit yields savings that are at least equal to the amount the manufacturer would have provided under a state supplemental rebate agreement during the current biennium as determined by the written agreement;
    
    (2)  the manufacturer posts a performance bond guaranteeing savings to the state, and agrees that if the savings are not achieved in accordance with the written agreement, the manufacturer will forfeit the bond to the state less any savings that were achieved; and

    (d)  For purposes of this section, a program benefit may mean disease management programs authorized under this title, drug product donation programs, drug utilization control programs, prescriber and beneficiary counseling and education, fraud and abuse initiatives, and other services or administrative investments with guaranteed savings to a program operated by a health and human services agency.
    
    (e)  Other than as required to satisfy the provisions of this section, the program benefits shall be deemed an alternative to, and not the equivalent of, supplemental rebates and shall be treated in the state's submissions to the federal government (including, as appropriate, waiver requests and quarterly Medicaid claims) so as to maximize the availability of federal matching payments.
    
    (f)  Agreements by the commission to accept program benefits as defined by this section:
    
    (1)  may not prohibit the commission from entering into similar agreements related to different drug classes with other entities;

    (g)  For purposes of this section, the commission may consider a monetary contribution or donation to the arrangements described in Subsection (c) for the purpose of offsetting expenditures to other state health care programs, but which funding may not be used to offset expenditures for covered outpatient drugs as defined by 42 U.S.C. Section 1396r-8(k)(2) under the vendor drug program.  An arrangement under this subsection may not yield less than the amount the state would have benefited under a supplemental rebate.  The commission may consider an arrangement under this section as satisfying the requirements related to Section [531.072](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=531.072)(b).

    (i)  The commission may by contract authorize a private entity to negotiate with manufacturers and labelers on behalf of the commission.
    
    (j)  A manufacturer or labeler that sells prescription drugs in this state may voluntarily negotiate with the commission and enter into an agreement to provide supplemental rebates for prescription drugs provided under:
    
    (1)  the Medicaid vendor drug program in excess of the Medicaid rebates required by 42 U.S.C. Section 1396r-8 and its subsequent amendments;
    
    (2)  the child health plan program;  and
    
    (3)  any other state program administered by the commission or a health and human services agency, including community mental health centers and state mental health hospitals.

    Sec. 531.072.  PREFERRED DRUG LISTS.  (a)  In a manner that complies with applicable state and federal law, the commission shall adopt preferred drug lists for the Medicaid vendor drug program and for prescription drugs purchased through the child health plan program.  The commission may adopt preferred drug lists for community mental health centers, state mental health hospitals, and any other state program administered by the commission or a state health and human services agency.
    
    (b)  The preferred drug lists may contain only drugs provided by a manufacturer or labeler that reaches an agreement with the commission on supplemental rebates under Section [531.070](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=531.070).
    
    (b-1)  Notwithstanding Subsection (b), the preferred drug lists may contain:
    
    (1)  a drug provided by a manufacturer or labeler that has not reached a supplemental rebate agreement with the commission if the commission determines that inclusion of the drug on the preferred drug lists will have no negative cost impact to the state; or
    
    (2)  a drug provided by a manufacturer or labeler that has reached an agreement with the commission to provide program benefits in lieu of supplemental rebates, as described by Section [531.070](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=531.070).

    (c)  In making a decision regarding the placement of a drug on each of the preferred drug lists, the commission shall consider:

    (3)  the price of competing drugs after deducting any federal and state rebate amounts; and
    
    (4)  program benefit offerings solely or in conjunction with rebates and other pricing information.

    (1)  a manufacturer or labeler may submit written evidence supporting the inclusion of a drug on the preferred drug lists before a supplemental agreement is reached with the commission; and
    
    (2)  any drug that has been approved or has had any of its particular uses approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration under a priority review classification will be reviewed by the Drug Utilization Review Board at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the board.  On receiving notice from a manufacturer or labeler of the availability of a new product, the commission, to the extent possible, shall schedule a review for the product at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the board.
    
    (f)  A recipient of drug benefits under the Medicaid vendor drug program may appeal a denial of prior authorization under Section [531.073](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=531.073) of a covered drug or covered dosage through the Medicaid fair hearing process.
    
    (g)  The commission shall develop an expedited review process to consider requests from managed care organizations and providers to add drugs to the preferred drug list.
    
    (h)  The commission shall grant temporary non-preferred status to new drugs that are available but have not yet been reviewed by the drug utilization review board and establish criteria for authorizing drugs with temporary non-preferred status.

    (d)  Except as otherwise provided by this section and subject to the terms of the waiver authorized by this section, the commission has broad discretion to develop the tailored benefit packages under this section and determine the respective categories of Medicaid recipients to which the packages apply in a manner that preserves recipients' access to necessary services and is consistent with federal requirements.

    Sec. 531.102.  OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL.  (a)  The commission's office of inspector general is responsible for the prevention, detection, audit, inspection, review, and investigation of fraud, waste, and abuse in the provision and delivery of all health and human services in the state, including services through any state-administered health or human services program that is wholly or partly federally funded or services provided by the Department of Family and Protective Services, and the enforcement of state law relating to the provision of those services.  The commission may obtain any information or technology necessary to enable the office to meet its responsibilities under this subchapter or other law.
    
    (a-1)  The governor shall appoint an inspector general to serve as director of the office.  The inspector general serves a one-year term that expires on February 1.
    
    (a-2)  The executive commissioner shall work in consultation with the office whenever the executive commissioner is required by law to adopt a rule or policy necessary to implement a power or duty of the office, including a rule necessary to carry out a responsibility of the office under Subsection (a).
    
    (a-3)  The executive commissioner is responsible for performing all administrative support services functions necessary to operate the office in the same manner that the executive commissioner is responsible for providing administrative support services functions for the health and human services system, including functions of the office related to the following:
    
    (1)  procurement processes;
    
    (2)  contracting policies;
    
    (3)  information technology services;
    
    (4)  subject to Subsection (a-8), legal services;
    
    (5)  budgeting; and
    
    (6)  personnel and employment policies.
    
    (a-4)  The commission's internal audit division shall regularly audit the office as part of the commission's internal audit program and shall include the office in the commission's risk assessments.
    
    (a-5)  The office shall closely coordinate with the executive commissioner and the relevant staff of health and human services system programs that the office oversees in performing functions relating to the prevention of fraud, waste, and abuse in the delivery of health and human services and the enforcement of state law relating to the provision of those services, including audits, utilization reviews, provider education, and data analysis.
    
    (a-6)  The office shall conduct audits, inspections, and investigations independent of the executive commissioner and the commission but shall rely on the coordination required by Subsection (a-5) to ensure that the office has a thorough understanding of the health and human services system for purposes of knowledgeably and effectively performing the office's duties under this section and any other law.
    
    (a-7)  The chief counsel for the commission is the final authority for all legal interpretations related to statutes, rules, and commission policy on programs administered by the commission.
    
    (a-8)  For purposes of Subsection (a-3), "legal services" includes only legal services related to open records, procurement, contracting, human resources, privacy, litigation support by the attorney general, bankruptcy, and other legal services as detailed in the memorandum of understanding or other written agreement required under Section [531.00553](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=531.00553), as added by Chapter 837 (S.B. 200), Acts of the 84th Legislature, Regular Session, 2015.
    
    (b)  The commission, in consultation with the inspector general, shall set clear objectives, priorities, and performance standards for the office that emphasize:
    
    (1)  coordinating investigative efforts to aggressively recover money;
    
    (2)  allocating resources to cases that have the strongest supportive evidence and the greatest potential for recovery of money;  and
    
    (3)  maximizing opportunities for referral of cases to the office of the attorney general in accordance with Section [531.103](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=531.103).
    
    (c)  The commission shall train office staff to enable the staff to pursue priority Medicaid and other health and human services fraud and abuse cases as necessary.
    
    (d)  The commission may require employees of health and human services agencies to provide assistance to the office in connection with the office's duties relating to the investigation of fraud and abuse in the provision of health and human services.  The office is entitled to access to any information maintained by a health and human services agency, including internal records, relevant to the functions of the office.
    
    (e)  The executive commissioner, in consultation with the inspector general, by rule shall set specific claims criteria that, when met, require the office to begin an investigation.
    
    (f)(1)  If the commission receives a complaint or allegation of Medicaid fraud or abuse from any source, the office must conduct a preliminary investigation as provided by Section [531.118](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=531.118)(c) to determine whether there is a sufficient basis to warrant a full investigation.  A preliminary investigation must begin not later than the 30th day, and be completed not later than the 45th day, after the date the commission receives a complaint or allegation or has reason to believe that fraud or abuse has occurred. 
    
    (2)  If the findings of a preliminary investigation give the office reason to believe that an incident of fraud or abuse involving possible criminal conduct has occurred in Medicaid, the office must take the following action, as appropriate, not later than the 30th day after the completion of the preliminary investigation:
    
    (A)  if a provider is suspected of fraud or abuse involving criminal conduct, the office must refer the case to the state's Medicaid fraud control unit, provided that the criminal referral does not preclude the office from continuing its investigation of the provider, which investigation may lead to the imposition of appropriate administrative or civil sanctions; or
    
    (B)  if there is reason to believe that a recipient has defrauded Medicaid, the office may conduct a full investigation of the suspected fraud, subject to Section [531.118](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=531.118)(c).
    
    (f-1)  The office shall complete a full investigation of a complaint or allegation of Medicaid fraud or abuse against a provider not later than the 180th day after the date the full investigation begins unless the office determines that more time is needed to complete the investigation.  Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, if the office determines that more time is needed to complete the investigation, the office shall provide notice to the provider who is the subject of the investigation stating that the length of the investigation will exceed 180 days and specifying the reasons why the office was unable to complete the investigation within the 180-day period.  The office is not required to provide notice to the provider under this subsection if the office determines that providing notice would jeopardize the investigation. 
    
    (g)(1)  Whenever the office learns or has reason to suspect that a provider's records are being withheld, concealed, destroyed, fabricated, or in any way falsified, the office shall immediately refer the case to the state's Medicaid fraud control unit.  However, such criminal referral does not preclude the office from continuing its investigation of the provider, which investigation may lead to the imposition of appropriate administrative or civil sanctions.
    
    (2)  As authorized under state and federal law, and except as provided by Subdivisions (8) and (9), the office shall impose without prior notice a payment hold on claims for reimbursement submitted by a provider only to compel production of records, when requested by the state's Medicaid fraud control unit, or on the determination that a credible allegation of fraud exists, subject to Subsections (l) and (m), as applicable.  The payment hold is a serious enforcement tool that the office imposes to mitigate ongoing financial risk to the state.  A payment hold imposed under this subdivision takes effect immediately.  The office must notify the provider of the payment hold in accordance with 42 C.F.R. Section 455.23(b) and, except as provided by that regulation, not later than the fifth day after the date the office imposes the payment hold.  In addition to the requirements of 42 C.F.R. Section 455.23(b), the notice of payment hold provided under this subdivision must also include:
    
    (A)  the specific basis for the hold, including identification of the claims supporting the allegation at that point in the investigation, a representative sample of any documents that form the basis for the hold, and a detailed summary of the office's evidence relating to the allegation;
    
    (B)  a description of administrative and judicial due process rights and remedies, including the provider's option to seek informal resolution, the provider's right to seek a formal administrative appeal hearing, or that the provider may seek both; and
    
    (C)  a detailed timeline for the provider to pursue the rights and remedies described in Paragraph (B).
    
    (3)  On timely written request by a provider subject to a payment hold under Subdivision (2), other than a hold requested by the state's Medicaid fraud control unit, the office shall file a request with the State Office of Administrative Hearings for an expedited administrative hearing regarding the hold not later than the third day after the date the office receives the provider's request.  The provider must request an expedited administrative hearing under this subdivision not later than the 10th day after the date the provider receives notice from the office under Subdivision (2).  The State Office of Administrative Hearings shall hold the expedited administrative hearing not later than the 45th day after the date the State Office of Administrative Hearings receives the request for the hearing.  In a hearing held under this subdivision:
    
    (A)  the provider and the office are each limited to four hours of testimony, excluding time for responding to questions from the administrative law judge;
    
    (B)  the provider and the office are each entitled to two continuances under reasonable circumstances; and
    
    (C)  the office is required to show probable cause that the credible allegation of fraud that is the basis of the payment hold has an indicia of reliability and that continuing to pay the provider presents an ongoing significant financial risk to the state and a threat to the integrity of Medicaid.
    
    (4)  The office is responsible for the costs of a hearing held under Subdivision (3), but a provider is responsible for the provider's own costs incurred in preparing for the hearing.
    
    (5)  In a hearing held under Subdivision (3), the administrative law judge shall decide if the payment hold should continue but may not adjust the amount or percent of the payment hold.  Notwithstanding any other law, including Section [2001.058](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001.058)(e), the decision of the administrative law judge is final and may not be appealed.
    
    (6)  The executive commissioner, in consultation with the office, shall adopt rules that allow a provider subject to a payment hold under Subdivision (2), other than a hold requested by the state's Medicaid fraud control unit, to seek an informal resolution of the issues identified by the office in the notice provided under that subdivision.  A provider must request an initial informal resolution meeting under this subdivision not later than the deadline prescribed by Subdivision (3) for requesting an expedited administrative hearing.  On receipt of a timely request, the office shall decide whether to grant the provider's request for an initial informal resolution meeting, and if the office decides to grant the request, the office shall schedule the initial informal resolution meeting.  The office shall give notice to the provider of the time and place of the initial informal resolution meeting.  A provider may request a second informal resolution meeting after the date of the initial informal resolution meeting.  On receipt of a timely request, the office shall decide whether to grant the provider's request for a second informal resolution meeting, and if the office decides to grant the request, the office shall schedule the second informal resolution meeting.  The office shall give notice to the provider of the time and place of the second informal resolution meeting.  A provider must have an opportunity to provide additional information before the second informal resolution meeting for consideration by the office.  A provider's decision to seek an informal resolution under this subdivision does not extend the time by which the provider must request an expedited administrative hearing under Subdivision (3).  The informal resolution process shall run concurrently with the administrative hearing process, and the informal resolution process shall be discontinued once the State Office of Administrative Hearings issues a final determination on the payment hold. 
    
    (7)  The office shall, in consultation with the state's Medicaid fraud control unit, establish guidelines under which program exclusions:
    
    (A)  may permissively be imposed on a provider; or
    
    (B)  shall automatically be imposed on a provider.
    
    (7-a)  The office shall, in consultation with the state's Medicaid fraud control unit, establish guidelines regarding the imposition of payment holds authorized under Subdivision (2).
    
    (8)  In accordance with 42 C.F.R. Sections 455.23(e) and (f), on the determination that a credible allegation of fraud exists, the office may find that good cause exists to not impose a payment hold, to not continue a payment hold, to impose a payment hold only in part, or to convert a payment hold imposed in whole to one imposed only in part, if any of the following are applicable:
    
    (A)  law enforcement officials have specifically requested that a payment hold not be imposed because a payment hold would compromise or jeopardize an investigation;
    
    (B)  available remedies implemented by the state other than a payment hold would more effectively or quickly protect Medicaid funds;
    
    (C)  the office determines, based on the submission of written evidence by the provider who is the subject of the payment hold, that the payment hold should be removed;
    
    (D)  Medicaid recipients' access to items or services would be jeopardized by a full or partial payment hold because the provider who is the subject of the payment hold:
    
    (i)  is the sole community physician or the sole source of essential specialized services in a community; or 
    
    (ii)  serves a large number of Medicaid recipients within a designated medically underserved area;
    
    (E)  the attorney general declines to certify that a matter continues to be under investigation; or 
    
    (F)  the office determines that a full or partial payment hold is not in the best interests of Medicaid.
    
    (9)  The office may not impose a payment hold on claims for reimbursement submitted by a provider for medically necessary services for which the provider has obtained prior authorization from the commission or a contractor of the commission unless the office has evidence that the provider has materially misrepresented documentation relating to those services. 
    
    (h)  In addition to performing functions and duties otherwise provided by law, the office may:
    
    (1)  assess administrative penalties otherwise authorized by law on behalf of the commission or a health and human services agency;
    
    (2)  request that the attorney general obtain an injunction to prevent a person from disposing of an asset identified by the office as potentially subject to recovery by the office due to the person's fraud or abuse;
    
    (3)  provide for coordination between the office and special investigative units formed by managed care organizations under Section [531.113](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=531.113) or entities with which managed care organizations contract under that section;
    
    (4)  audit the use and effectiveness of state or federal funds, including contract and grant funds, administered by a person or state agency receiving the funds from a health and human services agency;
    
    (5)  conduct investigations relating to the funds described by Subdivision (4);  and
    
    (6)  recommend policies promoting economical and efficient administration of the funds described by Subdivision (4) and the prevention and detection of fraud and abuse in administration of those funds.
    
    (i)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a reference in law or rule to the commission's office of investigations and enforcement means the office of inspector general established under this section.
    
    (j)  The office shall prepare a final report on each audit, inspection, or investigation conducted under this section.  The final report must include:
    
    (1)  a summary of the activities performed by the office in conducting the audit, inspection, or investigation;
    
    (2)  a statement regarding whether the audit, inspection, or investigation resulted in a finding of any wrongdoing; and
    
    (3)  a description of any findings of wrongdoing.
    
    (k)  A final report on an audit, inspection, or investigation is subject to required disclosure under Chapter [552](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552).  All information and materials compiled during the audit, inspection, or investigation remain confidential and not subject to required disclosure in accordance with Section [531.1021](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=531.1021)(g).  A confidential draft report on an audit, inspection, or investigation that concerns the death of a child may be shared with the Department of Family and Protective Services.  A draft report that is shared with the Department of Family and Protective Services remains confidential and is not subject to disclosure under Chapter [552](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552).
    
    (l)  The office shall employ a medical director who is a licensed physician under Subtitle B, Title 3, Occupations Code, and the rules adopted under that subtitle by the Texas Medical Board, and who preferably has significant knowledge of Medicaid.  The medical director shall ensure that any investigative findings based on medical necessity or the quality of medical care have been reviewed by a qualified expert as described by the Texas Rules of Evidence before the office imposes a payment hold or seeks recoupment of an overpayment, damages, or penalties.
    
    (m)  The office shall employ a dental director who is a licensed dentist under Subtitle D, Title 3, Occupations Code, and the rules adopted under that subtitle by the State Board of Dental Examiners, and who preferably has significant knowledge of Medicaid.  The dental director shall ensure that any investigative findings based on the necessity of dental services or the quality of dental care have been reviewed by a qualified expert as described by the Texas Rules of Evidence before the office imposes a payment hold or seeks recoupment of an overpayment, damages, or penalties.
    
    (m-1)  If the commission does not receive any responsive bids under Chapter [2155](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2155) on a competitive solicitation for the services of a qualified expert to review investigative findings under Subsection (l) or (m) and the number of contracts to be awarded under this subsection is not otherwise limited, the commission may negotiate with and award a contract for the services to a qualified expert on the basis of:
    
    (1)  the contractor's agreement to a set fee, either as a range or lump-sum amount; and 
    
    (2)  the contractor's affirmation and the office's verification that the contractor possesses the necessary occupational licenses and experience.
    
    (m-2)  Notwithstanding Sections [2155.083](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2155.083) and [2261.051](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2261.051), a contract awarded under Subsection (m-1) is not subject to competitive advertising and proposal evaluation requirements.
    
    (n)  To the extent permitted under federal law, the executive commissioner, on behalf of the office, shall adopt rules establishing the criteria for initiating a full-scale fraud or abuse investigation, conducting the investigation, collecting evidence, accepting and approving a provider's request to post a surety bond to secure potential recoupments in lieu of a payment hold or other asset or payment guarantee, and establishing minimum training requirements for Medicaid provider fraud or abuse investigators.
    
    (o)  Nothing in this section limits the authority of any other state agency or governmental entity.
    
    (p)  The executive commissioner, in consultation with the office, shall adopt rules establishing criteria: 
    
    (1)  for opening a case;
    
    (2)  for prioritizing cases for the efficient management of the office's workload, including rules that direct the office to prioritize:
    
    (A)  provider cases according to the highest potential for recovery or risk to the state as indicated through the provider's volume of billings, the provider's history of noncompliance with the law, and identified fraud trends;
    
    (B)  recipient cases according to the highest potential for recovery and federal timeliness requirements; and
    
    (C)  internal affairs investigations according to the seriousness of the threat to recipient safety and the risk to program integrity in terms of the amount or scope of fraud, waste, and abuse posed by the allegation that is the subject of the investigation; and  
    
    (3)  to guide field investigators in closing a case that is not worth pursuing through a full investigation.
    
    (q)  The office shall coordinate all audit and oversight activities, including the development of audit plans, risk assessments, and findings, with the commission to minimize the duplication of activities.  In coordinating activities under this subsection, the office shall:
    
    (1)  on an annual basis, seek input from the commission and consider previous audits and onsite visits made by the commission for purposes of determining whether to audit a managed care organization participating in Medicaid; and
    
    (2)  request the results of any informal audit or onsite visit performed by the commission that could inform the office's risk assessment when determining whether to conduct, or the scope of, an audit of a managed care organization participating in Medicaid.
    
    (r)  The office shall review the office's investigative process, including the office's use of sampling and extrapolation to audit provider records.  The review shall be performed by staff who are not directly involved in investigations conducted by the office.
    
    (s)  The office shall arrange for the Association of Inspectors General or a similar third party to conduct a peer review of the office's sampling and extrapolation techniques.  Based on the review and generally accepted practices among other offices of inspectors general, the executive commissioner, in consultation with the office, shall by rule adopt sampling and extrapolation standards to be used by the office in conducting audits. 
    
    (t)  At each quarterly meeting of any advisory council responsible for advising the executive commissioner on the operation of the commission, the inspector general shall submit a report to the executive commissioner, the governor, and the legislature on:
    
    (1)  the office's activities;
    
    (2)  the office's performance with respect to performance measures established by the executive commissioner for the office;
    
    (3)  fraud trends identified by the office;
    
    (4)  any recommendations for changes in policy to prevent or address fraud, waste, and abuse in the delivery of health and human services in this state; and
    
    (5)  the amount of money recovered during the preceding quarter as a result of investigations involving peace officers employed and commissioned by the office for each program for which the office has investigative authority.
    
    (u)  The office shall publish each report required under Subsection (t) on the office's Internet website.
    
    (v)  In accordance with Section [533.015](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=533.015)(b), the office shall consult with the executive commissioner regarding the adoption of rules defining the office's role in and jurisdiction over, and the frequency of, audits of managed care organizations participating in Medicaid that are conducted by the office and the commission.
    
    (w)  The office shall coordinate all audit and oversight activities relating to providers, including the development of audit plans, risk assessments, and findings, with the commission to minimize the duplication of activities.  In coordinating activities under this subsection, the office shall:
    
    (1)  on an annual basis, seek input from the commission and consider previous audits and on-site visits made by the commission for purposes of determining whether to audit a managed care organization participating in Medicaid; and
    
    (2)  request the results of any informal audit or on-site visit performed by the commission that could inform the office's risk assessment when determining whether to conduct, or the scope of, an audit of a managed care organization participating in Medicaid.
    
    (x)  The executive commissioner, in consultation with the office, shall adopt rules establishing criteria for determining enforcement and punitive actions with regard to a provider who has violated state law, program rules, or the provider's Medicaid provider agreement that include:

    (f)  On a quarterly basis, the office must request a certification from the state's Medicaid fraud control unit and other law enforcement agencies as to whether each matter accepted by the unit or agency on the basis of a credible allegation of fraud referral continues to be under investigation and that the continuation of the payment hold is warranted.

    (3)  a department employee.
    
    (b)  An institution in which a child's parent or guardian is considering placing the child may provide information required under Subsection (a), but the information must also be provided by a local intellectual and developmental disability authority, private entity, or employee of the Department of Aging and Disability Services as required by Subsection (a).

    (4)  that an ongoing permanency planning process is required under this subchapter and other state law.
    
    (d)  Except as otherwise provided by this subsection and Subsection (e), the Department of Aging and Disability Services shall ensure that, not later than the 14th working day after the date the department is notified of a request for the placement of a child in an institution, the child's parent or guardian is provided the information described by Subsections (a) and (c).  The department may provide the information after the 14th working day after the date the department is notified of the request if the child's parent or guardian waives the requirement that the information be provided within the period otherwise required by this subsection.
    
    (e)  The requirements of this section do not apply to a request for the placement of a child in an institution if the child:
    
    (1)  is involved in an emergency situation, as defined by rules adopted by the executive commissioner; or
    
    (2)  has been committed to an institution under Chapter [46B](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=46B), Code of Criminal Procedure, or Chapter [55](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=55), Family Code.

    (2)  the best interest of the child.
    
    (e)  The commission, the Department of Aging and Disability Services, and the Department of Family and Protective Services may solicit and accept gifts, grants, and donations to support the development of permanency plans for children residing in institutions by individuals or organizations not employed by or affiliated with those institutions.

    Sec. 531.159.  MONITORING OF PERMANENCY PLANNING EFFORTS.  (a)  The commission and each appropriate health and human services agency shall require a person who develops a permanency plan for a child residing in an institution to identify and document in the child's permanency plan all ongoing permanency planning efforts at least semiannually to ensure that, as soon as possible, the child will benefit from a permanent living arrangement with an enduring and nurturing parental relationship.
    
    (b)  The chief executive officer of each appropriate health and human services agency or the officer's designee must approve the placement of a child in an institution.  The initial placement of the child in the institution is temporary and may not exceed six months unless the appropriate chief executive officer or the officer's designee approves an extension of an additional six months after conducting a review of documented permanency planning efforts to unite the child with a family in a permanent living arrangement.  After the initial six-month extension of a child's placement in an institution approved under this subsection, the chief executive officer or the officer's designee shall conduct a review of the child's placement in the institution at least semiannually to determine whether a continuation of that placement is warranted.  If, based on the review, the chief executive officer or the officer's designee determines that an additional extension is warranted, the officer or the officer's designee shall recommend to the executive commissioner that the child continue residing in the institution.
    
    (c)  On receipt of a recommendation made under Subsection (b) for an extension of a child's placement, the executive commissioner, the executive commissioner's designee, or another person with whom the commission contracts shall conduct a review of the child's placement.  Based on the results of the review, the executive commissioner or the executive commissioner's designee may approve a six-month extension of the child's placement if the extension is appropriate.
    
    (d)  The child may continue residing in the institution after the six-month extension approved under Subsection (c) only if the chief executive officer of the appropriate health and human services agency or the officer's designee makes subsequent recommendations as provided by Subsection (b) for each additional six-month extension and the executive commissioner or the executive commissioner's designee approves each extension as provided by Subsection (c).
    
    (e)  The executive commissioner or the executive commissioner's designee shall conduct a semiannual review of data received from health and human services agencies regarding all children who reside in institutions in this state.  The executive commissioner, the executive commissioner's designee, or a person with whom the commission contracts shall also review the recommendations of the chief executive officers of each appropriate health and human services agency or the officer's designee if the officer or the officer's designee repeatedly recommends that children continue residing in an institution.
    
    (f)  The executive commissioner by rule shall develop procedures by which to conduct the reviews required by Subsections (c), (d), and (e).  In developing the procedures, the commission may seek input from the work group on children's long-term services, health services, and mental health services established under Section 22.035, Human Resources Code.

    Sec. 531.502.  DIRECTION TO OBTAIN FEDERAL WAIVER.  (a)  The executive commissioner may seek a waiver under Section 1115 of the federal Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. Section 1315) to the state Medicaid plan to allow the commission to more efficiently and effectively use federal money paid to this state under various programs to defray costs associated with providing uncompensated health care in this state by using that federal money, appropriated state money to the extent necessary, and any other money described by this section for purposes consistent with this subchapter.
    
    (b)  The executive commissioner may include the following federal money in the waiver:
    
    (1)  money provided under the disproportionate share hospitals or upper payment limit supplemental payment program, or both;
    
    (2)  money provided by the federal government in lieu of some or all of the payments under one or both of those programs;
    
    (3)  any combination of funds authorized to be pooled by Subdivisions (1) and (2); and
    
    (4)  any other money available for that purpose, including:
    
    (A)  federal money and money identified under Subsection (c);
    
    (B)  gifts, grants, or donations for that purpose;
    
    (C)  local funds received by this state through intergovernmental transfers; and
    
    (D)  if approved in the waiver, federal money obtained through the use of certified public expenditures.
    
    (c)  The commission shall seek to optimize federal funding by:
    
    (1)  identifying health care related state and local funds and program expenditures that, before September 1, 2011, are not being matched with federal money; and
    
    (2)  exploring the feasibility of:
    
    (A)  certifying or otherwise using those funds and expenditures as state expenditures for which this state may receive federal matching money; and
    
    (B)  depositing federal matching money received as provided by Paragraph (A) with other federal money deposited as provided by Section [531.504](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=531.504), or substituting that federal matching money for federal money that otherwise would be received under the disproportionate share hospitals and upper payment limit supplemental payment programs as a match for local funds received by this state through intergovernmental transfers.
    
    (d)  The terms of a waiver approved under this section must:
    
    (1)  include safeguards to ensure that the total amount of federal money provided under the disproportionate share hospitals or upper payment limit supplemental payment program that is deposited as provided by Section [531.504](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=531.504) is, for a particular state fiscal year, at least equal to the greater of the annualized amount provided to this state under those supplemental payment programs during state fiscal year 2011, excluding amounts provided during that state fiscal year that are retroactive payments, or the state fiscal years during which the waiver is in effect; and
    
    (2)  allow for the development by this state of a methodology for allocating money in the fund to:
    
    (A)  be used to supplement Medicaid hospital reimbursements under a waiver that includes terms that are consistent with, or that produce revenues consistent with, disproportionate share hospital and upper payment limit principles;
    
    (B)  reduce the number of persons in this state who do not have health benefits coverage; and
    
    (C)  maintain and enhance the community public health infrastructure provided by hospitals.
    
    (e)  In a waiver under this section, the executive commissioner shall seek to:
    
    (1)  obtain maximum flexibility with respect to using the money in the fund for purposes consistent with this subchapter;
    
    (2)  include an annual adjustment to the aggregate caps under the upper payment limit supplemental payment program to account for inflation, population growth, and other appropriate demographic factors that affect the ability of residents of this state to obtain health benefits coverage;
    
    (3)  ensure, for the term of the waiver, that the aggregate caps under the upper payment limit supplemental payment program for each of the three classes of hospitals are not less than the aggregate caps that applied during state fiscal year 2007; and
    
    (4)  to the extent allowed by federal law, including federal regulations, and federal waiver authority, preserve the federal supplemental payment program payments made to hospitals, the state match with respect to which is funded by intergovernmental transfers or certified public expenditures that are used to optimize Medicaid payments to safety net providers for uncompensated care, and preserve allocation methods for those payments, unless the need for the payments is revised through measures that reduce the Medicaid shortfall or uncompensated care costs.
    
    (f)  The executive commissioner shall seek broad-based stakeholder input in the development of the waiver under this section and shall provide information to stakeholders regarding the terms and components of the waiver for which the executive commissioner seeks federal approval.

    Text of section effective until April 01, 2025
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 531.551.  UNCOMPENSATED HOSPITAL CARE REPORTING AND ANALYSIS.  (a)  The executive commissioner shall adopt rules providing for:
    
    (1)  a standard definition of "uncompensated hospital care";
    
    (2)  a methodology to be used by hospitals in this state to compute the cost of that care that incorporates a standard set of adjustments to a hospital's initial computation of the cost of uncompensated hospital care that account for all funding streams that:
    
    (A)  are not patient-specific; and
    
    (B)  are used to offset the hospital's initially computed amount of uncompensated care; and
    
    (3)  procedures to be used by those hospitals to report the cost of that care to the commission and to analyze that cost.
    
    (b)  The rules adopted by the executive commissioner under Subsection (a)(3) may provide for procedures by which the commission may periodically verify the completeness and accuracy of the information reported by hospitals.
    
    (c)  The commission shall notify the attorney general of a hospital's failure to report the cost of uncompensated care on or before the date the report was due in accordance with rules adopted under Subsection (a)(3).  On receipt of the notice, the attorney general shall impose an administrative penalty on the hospital in the amount of $1,000 for each day after the date the report was due that the hospital has not submitted the report, not to exceed $10,000.
    
    (d)  If the commission determines through the procedures adopted under Subsection (b) that a hospital submitted a report with incomplete or inaccurate information, the commission shall notify the hospital of the specific information the hospital must submit and prescribe a date by which the hospital must provide that information.  If the hospital fails to submit the specified information on or before the date prescribed by the commission, the commission shall notify the attorney general of that failure.  On receipt of the notice, the attorney general shall impose an administrative penalty on the hospital in an amount not to exceed $10,000.  In determining the amount of the penalty to be imposed, the attorney general shall consider:
    
    (1)  the seriousness of the violation;
    
    (2)  whether the hospital had previously committed a violation; and
    
    (3)  the amount necessary to deter the hospital from committing future violations.
    
    (e)  A report by the commission to the attorney general under Subsection (c) or (d) must state the facts on which the commission based its determination that the hospital failed to submit a report or failed to completely and accurately report information, as applicable.
    
    (f)  The attorney general shall give written notice of the commission's report to the hospital alleged to have failed to comply with a requirement.  The notice must include a brief summary of the alleged violation, a statement of the amount of the administrative penalty to be imposed, and a statement of the hospital's right to a hearing on the alleged violation, the amount of the penalty, or both.
    
    (g)  Not later than the 20th day after the date the notice is sent under Subsection (f), the hospital must make a written request for a hearing or remit the amount of the administrative penalty to the attorney general.  Failure to timely request a hearing or remit the amount of the administrative penalty results in a waiver of the right to a hearing under this section.  If the hospital timely requests a hearing, the attorney general shall conduct the hearing in accordance with Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code.  If the hearing results in a finding that a violation has occurred, the attorney general shall:
    
    (1)  provide to the hospital written notice of:
    
    (A)  the findings established at the hearing; and
    
    (B)  the amount of the penalty; and
    
    (2)  enter an order requiring the hospital to pay the amount of the penalty.
    
    (h)  Not later than the 30th day after the date the hospital receives the order entered by the attorney general under Subsection (g), the hospital shall:
    
    (1)  pay the amount of the administrative penalty;
    
    (2)  remit the amount of the penalty to the attorney general for deposit in an escrow account and file a petition for judicial review contesting the occurrence of the violation, the amount of the penalty, or both; or
    
    (3)  without paying the amount of the penalty, file a petition for judicial review contesting the occurrence of the violation, the amount of the penalty, or both and file with the court a sworn affidavit stating that the hospital is financially unable to pay the amount of the penalty.
    
    (i)  The attorney general's order is subject to judicial review as a contested case under Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code.
    
    (j)  If the hospital paid the penalty and on review the court does not sustain the occurrence of the violation or finds that the amount of the administrative penalty should be reduced, the attorney general shall remit the appropriate amount to the hospital not later than the 30th day after the date the court's judgment becomes final.
    
    (k)  If the court sustains the occurrence of the violation:
    
    (1)  the court:
    
    (A)  shall order the hospital to pay the amount of the administrative penalty; and
    
    (B)  may award to the attorney general the attorney's fees and court costs incurred by the attorney general in defending the action; and
    
    (2)  the attorney general shall remit the amount of the penalty to the comptroller for deposit in the general revenue fund.
    
    (l)  If the hospital does not pay the amount of the administrative penalty after the attorney general's order becomes final for all purposes, the attorney general may enforce the penalty as provided by law for legal judgments.
