    Sec. 2311.002.  COMBINED HEATING AND POWER SYSTEMS.  (a)  When constructing or extensively renovating a critical governmental facility or replacing major heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning equipment for a critical governmental facility, the entity with charge and control of the facility shall evaluate whether equipping the facility with a combined heating and power system would result in expected energy savings that would exceed the expected costs of purchasing, operating, and maintaining the system over a 20-year period.  Notwithstanding Chapter [2302](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2302), the entity may equip the facility with a combined heating and power system if the expected energy savings exceed the expected costs.
