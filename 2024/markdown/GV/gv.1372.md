(a)  The maximum amount of the state ceiling that may be reserved before August 15 by a housing finance corporation for the issuance of qualified mortgage bonds may not exceed the amount computed as follows:
    
    (1)  if the local population of the housing finance corporation is 300,000 or more, $36 million plus the product of the amount by which the local population exceeds 300,000 multiplied by $40;
    
    (2)  if the local population of the housing finance corporation is 200,000 or more but less than 300,000, $32 million plus the product of the amount by which the local population exceeds 200,000 multiplied by $40;
    
    (3)  if the local population of the housing finance corporation is 100,000 or more but less than 200,000, $24 million plus the product of the amount by which the local population exceeds 100,000 multiplied by $80; or
    
    (4)  if the local population of the housing finance corporation is less than 100,000, the product of the local population multiplied by $240.
    
    (b)  A housing finance corporation may not receive an allocation for the issuance of qualified mortgage bonds in an amount that exceeds the greater of:
    
    (1)  $50 million; or
    
    (2)  1.70 percent of the state ceiling.
    
    (c)  For purposes of this section, the local population of a housing finance corporation is the population of the local government or local governments on whose behalf a housing finance corporation is created.  If two local governments that have a population of at least 50,000 each and that have overlapping territory have created housing finance corporations that have the power to issue bonds to provide financing for home mortgages, the population of the housing finance corporation created on behalf of the larger local government is computed by subtracting from the population of the larger local government the population of the part of the smaller local government that is located in the larger local government.  The reduction of population provided by this subsection is not required if the smaller local government assigns its authority to issue bonds, based on its population, to the larger local government.

    Sec. 1372.0261.  FAILURE OF HOUSING FINANCE CORPORATION TO USE AMOUNT OF STATE CEILING ALLOCATED.  (a)  In this section, "utilization percentage" means that portion of the amount of the state ceiling allocated to a housing finance corporation with respect to which the corporation issues private activity bonds that result in mortgage loans or mortgage credit certificates.  A housing finance corporation's utilization percentage for an allocation of the state ceiling is the quotient of:
    
    (1)  the amount of the state ceiling:
    
    (A)  with respect to which mortgage loans have been originated, considering only the original principal balance of those loans;
    
    (B)  that is used to purchase mortgages or mortgage-backed securities; or
    
    (C)  that is used to issue mortgage credit certificates; divided by
    
    (2)  the amount of the state ceiling allocated, minus any amounts of the state ceiling required for debt service reserve funds.
    
    (b)  If a housing finance corporation's issue of bonds uses a new allocation of the state ceiling in combination with taxable bond proceeds or with bond proceeds recycled from previous allocations of the state ceiling, the first loans or certificates financed are considered in computing the utilization percentage of the new allocation of the state ceiling.
    
    (c)  If a housing finance corporation's utilization percentage is less than 80 percent but at least 25 percent, the next time the corporation becomes eligible for a reservation of the state ceiling, the maximum amount of the state ceiling that may be reserved for the corporation is equal to the amount for which the corporation would otherwise be eligible under Section [1372.026](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=1372.026) multiplied by the utilization percentage of the corporation's last bond issue that used an allocation of the state ceiling.
    
    (d)  A housing finance corporation may not be penalized under Subsection (c) if:
    
    (1)  the corporation fails to use:
    
    (A)  bond proceeds recycled from previous allocations of the state ceiling; or
    
    (B)  taxable bond proceeds;
    
    (2)  as the result of an issuance of bonds, the corporation's utilization percentage is 80 percent or greater; or
    
    (3)  the application is received after July 14.
    
    (e)  If a housing finance corporation's utilization percentage is less than 25 percent, the next time the corporation becomes eligible for a reservation of the state ceiling, the maximum amount of the state ceiling that may be reserved for the corporation is equal to the amount for which the corporation would otherwise be eligible under Section [1372.026](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=1372.026) multiplied by 25 percent.
    
    (f)  A housing finance corporation may not be penalized under Subsection (c) in a program year if, by December 31 of the preceding program year, an amount equal to or less than 50 percent of the aggregate state ceiling available for reservations by issuers of qualified mortgage bonds under Section [1372.022](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=1372.022)(a)(1):
    
    (1)  has been used in connection with bond issues that have closed on or before that date; or
    
    (2)  has had carryforward elections filed on or before that date.
    
    (g)  An issuer that has carryforward available from the additional state ceiling is not restricted by project limits for the state ceiling.  An issuer who uses the carryforward to issue qualified mortgage bonds or mortgage credit certificates is not subject to the utilization percentage calculation in determining the amount of the issuer's reservation request.

(a)  If, on or before October 20, more than one housing finance corporation applies for a reservation of the state ceiling for qualified mortgage bonds for the next program year, the board shall give priority in granting reservations in that category to issuers that:
    
    (1)  applied before September 1 of the preceding year for a reservation on behalf of the same local population for that year;  but
    
    (2)  were not granted a reservation during that year.

    (c)  Within the group of issuers given priority and within the group not given priority, the board shall grant reservations in reverse order of the date of the most recent closing of qualified mortgage bonds applicable to the housing finance corporations, with a corporation that has never received a reservation for mortgage revenue bonds being the first to receive a reservation and the corporation that had the most recent closing being the last to receive a reservation.  If closings occurred on the same date, the board shall grant reservations in the order determined by the board by lot.
    
    (d)  For purposes of Subsection (c), the most recent closing applicable to a newly created housing finance corporation sponsored by one or more local governments that had previously sponsored another housing finance corporation, whether existing or not, or to a housing finance corporation sponsored by a local government that has participated in the program of another housing finance corporation is the most recent closing of qualified mortgage bonds the proceeds of which were available to the population of the corporation.
    
    (e)  A housing finance corporation or its sponsoring local government may not achieve an advantage in the determination of its most recent closing by creating, dissolving, or withdrawing from a housing finance corporation.
