    Sec. 544.0152.  EXCHANGE OF CRIMINAL HISTORY RECORD INFORMATION BETWEEN PARTICIPATING AGENCIES.  (a)  This section applies only to:
    
    (1)  criminal history record information a participating agency holds that relates to a health care professional; and
    
    (2)  information a participating agency holds that relates to a health care professional or managed care organization that is the subject of an investigation by a participating agency for alleged Medicaid fraud or abuse.
    
    (b)  A participating agency may submit to another participating agency a written request for information to which this section applies.  The participating agency that receives the request shall provide the requesting agency with the requested information unless releasing the information:
    
    (1)  would jeopardize an ongoing investigation or prosecution by the participating agency that possesses the information; or
    
    (2)  is prohibited by other law.
    
    (c)  Notwithstanding any other law, a participating agency may enter into a memorandum of understanding or agreement with another participating agency for exchanging criminal history record information relating to a health care professional that both participating agencies are authorized access to under Chapter [411](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=411).  Confidential criminal history record information in a participating agency's possession that is provided to another participating agency remains confidential while in the possession of the participating agency that receives the information.
    
    (d)  A participating agency that discovers information that may indicate fraud or abuse by a health care professional or managed care organization may provide the information to any other participating agency unless the release of the information is prohibited by other law.
    
    (e)  If after receiving a request for information under Subsection (b) a participating agency determines that the agency is prohibited from releasing the information, the agency shall, not later than the 30th day after the date the agency received the request, inform the requesting agency of that determination in writing.
    
    (f)  Confidential information shared under this section is subject to the same confidentiality requirements and legal restrictions on access to the information that are imposed by law on the participating agency that originally obtained or collected the information.  Sharing information under this section does not affect whether the information is subject to disclosure under Chapter [552](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552).
    
    (g)  A participating agency that receives information from another participating agency under this section must obtain written permission from the agency that shared the information before using the information in a licensure or enforcement action.
    
    (h)  This section does not affect a participating agency's authority to exchange information under other law.

    Sec. 544.0153.  PROVIDER ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICAID PARTICIPATION: CRIMINAL HISTORY RECORD INFORMATION.  (a)  The office of inspector general and each licensing authority that requires the submission of fingerprints to conduct a criminal history record information check of a health care professional shall enter into a memorandum of understanding to ensure that only individuals who are licensed and in good standing as health care professionals participate as Medicaid providers.  The memorandum under this section may be combined with a memorandum authorized under Section [544.0152](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=544.0152)(c) and must include a process by which:
    
    (1)  to determine a health care professional's eligibility to participate in Medicaid, the office may confirm with a licensing authority that the professional is licensed and in good standing; and
    
    (2)  the licensing authority immediately notifies the office if:
    
    (A)  a provider's license has been revoked or suspended; or
    
    (B)  the licensing authority has taken disciplinary action against a provider.
    
    (b)  To determine a health care professional's eligibility to participate as a Medicaid provider, the office of inspector general may not conduct a criminal history record information check of a health care professional who the office has confirmed under Subsection (a) is licensed and in good standing.  This subsection does not prohibit the office from conducting a criminal history record information check of a provider that is required or appropriate for other reasons, including for conducting an investigation of fraud, waste, or abuse.
    
    (c)  To determine a provider's eligibility to participate in Medicaid and subject to Subsection (d), the office of inspector general, after seeking public input, shall establish and the executive commissioner by rule shall adopt guidelines for evaluating criminal history record information of providers and potential providers.  The guidelines must outline conduct, by provider type, that may be contained in criminal history record information that will result in excluding a person as a Medicaid provider, taking into consideration:
    
    (1)  the extent to which the underlying conduct relates to the services provided through Medicaid;
    
    (2)  the degree to which the person would interact with Medicaid recipients as a provider; and
    
    (3)  any previous evidence that the person engaged in Medicaid fraud, waste, or abuse.
    
    (d)  The guidelines adopted under Subsection (c) may not impose stricter standards for an individual's eligibility to participate in Medicaid than a licensing authority described by Subsection (a) requires for the individual to engage in a health care profession without restriction in this state.
    
    (e)  The office of inspector general and the commission shall use the guidelines the executive commissioner adopts under Subsection (c) to determine whether a Medicaid provider continues to be eligible to participate as a Medicaid provider.
    
    (f)  The provider enrollment contractor, if applicable, and a Medicaid managed care organization shall defer to the office of inspector general on whether an individual's criminal history record information precludes the individual from participating as a Medicaid provider.

    (1)  information concerning the health care professional's licensing status obtained as described by Section [544.0153](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=544.0153)(a);

    Sec. 544.0301.  IMPOSITION OF PAYMENT HOLD.  (a)  As authorized by state and federal law and except as provided by Subsections (d) and (e), the office of inspector general shall impose, as a serious enforcement tool to mitigate ongoing financial risk to this state, a payment hold on claims for reimbursement submitted by a provider only:
    
    (1)  to compel production of records;
    
    (2)  when requested by this state's Medicaid fraud control unit; or
    
    (3)  on the determination that a credible allegation of fraud exists, subject to Sections [544.0104](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=544.0104)(b) and [544.0105](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=544.0105)(b), as applicable.
    
    (b)  The office of inspector general shall impose a payment hold under this section without prior notice, and the payment hold takes effect immediately.
    
    (c)  The office of inspector general shall, in consultation with this state's Medicaid fraud control unit, establish guidelines regarding the imposition of payment holds authorized under this section.
    
    (d)  On the determination that a credible allegation of fraud exists and in accordance with 42 C.F.R. Sections 455.23(e) and (f), the office of inspector general may find that good cause exists to not impose a payment hold, to not continue a payment hold, to impose a payment hold only in part, or to convert a payment hold imposed in whole to one imposed only in part if:
    
    (1)  law enforcement officials specifically requested that a payment hold not be imposed because a payment hold would compromise or jeopardize an investigation;
    
    (2)  available remedies implemented by this state other than a payment hold would more effectively or quickly protect Medicaid funds;
    
    (3)  the office of inspector general determines, based on the submission of written evidence by the provider who is the subject of the payment hold, that the payment hold should be removed;
    
    (4)  Medicaid recipients' access to items or services would be jeopardized by a full or partial payment hold because the provider who is the subject of the payment hold:
    
    (A)  is the sole community physician or the sole source of essential specialized services in a community; or
    
    (B)  serves a large number of Medicaid recipients within a designated medically underserved area;
    
    (5)  the attorney general declines to certify that a matter continues to be under investigation; or
    
    (6)  the office of inspector general determines that a full or partial payment hold is not in the best interests of Medicaid.
    
    (e)  Unless the office of inspector general has evidence that a provider materially misrepresented documentation relating to medically necessary services, the office of inspector general may not impose a payment hold on claims for reimbursement the provider submits for those services if the provider obtained prior authorization from the commission or a commission contractor.
