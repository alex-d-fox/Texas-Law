    Sec. 401.001.  INAUGURAL COMMITTEE.  (a)  Not later than the 10th day after the date of each election for governor and lieutenant governor, the secretary of state shall issue a proclamation stating who, in the secretary of state's opinion based on the best information then available, are the governor-elect and lieutenant governor-elect.  The secretary of state shall promptly deliver certified copies of the proclamation to the individuals named in the proclamation.
    
    (b)  As soon as possible after receiving notice of the proclamation, the governor-elect and lieutenant governor-elect shall each file with the secretary of state a signed instrument.  The governor-elect shall designate in that instrument one individual to serve as chairman of the inaugural committee and one individual to serve as a cochairman of the committee.  The lieutenant governor-elect shall designate in that instrument one individual to serve as a cochairman of the committee.  The governor-elect and lieutenant governor-elect may appoint by written instrument filed with the secretary of state other members to the inaugural committee as they consider necessary.  An individual who holds a position of profit under this state or the United States is ineligible for appointment to the committee.
    
    (c)  If after issuing a proclamation under this section the secretary of state becomes aware of information that indicates that the previous designation of governor-elect or lieutenant governor-elect was incorrect, the secretary of state shall issue a corrected proclamation and deliver certified copies of it to the previous designee, the new designee, and each member of the inaugural committee appointed by the previous designee.  Issuance of a corrected proclamation terminates the membership on the inaugural committee of appointees of the previous designee but does not affect an action taken by the committee before the proclamation was issued.  As soon as possible after the new designee receives notice of designation as governor-elect or lieutenant governor-elect, the designee shall make the appropriate appointments under this section.
    
    (d)  A vacancy on the committee is filled by appointment by the original appointing authority according to the procedure applicable to original appointments.
