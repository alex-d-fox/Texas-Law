    (c)  The prior service credit is an amount computed as a percentage determined as provided by Subsection (d) or, if applicable, Subsection (d-1), times a base credit equal to the accumulation at three percent interest of a series of monthly amounts for the number of months of approved prior service, times the sum of:
    
    (1)  the rate of contributions required of employees of the municipality for current service; plus
    
    (2)  the rate described in Subdivision (1) times the municipal current service matching ratio.
    
    (d)  The governing body of a municipality shall determine in the ordinance providing for participation the percentage to be applied against the base credit in computing a prior service credit under Subsection (c).  Except as provided by Subsection (d-1), the percentage adopted may be any multiple of 10 percent that does not exceed 100 percent of the base credit, with 10 percent being the minimum percentage a municipality may adopt.  A governing body may not adopt a percentage under this subsection until the actuary first determines, and the retirement system concurs in the determination, that the municipality is able to fund, before the 30th anniversary of the effective date of its participation in the retirement system, all prior service obligations that the municipality proposes to assume under this section.
    
    (d-1)  The governing body of a municipality shall adopt, by ordinance, a zero percent prior service credit if, before joining the retirement system, the municipality provided retirement benefits to its employees that were funded partly or wholly by the municipality.  Prior service credit adopted under this subsection is excluded prior service credit.
    
    (e)  The prior service credit of a person who becomes a member of the retirement system under Section [852.105](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=852.105) or who is entitled to prior service credit under Section [853.102](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=853.102)(a)(3) is computed on the percentage of the base prior service credit that was most recently used by the person's employing municipality in computing prior or updated service credits for current employees.
    
    (f)  Interest on a prior service credit is earned for each whole calendar year beginning on the effective date of membership and ending on the effective date of retirement.  If a person retires under this subtitle on a date other than December 31, interest on a prior service credit is earned for the partial year in which the retirement occurs, prorated from January 1 of the year in which the retirement occurs to the effective date of retirement.

    (c)  As soon as practicable after the municipality receives a report under Subsection (b), the municipality shall verify the information in the report and certify to the retirement system the number of months of probationary employment to which each employee listed on the report appears to be entitled and the average monthly compensation paid to the member during the period of probationary employment.
    
    (d)  The certification by the municipality must be received by the retirement system not later than the first anniversary of the effective date of the ordinance allowing the credit.  After receiving the certification from the municipality described by Subsection (c), the board of trustees shall determine the prior service credit allowable to the member in the manner provided in Section [853.105](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=853.105).

    Sec. 853.305.  CREDIT FOR SERVICE WITH NONPARTICIPATING MUNICIPALITY, AIRPORT AUTHORITY, OR COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS, OR CERTAIN SERVICE PREVIOUSLY CANCELED.  (a)  The governing body of a participating municipality by ordinance may authorize the granting of restricted prior service credit to an employee who is a member of the retirement system for service previously performed:
    
    (1)  as a full-time, paid employee of the United States, of any public authority or agency created by the United States, of any state or territory of the United States, of any political subdivision of any state of the United States, of any public agency or authority created by a state or territory of the United States, or of an institution of higher education at which the person is commissioned as a campus security personnel employee under Section [51.212](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=51.212), Education Code, and for which service the person has not otherwise received credited service in this system, including combined service credit under Chapter 803;  or
    
    (2)  as an employee of the state or any branch, agency, or subdivision of the state for which the person received credited service under the Employees Retirement System of Texas, the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, the Judicial Retirement System of Texas Plan One, the Judicial Retirement System of Texas Plan Two, the Texas County and District Retirement System, or this retirement system, and the credit for which was canceled because of withdrawal of contributions and has not been reinstated.
    
    (b)  Restricted prior service credit may be used only to satisfy length-of-service requirements for retirement eligibility, has no monetary value in computing the annuity payments allowable to the member, and may not be used in other computations, including computation of updated service credits.
    
    (c)  A member seeking to establish restricted prior service credit under Subsection (a)(1) must obtain from the official custodian of personnel records of the entity for which the previous service was performed a detailed statement of the service, verified by that official, and file the statement with the clerk or secretary of the participating municipality by which the member is employed.  A member seeking to establish restricted prior service credit under Subsection (a)(2) must obtain from the public retirement system in which the canceled service was credited a detailed statement of the service, verified by an official of that retirement system, and file that statement with the clerk or secretary of the participating municipality by which the member is employed.
    
    (d)  As soon as practicable after the member has filed the verified statement, the clerk or secretary of the participating municipality authorizing the credit shall examine the statement.  If satisfied that the claim is correct, the clerk or secretary shall endorse the statement as approved, file the original in the appropriate files of the granting municipality, and prepare and transmit to the director of the retirement system a certified copy of the approved claim.
    
    (e)  On receipt of a certified copy of an approved claim, the retirement system, if satisfied that credit for service claimed under Subsection (a)(1) has not previously been granted the member, or that credit claimed under Subsection (a)(2) previously existed but has been canceled and not reinstated, shall enter the credit in the member's records.
    
    (f)  In this section, "full-time, paid employee" has the meaning assigned "employee" by Section [851.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=851.001), except that the services do not have to be performed for a municipality.
    
    (g)  An ordinance adopted under this section applies to the granting of restricted prior service credit to a member who is or has been an employee of the authorizing municipality at any time on or after the effective date of the ordinance.

    Sec. 853.401.  ORDINANCE AUTHORIZING UPDATED SERVICE CREDITS.  (a)  Except as provided by Subsection (b) and Section [853.0015](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=853.0015), the governing body of a participating municipality by ordinance may authorize the crediting in the retirement system of updated service credits for service performed for the municipality by members.  Beginning January 1, 2022, a member must be a contributing employee of the municipality on the date prescribed by Section [853.402](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=853.402)(e) to be eligible to receive an updated service credit authorized under this section.  An updated service credit authorized under this section replaces any updated service credit or prior service credit previously authorized for part of the same service.
    
    (b)  A municipality may not authorize updated service credits for members who had less than 36 months of credited service on the date prescribed by Section [853.402](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=853.402)(e).

The percentage adopted may be 50 percent, 75 percent, or 100 percent of a base updated service credit.  The effective date must be January 1 of a year specified by the governing body.  If the governing body of a municipality has specified a different percentage in an ordinance adopted under Section [853.404](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=853.404)(a) and in effect on December 31, 1999, the percentage used in computing updated service credits for employees of that municipality remains in effect until changed or discontinued under Section [853.404](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=853.404).
    
    (d)  A governing body that adopts an ordinance under this section shall send it to the retirement system, and the system must receive it before the effective date of the updated service credits authorized in the ordinance.

    Sec. 853.402.  DETERMINATION OF UPDATED SERVICE CREDITS.  (a)  If a governing body sends the retirement system an ordinance adopted under Section [853.401](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=853.401), the retirement system shall determine for each affected member the average updated service compensation, base updated service credit, and updated service credit.
    
    (a-1)  The board of trustees by rule may limit the increase in a member's average updated service compensation from year to year.
    
    (b)  The average updated service compensation of a member is computed as the monthly average compensation:
    
    (1)  for the 36 months immediately preceding the date prescribed by Subsection (e);  or
    
    (2)  if the member did not perform service in each of the 36 months described in Subdivision (1) or did not perform any service within the 36-month period, for the most recent 36 months before the date prescribed by Subsection (e) in which the member performed service.
    
    (c)  The base updated service credit of a member is an amount computed as the number 1.03, times the difference by which the amount computed under Subdivision (1) exceeds the amount computed under Subdivision (2), where:
    
    (1)  "(1)" is an amount equal to the accumulation at three percent interest of a series of monthly amounts for the number of months of credited service on the date prescribed by Subsection (e), each amount of which equals the member's average updated service compensation, times the sum of:
    
    (A)  the rate of contributions required of the member for current service; plus
    
    (B)  the member's contribution rate, times the municipal current service ratio in effect on the effective date of the ordinance adopted under Section [853.401](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=853.401); and where
    
    (2)  "(2)" is an amount equal to the sum of:
    
    (A)  the amount credited to the member's individual account on the date prescribed by Subsection (e), subject to a 1 to 1 matching ratio, times 2; plus
    
    (B)  the amount credited to the member's individual account, subject to a 1.5 to 1 matching ratio, times 2.5; plus
    
    (C)  the amount credited to the member's individual account, subject to a 2 to 1 matching ratio, times 3.
    
    (d)  The updated service credit of a member is an amount equal to the greatest of the following:
    
    (1)  the percentage determined under Section [853.401](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=853.401)(c), times the member's base updated service credit;  or
    
    (2)  any updated service credit previously authorized by the municipality and in effect for the member, accumulated at interest as provided by Subsection (f) from the date it took effect to the date prescribed by Subsection (e);  or
    
    (3)  prior service credit previously authorized by the municipality and in effect for the member, accumulated at interest as provided by Subsection (f) from the date the credit took effect to the date prescribed by Subsection (e).
    
    (e)  The date used in computing updated service compensation and updated service credits under this section is January 1 of the year immediately preceding the January 1 on which the updated service credits will take effect.
    
    (f)  Interest on an updated service credit is earned for each whole calendar year beginning on the date the updated service credit takes effect and ending on the effective date of retirement.  If a person retires under this subtitle on a date other than December 31, interest on an updated service credit is earned for the partial year in which the retirement occurs, prorated from January 1 of the year in which the retirement occurs to the effective date of retirement.
    
    (g)  The retirement system may recalculate updated service credit for purposes of determining a member's retirement annuity if:
    
    (1)  the member reestablishes credited service in accordance with Section [853.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=853.003) and retires in the same calendar year; and
    
    (2)  any municipality for which the member performed creditable service adopts an ordinance authorizing updated service credits under Section [853.401](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=853.401), [853.404](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=853.404), or [853.601](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=853.601) with an effective date of January 1 of the same calendar year.

    (b)  The board of trustees may adopt rules it finds necessary to ensure that the retirement system receives in a timely manner from a municipality the certified information the actuary requires to make the necessary determinations before the date the updated service credits take effect.

    (b)  If the member is granted an updated service credit by a previously employing municipality on or after the granting of an updated service credit under Subsection (a), the updated service credit granted under Subsection (a) shall be reduced by the amount of increase in credits resulting from the granting of updated service credits by the previous employer.
