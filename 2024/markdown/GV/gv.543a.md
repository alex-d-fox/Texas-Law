    Sec. 543A.0002.  DEVELOPMENT OF OUTCOME AND PROCESS MEASURES; CORRELATION WITH INCREASED REIMBURSEMENT RATES. (a) The commission shall develop quality-based outcome and process measures that:
    
    (1)  promote the provision of efficient, quality health care; and
    
    (2)  can be used in the child health plan program and Medicaid to implement quality-based payments for acute care services and long-term services and supports across all delivery models and payment systems, including fee-for-service and managed care payment systems.
    
    (b)  The commission, in coordination with the Department of State Health Services, shall develop and implement a quality-based outcome measure for the child health plan program and Medicaid to annually measure the percentage of enrollees or recipients with HIV infection, regardless of age, whose most recent viral load test indicates a viral load of less than 200 copies per milliliter of blood.
    
    (c)  To the extent feasible, the commission shall develop outcome and process measures:
    
    (1)  consistently across all child health plan program and Medicaid delivery models and payment systems;
    
    (2)  in a manner that takes into account appropriate patient risk factors, including the burden of chronic illness on a patient and the severity of a patient's illness;
    
    (3)  that will have the greatest effect on improving quality of care and the efficient use of services, including acute care services and long-term services and supports;
    
    (4)  that are similar to outcome and process measures used in the private sector, as appropriate;
    
    (5)  that reflect effective coordination of acute care services and long-term services and supports;
    
    (6)  that can be tied to expenditures; and
    
    (7)  that reduce preventable health care utilization and costs.
    
    (d)  In developing the outcome and process measures, the commission must include measures that are based on potentially preventable events and advance quality improvement and innovation. The outcome measures based on potentially preventable events must:
    
    (1)  allow for a rate-based determination of health care provider performance compared to statewide norms; and
    
    (2)  be risk-adjusted to account for the severity of the illnesses of patients a provider serves.
    
    (e)  The commission may modify the outcome and process measures to:
    
    (1)  promote continuous system reform, improved quality, and reduced costs; and
    
    (2)  account for managed care organizations added to a service area.
    
    (f)  To the extent feasible, the commission shall align the outcome and process measures with measures required or recommended under reporting guidelines established by:
    
    (1)  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services;
    
    (2)  the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; or
    
    (3)  another federal agency.
    
    (g)  The executive commissioner by rule may require physicians, other health care providers, and managed care organizations participating in the child health plan program and Medicaid to report information necessary to develop the outcome and process measures to the commission in a format the executive commissioner specifies.
    
    (h)  If the commission increases physician and other health care provider reimbursement rates under the child health plan program or Medicaid as a result of an increase in the amounts appropriated for those programs for a state fiscal biennium as compared to the preceding state fiscal biennium, the commission shall, to the extent permitted under federal law and to the extent otherwise possible considering other relevant factors, correlate the increased reimbursement rates with the quality-based outcome and process measures.

    (b)  The commission shall develop the quality-based payment systems in the manner specified by this chapter.  To the extent necessary to maximize the receipt of federal funds or reduce administrative burdens, the commission shall coordinate the timeline for developing and implementing a payment system with the implementation of other initiatives such as:
    
    (1)  the Medicaid Information Technology Architecture (MITA) initiative of the Center for Medicaid and State Operations;
    
    (2)  the ICD-10 code sets initiative; or
    
    (3)  the ongoing Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) planning process.
    
    (c)  In developing the quality-based payment systems, the commission shall examine and consider implementing:
    
    (1)  an alternative payment system;
    
    (2)  an existing performance-based payment system used under the Medicare program that meets the requirements of this chapter, modified as necessary to account for programmatic differences, if implementing the system would:
    
    (A)  reduce unnecessary administrative burdens; and
    
    (B)  align quality-based payment incentives for physicians and other health care providers with the Medicare program; and
    
    (3)  alternative payment methodologies within a system that are used in the Medicare program, modified as necessary to account for programmatic differences, and that will achieve cost savings and improve quality of care in the child health plan program and Medicaid.
    
    (d)  In developing the quality-based payment systems, the commission shall ensure that a system will not reward a physician, other health care provider, or managed care organization for withholding or delaying medically necessary care.
    
    (e)  The commission may modify a quality-based payment system to account for:
    
    (1)  programmatic differences between the child health plan program and Medicaid; and
    
    (2)  delivery systems under those programs.
