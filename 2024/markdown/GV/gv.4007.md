    SUBCHAPTER A.  AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE TITLE
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 4007.001.  ENFORCEMENT BY COMMISSIONER, ATTORNEY GENERAL, AND DISTRICT OR COUNTY ATTORNEY.  (a)  The administration of the provisions of this title is vested in the commissioner.
    
    (b)  The commissioner and the attorney general shall:
    
    (1)  ensure that the provisions of this title are obeyed; and
    
    (2)  conduct investigations and take measures to prevent or detect a violation of this title.
    
    (c)  The commissioner shall at once submit any evidence of a criminal violation of this title to the district or county attorney of the appropriate county after the evidence comes to the commissioner's knowledge.
    
    (d)  If the district or county attorney neglects or refuses to prosecute the alleged criminal violation, the commissioner shall submit the evidence of the alleged violation to the attorney general.  The attorney general may proceed with the criminal prosecution of the alleged violation and has all the rights, privileges, and powers conferred by law on a district or county attorney, including the authority to appear before a grand jury and to interrogate witnesses before a grand jury.
    
    (e)  Subject to Subsection (h), the board may provide assistance to a county or district attorney who requests assistance in a criminal prosecution involving an alleged violation of this title that is referred by the board to the attorney under Subsection (c).
    
    (f)  Before referring a case to a county or district attorney for prosecution as required by Subsection (c), the commissioner shall make a determination of:
    
    (1)  the potential resources of the board, including the number and types of board employees, that would be needed to assist in the prosecution of the case; and
    
    (2)  the availability of board employees and other resources necessary to carry out any request for assistance.
    
    (g)  The board by rule shall establish a process to enable the commissioner to determine whether to provide any requested assistance to the appropriate prosecuting attorney following referral of a case under Subsection (c) and, if so, the appropriate amount of such assistance. The rules must require the commissioner to consider:
    
    (1)  whether resources are available after taking into account any ongoing board investigations, investigations under Section [4007.053](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=4007.053), and criminal prosecutions for which assistance is being provided;
    
    (2)  the seriousness of the alleged violation or violations in the case, including the severity of the harm and number of victims involved; and
    
    (3)  the state's interest in the prosecution of a particular case and the availability of other methods of redress for the alleged violations, including the pursuit of a civil action.
    
    (h)  In response to a request for assistance under Subsection (e), the board may provide only those board employees or resources, if any, determined to be available for that case in accordance with Subsection (f). If a change in circumstances occurs after the time of the determination under Subsection (f), the commissioner may reconsider the commissioner's determination under that subsection and may increase or reduce the number of board employees or other resources to be made available for a case using the process established under Subsection (g).
    
    (i)  The attorney general, at least biennially, shall review a sample of criminal cases for which the board provided requested assistance to county or district attorneys under this section. The review must include an evaluation of the pre-referral determination of available resources to support each case being reviewed as required by Subsection (f) and any subsequent determination of those resources made by the commissioner as authorized under Subsection (h).  The attorney general may report any concerns the attorney general has in connection with the board's provision of assistance to the standing committee of each house of the legislature with primary jurisdiction over board matters.

    (b)  The commissioner may request the attorney general to bring an action as provided by this section for the appointment of a receiver for a person or company to which this section applies or the assets of the person or company if it appears to the commissioner, on complaint or otherwise, that:
    
    (1)  the person or company has:
    
    (A)  engaged in an act, transaction, practice, or course of business declared as a fraudulent practice under Section [4007.152](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=4007.152) or [4007.153](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=4007.153); and

    (2)  the appointment of a receiver for the person or company or the assets of the person or company is necessary to conserve and protect the assets for the benefit of customers, security holders, and other claimants and potential claimants of the person or company.
    
    (c)  On the commissioner's request under Subsection (b), the attorney general may bring an action against a person or company in the name and on behalf of the state if it appears to the attorney general that the facts described by that subsection exist with respect to the person or company.  The facts contained in the petition for the appointment of a receiver must be verified by the commissioner on information and belief.
    
    (d)  An action under this section may be brought in a district court of any county in which the fraudulent practice that is the subject of the petition was wholly or partly committed or in a county in which any defendant for whom the appointment of a receiver is sought has the defendant's principal place of business.  A district court described by this subsection has jurisdiction and venue of the action.  This subsection is superior to any other provision of law establishing jurisdiction or venue with regard to an action for receivership.
    
    (e)  The attorney general may apply for and, on proper showing, is entitled to have a subpoena issued by the court that requires:
    
    (1)  the appearance, without delay, of a defendant or any employee, investment adviser representative, or agent of the defendant to testify and give evidence concerning a matter relevant to the appointment of a receiver; and
    
    (2)  the production of documents, books, and records that may be necessary for a hearing on the action.

If the application is filed not later than the 30th day after the date the person or company is served with the order appointing the receiver, the person or company is entitled to a hearing on the application not later than the 10th day after the date written notice is provided to the attorney general.

    (B)  the commissioner; and
    
    (C)  the defendant against whom the appointment of a receiver is sought, if the court considers it practicable; and

    (2)  conditioned on the faithful discharge of the receiver's duties.
    
    (j)  The remedy provided by this section is in addition to any other remedy made available to the commissioner or the attorney general by statutory laws or case law of this state, including any provision authorizing receiverships.
