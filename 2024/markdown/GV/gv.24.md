    (f)  A retired judge appointed to sit for the regular judge under this section shall receive for the services actually performed the same salary that the regular judge is entitled to receive for those services.  The amount to be paid for the services shall be paid in the same manner as the regular judge is paid on certification by the presiding judge of the administrative judicial region that the retired judge has rendered the services and is entitled to receive the salary.  The payment shall be made from the item in the judiciary section, comptroller's department, of the appropriations act providing for payment of salaries of district judges and criminal district judges.

    Sec. 24.946.  PROCEDURE.  (a)  The board shall meet in accordance with its own rules.  The board shall meet at least once in each interim between regular sessions of the legislature and shall exercise its reapportionment powers only in the interims between regular legislative sessions.  Meetings of the board shall be subject to the provisions of Chapter [551](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=551), except as otherwise provided by this subchapter.  A reapportionment may not be ordered in the interim immediately following a regular session of the legislature in which a valid and subsisting statewide reapportionment of judicial districts is enacted by the legislature.  Unless the legislature enacts a statewide reapportionment of the judicial districts following each federal decennial census, the board shall convene not later than the first Monday of June of the third year following the year in which the federal decennial census is taken to make a statewide reapportionment of the districts.  The board shall complete its work on the reapportionment and file its order with the secretary of state not later than August 31 of the same year.  If the Judicial Districts Board fails to make a statewide apportionment by that date, the Legislative Redistricting Board established by Article III, Section [28](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=3.28), of the Texas Constitution shall make a statewide reapportionment of the judicial districts not later than the 150th day after the final day for the Judicial Districts Board to make the reapportionment, and that apportionment takes effect as provided by Sections [24.948](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=24.948) and [24.949](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=24.949).
    
    (b)  The board shall adopt its own rules of procedure and has the power to make investigations, hold hearings, compel by subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of records, administer oaths, and do all things necessary in its judgment to carry out its duties.
    
    (c)  On the request of the chairman, a peace officer shall serve a subpoena issued by the board.  The officer shall serve the subpoena in the same manner as a subpoena issued by a district court is served.  If the person to whom a subpoena is directed fails to comply, the board may bring suit in the district court to enforce the subpoena.  If the court determines that good cause exists for the issuance of the subpoena, the court shall order compliance.  The court may modify the requirements of a subpoena that the court determines are unreasonable.  Failure to comply with the order of the district court is punishable as contempt.
    
    (d)  The board may provide for the compensation of subpoenaed witnesses.  The amount of compensation may not exceed the amount paid to a witness subpoenaed by a district court in a civil proceeding.

    (b)  If a county in which any part of the jurisdiction vested by general law in the county court has been transferred or made concurrent in a district court is removed by reapportionment under this subchapter from the judicial districts of all district courts having the county court jurisdiction, the board shall specify whether, after the effective date of the reapportionment order, the transferred county court jurisdiction is vested in the district court of the judicial districts in which the county is included under the reapportionment order or whether the transferred county court jurisdiction is revested in the county court.
    
    (c)  If the office of district attorney is authorized by law in or for a judicial district, a reapportionment under this subchapter does not change the county or counties included in the district for purposes of election, functions, duties, and authority of the district attorney, his assistants, and their successors in office.

If a county is removed from a judicial district and placed or left in more than one judicial district, the clerk shall transfer the cases and proceedings to the district court of the judicial district for that county having the lowest numerical designation.
    
    (b)  If cases or other proceedings are transferred from a district court to another district court in accordance with this subchapter, all writs, processes, bonds, bail bonds, recognizances, complaints, informations and indictments, and any other matters returnable to the court from which the cases or proceedings were transferred are returnable to the court to which the cases or proceedings are transferred and are as valid as if they had been made returnable originally to that court.
