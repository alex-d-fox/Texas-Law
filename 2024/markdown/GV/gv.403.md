    Sec. 403.019.  CONTRACTS TO COLLECT OUT-OF-STATE DEBTS.  (a)  The comptroller may contract with a person who is qualified in the business of debt collection to collect on behalf of this state a tax or other amount finally determined to be owed to this state by a person residing outside this state and not known by the agency referring the debt to have sufficient assets in this state to satisfy the debt if the comptroller determines that the collection service to be provided by the collector would be economical and in the best interest of the state.  Subject to Subsection (c), a contract may permit or require the person to pursue a judicial action in a court outside this state to collect a tax or other amount owed.  A contract may also apply to a tax or other amount owed by a person residing outside this state and not known by the agency referring the debt to have sufficient assets in this state to satisfy the debt to a political subdivision of this state, if the comptroller or another state official is required by law to collect the tax or other amount owed for the political subdivision.  No contract authorized under this section may exceed four years in length, except that such contract may provide for an extension for the sole purpose of concluding actions pending at the time of the termination of the contract.  This restriction shall not be construed so as to prohibit a contractor from bidding on a subsequent contract.
    
    (b)  The comptroller must obtain services authorized by this section in the manner provided for the purchase of services by contract under Chapters 2155-2158.  In addition to any other notice required by that Act for inviting bids, the comptroller shall solicit bids for a contract by publishing notice in the Texas Register.
    
    (c)  A contract under this section is not valid unless approved by the attorney general.  The attorney general shall approve a contract if the attorney general determines that the contract complies with the requirements of this section and is in the best interest of the state.  No judicial action by any person on behalf of the state under a contract authorized and approved by this section may be brought unless approved by the attorney general.
    
    (d)  A contract authorized by this section may provide for reasonable compensation for services provided under the contract, including compensation determined by the application of a specified percentage of the total amount collected, including penalties, interest, court costs, or attorney's fees.  If the debt to be collected consists of unpaid taxes, including any penalties, interest, or costs incurred in connection with the taxes, for which tax enforcement funds are available, the comptroller shall pay the compensation for services provided under the contract from those funds.
    
    (e)  An amount collected under a contract authorized by this section shall be deposited in a suspense account established for that purpose in the state treasury.  The comptroller shall pay any compensation provided by the contract that is not paid from other funds under Subsection (d) from the suspense account.  After those amounts have been paid, the remainder shall be transferred to the fund or account to which the amount collected is required to be deposited.  If the amount collected is not required to be deposited to a specific fund or account, the amount shall be transferred to the general revenue fund.
    
    (f)  The comptroller may provide for the imposition of a collection fee not to exceed 15 percent of the amount owed in addition to the other amounts owed to this state to be collected under a contract authorized by this section.  The person who owes the other amounts to be collected under the contract is liable for the collection fee.  The collection fee may be collected under the contract in addition to the other amounts due.  The amount of the collection fee is the amount provided by the contract, whether a specified amount or an amount contingent on the amount collected or other factor, for compensation of the person with whom the contract is made and any court costs or attorney's fees incurred in collecting the amount owed to this state.
    
    (g)  The comptroller shall require a person acting on behalf of the state under a contract authorized by this section to post a bond or other security in an amount the comptroller determines is sufficient to cover all revenue or other property of the state that is expected to come into the possession or control of the person in the course of providing the service.
    
    (h)  A person acting on behalf of the state under a contract authorized by this section does not exercise any of the sovereign power of this state, except that the person is an agent of this state for purposes of determining the priority of a claim that the person is attempting to collect under the contract with respect to the claims of other creditors.
    
    (i)  The comptroller may provide a person acting on behalf of the state under a contract authorized by this section with any confidential information in the custody of the comptroller relating to the debtor that is necessary to the collection of the claim and that the comptroller is not prohibited from sharing under an agreement with another state or the federal government.  A person acting on behalf of the state under a contract authorized by this section, and each employee or agent of the person, is subject to all prohibitions against the disclosure of confidential information obtained from the state in connection with the contract that apply to the comptroller or an employee of the comptroller.  A person acting on behalf of the state under a contract authorized by this section or an employee or agent of the person who discloses confidential information in violation of a prohibition made applicable to the person under this subsection is subject to the same sanctions and penalties that would apply to the comptroller or an employee of the comptroller for that disclosure.
    
    (j)  The comptroller shall require a person acting on behalf of the state under a contract authorized by this section to obtain and maintain insurance coverage adequate to provide reasonable coverage for damages negligently, recklessly, or intentionally caused by the person or the person's agent in the course of collecting a debt under the contract and to protect the state from any liability for those damages.  This state is not liable for and may not indemnify a person acting on behalf of the state under a contract authorized by this section for damages negligently, recklessly, or intentionally caused by the person or the person's agent in the course of collecting a tax or other amount under the contract.
    
    (k)  In addition to any other reasons that may be provided in the contract, a contract authorized under this section may be terminated if a person acting on behalf of the state under such contract, or an employee or agent of the person, is found to be in violation of the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, discloses confidential information to a person not authorized to receive it as provided in Subsection (i) of this section, or performs any act resulting in a final judgment for damages against this state.
    
    (l)  The execution of a contract under this section does not accelerate the imposition of any penalty imposed or to be imposed on the tax or other amount to be collected under the contract.

    (b)  In a contract under Subsection (a), the total consideration to be paid by the state:
    
    (1)  must be contingent on a recovery by the state;
    
    (2)  may not exceed five percent of the amount of the revenue or the value of the other property that the state recovers as a result of the pursuit of the claim about which the contracting person provided information;  and
    
    (3)  may be limited by agreement not to exceed a specified, absolute dollar amount.
    
    (c)  Consideration may not be paid by the state under a contract executed under Subsection (a) if, at the time the contract is executed or within three months after the date of execution and by means other than disclosure under the contract, a state employee has knowledge of the claim disclosed under the contract or has knowledge of a cause of action different from that disclosed under the contract but entitling the state to recover the same revenue or other property.  An affidavit by a state employee claiming that knowledge under those circumstances is prima facie evidence of the knowledge and circumstances.
    
    (d)  This section does not apply to or affect property that is recoverable by the state under Chapters [71](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=71) through [75](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=75), Property Code.
    
    (e)  If the state recovers property in connection with a contract executed under this section and payment of the contractual consideration is not prohibited by Subsection (c), an amount not to exceed five percent of the amount of revenue or proceeds from the sale of property recovered shall be deposited to the credit of the comptroller's operating fund for payment of the consideration.  The balance of the revenue or proceeds from the sale of property recovered shall be deposited to the credit of the general revenue fund or to any special fund as required by law.

The agency responsible for making the refund may not make a refund without receiving that evidence.
    
    (g)  Before paying a refund under this section, the comptroller shall credit the amount due to the person claiming the refund against any other amount finally determined to be due to the state from the person according to information in the custody of the comptroller and shall refund the remainder.

    (i)  This section is not a waiver of sovereign immunity for a refund suit.

If the amount was not required to be paid on or before a particular date, a refund claim may not be made after four years from the date the amount was collected or received.

    Sec. 403.079.  USING SAMPLING TECHNIQUES TO AUDIT CLAIMS.  (a)  The comptroller may use generally recognized sampling techniques to audit claims against the state.  Those techniques may be used only when the comptroller determines that they would be cost-effective and would promote greater efficiency in paying claims.  The comptroller's proper use of sampling techniques satisfies the auditing requirements of Section [403.071](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=403.071).

The comptroller may use that projection to estimate the amount of unaudited claims that were improperly paid.  The comptroller may submit that estimate to the governor, state auditor, and the Legislative Budget Board.

Section 191 or 355 (1984) shall be deposited to the credit of the fund.  The comptroller shall distribute money in the fund to each eligible county in the amount and manner and for the purposes provided by federal law and this section.
    
    (b)  A county is eligible to receive funds under this section if federal land for which the state receives a portion of the money from sales, bonuses, royalties, or rentals under 30 U.S.C. Section 191 or 355 (1984) is located in the county.  An eligible county is entitled to receive from the fund all of the money paid to the state and deposited in the fund from all sales, bonuses, royalties, and rentals received from federal public land located in the county.
    
    (c)  Not later than the 10th day after the date that a county receives a payment from the comptroller under this section the county shall distribute the payment as follows:
    
    (1)  50 percent of the payment is available for distribution to the independent school districts located in whole or part in the county, with each school district receiving a proportionate share according to Subsection (d);
    
    (2)  15 percent of the payment is available for distribution to the incorporated municipalities located in whole or part in the county, with each municipality receiving a proportionate share according to Subsection (e);  and
    
    (3)  35 percent of the payment is available for the county to retain.
    
    (d)  The proportionate share of an independent school district is determined by multiplying the total amount of the payment available for distribution to school districts by the ratio that the average daily attendance for students who reside in the county and who attend that school district bears to the average daily attendance for all students who reside in the county and who attend any independent school district.  However, if there are fewer than 10 independent school districts located in whole or part in the county and if an independent school district would receive under this formula less than 10 percent of the total payment available for distribution to independent school districts, the school district's share shall be increased to 10 percent of the total payment and the shares of the school districts that would receive more than 10 percent under the formula shall be reduced proportionately, but not to an amount less than 10 percent of the total payment.  Each independent school district shall develop a reasonable method for determining the average daily attendance for students who reside in the county and who attend the school district.
    
    (e)  The proportionate share of a municipality is determined by multiplying the total payment available for distribution to municipalities by the ratio that the number of residents of that municipality who live in the county bears to the total number of residents of all municipalities who live in the county.  The number of residents shall be determined according to the most recent federal census.
    
    (f)  Money from the fund may be used only for planning, for constructing and maintaining public facilities, and for providing public service.
    
    (g)  The comptroller shall administer this section and distribute money from the fund to eligible counties as provided by this section and rules adopted under this section.  The comptroller shall adopt rules establishing:

    (2)  methods for monitoring the uses and expenditures of the money;  and
    
    (3)  other methods and procedures necessary to carry out this section and federal laws and rules governing the money distributed.

    (d)  The amount of any distributions to each fund under Subsection (c) shall be determined by the comptroller in a manner intended to provide a stable and predictable stream of annual distributions and to maintain over time the purchasing power of fund investments and annual distributions to the fund.  If the purchasing power of fund investments for any 10-year period is not preserved, the comptroller may not increase annual distributions to the available earnings of the fund until the purchasing power of the fund investments is restored.
    
    (e)  An annual distribution made by the comptroller to the available earnings of a fund during any fiscal year may not exceed an amount equal to seven percent of the average net fair market value of the investment assets of each fund as determined by the comptroller.

    (c)  Subject to Subsection (d), the comptroller shall transmit to each eligible taxing unit's treasurer, or to the officer performing the functions of that office, on a monthly basis, the taxing unit's share of money held in trust under Subsection (a), together with the pro rata share of any penalty or interest on delinquent taxes computed using the single local use tax rate that may be collected. Before transmitting the funds, the comptroller shall deduct two percent of each taxing unit's share as a charge by the state for its services under this section and deposit that amount into the state treasury to the credit of the comptroller's operating fund. Interest earned on all deposits made in the state treasury under this section shall be credited to the general revenue fund.
    
    (d)  The comptroller shall retain a portion of each eligible taxing unit's share of money held in trust under Subsection (a), not to exceed five percent of the amount eligible to be transmitted to the taxing unit under Subsection (c).

    (e)  The comptroller shall compute for each calendar month the percentage of the total sales and use tax allocations made pursuant to Title 3, Tax Code, including any local sales and use taxes governed by any provision of Title 3, Tax Code, to each eligible taxing unit.  The comptroller shall determine each eligible taxing unit's share of the money held in trust from deposits under Subsection (a) for that month by applying the percentage computed under this subsection for the eligible taxing unit to the total amount held in trust from deposits for that month.
    
    (f)  The comptroller may combine an eligible taxing unit's share of the money held in trust under Subsection (a) with other money held for that taxing unit.
    
    (g)  The comptroller may adopt rules to administer this section.

    (b)  Until the state fiscal year beginning after the first tax year in which the average school district maintenance and operations tax rate is not more than $1.00 per $100 of taxable value, money in the fund may be appropriated only for a purpose that will result in a reduction of school district maintenance and operations tax rates to rates that are less than the rates in effect for the 2005 tax year.
    
    (c)  Beginning in the state fiscal year that begins after the first tax year in which the average school district maintenance and operations tax rate is not more than $1.00 per $100 of taxable value, any money remaining in the fund after a sufficient amount of money is appropriated in that state fiscal year to maintain an average school district maintenance and operations tax rate of $1.00 per $100 of taxable value may be appropriated only as follows:
    
    (1)  two-thirds of the money appropriated from the fund may be appropriated only for a purpose that will result in a further reduction of the average school district maintenance and operations tax rate; and
    
    (2)  one-third of the money appropriated from the fund may be appropriated only for the purpose of increasing the level of equalization of school district enrichment tax effort to the extent that limits reliance by school districts on local property tax effort and decreases the enrichment tax rates of districts.

To the extent that any money credited to the trust fund for a particular success contract remains unpaid at the time the particular contract expires or is terminated, as soon after the contract expiration as is practicable, the comptroller shall return the unpaid amount to the grantor, donor, or state treasury fund or account from which the money was gifted, granted, donated, or appropriated.

    (B)  in the two studies preceding the most recent study, the school district's local value was valid under Section [403.302](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=403.302)(c);
    
    (C)  in the most recent study, the aggregate local value of all of the categories of property sampled by the comptroller is not less than 90 percent of the lower limit of the margin of error as determined by the comptroller of the aggregate value as determined by the comptroller of all of the categories of property sampled by the comptroller; and
    
    (D)  the appraisal district that appraises property for the school district was in compliance with the scoring requirement of the comptroller's most recent review of the appraisal district conducted under Section [5.102](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=5.102), Tax Code.

    Acts 2009, 81st Leg., R.S., Ch. 288 (H.B. [8](http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/81R/billtext/html/HB00008F.HTM)), Sec. 1, eff. January 1, 2010.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 403.302.  DETERMINATION OF SCHOOL DISTRICT PROPERTY VALUES.  (a)  The comptroller shall conduct a study using comparable sales and generally accepted auditing and sampling techniques to determine the total taxable value of all property in each school district. The study shall determine the taxable value of all property and of each category of property in the district and the productivity value of all land that qualifies for appraisal on the basis of its productive capacity and for which the owner has applied for and received a productivity appraisal.  The comptroller shall make appropriate adjustments in the study to account for actions taken under Chapter [49](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=49), Education Code.
    
    (a-1)  The comptroller shall conduct a study:
    
    (1)  at least every two years in each school district for which the most recent study resulted in a determination by the comptroller that the school district's local value was valid; and
    
    (2)  each year in a school district for which the most recent study resulted in a determination by the comptroller that the school district's local value was not valid.
    
    (a-2)  If in any year the comptroller does not conduct a study, the school district's local value for that year is considered to be valid.
    
    (b)  In conducting the study, the comptroller shall determine the taxable value of property in each school district:
    
    (1)  using, if appropriate, samples selected through generally accepted sampling techniques;
    
    (2)  according to generally accepted standard valuation, statistical compilation, and analysis techniques;
    
    (3)  ensuring that different levels of appraisal on sold and unsold property do not adversely affect the accuracy of the study; and
    
    (4)  ensuring that different levels of appraisal resulting from protests determined under Section [41.43](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41.43), Tax Code, are appropriately adjusted in the study.
    
    (c)  If after conducting the study the comptroller determines that the local value for a school district is valid, the local value is presumed to represent taxable value for the school district.  In the absence of that presumption, taxable value for a school district is the state value for the school district determined by the comptroller under Subsections (a) and (b) unless the local value exceeds the state value, in which case the taxable value for the school district is the district's local value.  In determining whether the local value for a school district is valid, the comptroller shall use a margin of error that does not exceed five percent unless the comptroller determines that the size of the sample of properties necessary to make the determination makes the use of such a margin of error not feasible, in which case the comptroller may use a larger margin of error.
    
    (c-1)  This subsection applies only to a school district whose central administrative office is located in a county with a population of 10,000 or less and a total area of more than 6,000 square miles.  If after conducting the study for a tax year the comptroller determines that the local value for a school district is not valid, the comptroller shall adjust the taxable value determined under Subsections (a) and (b) as follows:
    
    (1)  for each category of property sampled and tested by the comptroller in the school district, the comptroller shall use the weighted mean appraisal ratio determined by the study, unless the ratio is more than four percentage points lower than the weighted mean appraisal ratio determined by the comptroller for that category of property in the immediately preceding study, in which case the comptroller shall use the weighted mean appraisal ratio determined in the immediately preceding study minus four percentage points;
    
    (2)  the comptroller shall use the category weighted mean appraisal ratios as adjusted under Subdivision (1) to establish a value estimate for each category of property sampled and tested by the comptroller in the school district; and
    
    (3)  the value estimates established under Subdivision (2), together with the local tax roll value for any categories not sampled and tested by the comptroller, less total deductions determined by the comptroller, determine the taxable value for the school district.

    (g)  The comptroller shall publish preliminary findings, listing values by district, before February 1 of the year following the year of the study.  Preliminary findings shall be delivered to each school district and shall be certified to the commissioner of education.
    
    (h)  On request of the commissioner of education or a school district, the comptroller may audit the total taxable value of property in a school district and may revise the study findings.  The request for audit is limited to corrections and changes in a school district's appraisal roll that occurred after preliminary certification of the study findings by the comptroller.  Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, the request for audit must be filed with the comptroller not later than the third anniversary of the date of the final certification of the study findings.  The request for audit may be filed not later than the first anniversary of the date the chief appraiser certifies a change to the appraisal roll if the chief appraiser corrects the appraisal roll under Section [25.25](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=25.25) or [42.41](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=42.41), Tax Code, and the change results in a material reduction in the total taxable value of property in the school district. The comptroller shall certify the findings of the audit to the commissioner of education.

    (i)  If the comptroller determines in the study that the market value of property in a school district as determined by the appraisal district that appraises property for the school district, less the total of the amounts and values listed in Subsection (d) as determined by that appraisal district, is valid, the comptroller, in determining the taxable value of property in the school district under Subsection (d), shall for purposes of Subsection (d)(13) subtract from the market value as determined by the appraisal district of residence homesteads to which Section [23.23](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=23.23), Tax Code, applies the amount by which that amount exceeds the appraised value of those properties as calculated by the appraisal district under Section [23.23](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=23.23), Tax Code.  If the comptroller determines in the study that the market value of property in a school district as determined by the appraisal district that appraises property for the school district, less the total of the amounts and values listed in Subsection (d) as determined by that appraisal district, is not valid, the comptroller, in determining the taxable value of property in the school district under Subsection (d), shall for purposes of Subsection (d)(13) subtract from the market value as estimated by the comptroller of residence homesteads to which Section [23.23](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=23.23), Tax Code, applies the amount by which that amount exceeds the appraised value of those properties as calculated by the appraisal district under Section [23.23](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=23.23), Tax Code.
    
    (j)  The comptroller shall certify the final taxable value for each school district, appropriately adjusted to give effect to certain provisions of the Education Code related to school funding, to the commissioner of education as provided by the terms of a memorandum of understanding entered into between the comptroller, the Legislative Budget Board, and the commissioner of education.
    
    (j-1)  In the final certification of the study under Subsection (j), the comptroller shall separately identify the final taxable value for each school district as adjusted to account for the reduction of the amount of the limitation on tax increases provided by Section [11.26](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.26)(a-10), Tax Code.
    
    (j-2)  In the final certification of the study under Subsection (j), the comptroller shall separately identify the final taxable value for each school district as adjusted to account for the reduction of the amount of the limitation on tax increases provided by Sections [11.26](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.26)(a-5), (a-6), (a-7), (a-8), (a-9), (a-10), (a-11), and (a-12), Tax Code.  This subsection expires January 1, 2025.
    
    (k)  If the comptroller determines in the final certification of the study that the school district's local value as determined by the appraisal district that appraises property for the school district is not valid, the comptroller shall provide notice of the comptroller's determination to the board of directors of the appraisal district.  The board of directors of the appraisal district shall hold a public meeting to discuss the receipt of notice under this subsection.
    
    (k-1)  If the comptroller determines in the final certification of the study that the school district's local value as determined by the appraisal district that appraises property for the school district is not valid for three consecutive years, the comptroller shall conduct an additional review of the appraisal district under Section [5.102](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=5.102), Tax Code, and provide recommendations to the appraisal district regarding appraisal standards, procedures, and methodologies.  The comptroller may contract with a third party to assist the comptroller in conducting the additional review and providing the recommendations required under this subsection.  If the appraisal district fails to comply with the recommendations provided under this subsection and the comptroller finds that the board of directors of the appraisal district failed to take remedial action reasonably designed to ensure substantial compliance with each recommendation before the first anniversary of the date the recommendations were made, the comptroller shall notify the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, or a successor to the department, which shall take action necessary to ensure that the recommendations are implemented as soon as practicable.  Before February 1 of the year following the year in which the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, or a successor to the department, takes action under this subsection, the department, with the assistance of the comptroller, shall determine whether the recommendations have been substantially implemented and notify the chief appraiser and the board of directors of the appraisal district of the determination.  If the department determines that the recommendations have not been substantially implemented, the board of directors of the appraisal district must, within three months of the determination, consider whether the failure to implement the recommendations was under the current chief appraiser's control and whether the chief appraiser is able to adequately perform the chief appraiser's duties.
    
    (l)  If after conducting the study for a year the comptroller determines that a school district is an eligible school district, for that year and the following year the taxable value for the school district is the district's local value.

    (2)  instructions and examples regarding how to answer the questions in the survey;
    
    (3)  answers to frequently asked questions; and 
    
    (4)  any other information the comptroller determines is necessary to assist individuals in completing the survey.
    
    (c)  At least once each year, the comptroller shall conduct an online or in-person informational session that is open to the public regarding how to complete the farm and ranch survey.  The comptroller shall post a recording of the informational session on the comptroller's Internet website.
    
    (d)  At least once each year, the comptroller shall solicit comments from the public and the property tax administration advisory board for the purposes of:
    
    (1)  determining the ease and understandability of the farm and ranch survey; and
    
    (2)  ensuring that the questions in the survey are designed to generate reliable answers.
    
    (e)  The chief appraiser of each appraisal district shall distribute the farm and ranch survey instructional guide to the members of the agricultural advisory board for the appraisal district appointed under Section [6.12](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=6.12), Tax Code, and shall provide information to the board regarding how to access the informational session provided under Subsection (c) of this section.

    Added by Acts 2021, 87th Leg., R.S., Ch. 390 (S.B. [1245](http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/87R/billtext/html/SB01245F.HTM)), Sec. 1, eff. September 1, 2021.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 403.303.  PROTEST.  (a)  A school district or a property owner whose property is included in the study under Section [403.302](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=403.302) and whose tax liability on the property is $100,000 or more may protest the comptroller's findings under Section [403.302](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=403.302)(g) or (h) by filing a petition with the comptroller.  The petition must be filed not later than the 40th day after the date on which the comptroller's findings are certified to the commissioner of education and must specify the grounds for objection and the value claimed to be correct by the school district or property owner.
    
    (b)  After receipt of a petition, the comptroller shall hold a hearing.  The comptroller has the burden to prove the accuracy of the findings.  Until a final decision is made by the comptroller, the taxable value of property in the district is determined, with respect to property subject to the protest, according to the value claimed by the school district or property owner, except that the value to be used while a final decision is pending may not be less than the appraisal roll value for the year of the study.  If after a hearing the comptroller concludes that the findings should be changed, the comptroller shall order the appropriate changes and shall certify to the commissioner of education the changes in the values of the school district that brought the protest, the values of the school district named by the property owner who brought the protest, or, if the comptroller by rule allows an appraisal district to bring a protest, the values of the school district named by the appraisal district that brought the protest.  The comptroller may not order a change in the values of a school district as a result of a protest brought by another school district, a property owner in the other school district, or an appraisal district that appraises property for the other school district.  The comptroller shall complete all protest hearings and certify all changes as necessary to comply with Chapter [48](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48), Education Code.  A hearing conducted under this subsection is not a contested case for purposes of Section [2001.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001.003).
    
    (c)  The comptroller shall adopt procedural rules governing the conduct of protest hearings.  The rules shall provide each protesting school district and property owner with the requirements for submitting a petition initiating a protest and shall provide each protesting school district and property owner with adequate notice of a hearing, an opportunity to present evidence and oral argument, and notice of the comptroller's decision on the hearing.
    
    (d)  A protesting school district may appeal a determination of a protest by the comptroller to a district court of Travis County by filing a petition with the court.  An appeal must be filed not later than the 30th day after the date the school district receives notification of a final decision on a protest.  Review is conducted by the court sitting without a jury.  The court shall remand the determination to the comptroller if on the review the court discovers that substantial rights of the school district have been prejudiced, and that:
    
    (1)  the comptroller has acted arbitrarily and without regard to the facts;  or
    
    (2)  the finding of the comptroller is not reasonably supported by substantial evidence introduced before the court.
    
    (e)  If, in a hearing under Subsection (b), the comptroller has not heard the case or read the record, the decision may not be made until a proposal for decision is served on each party and an opportunity to file exceptions is afforded to each party adversely affected.  If exceptions are filed, an opportunity must be afforded to all other parties to file replies to the exceptions.  The proposal for decision must contain a statement of the reasons for the proposed decision, prepared by the person who conducted the hearing or by a person who has read the record.
