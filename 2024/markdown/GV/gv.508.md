    (3)  the Texas Correctional Office on Offenders with Medical or Mental Impairments, in cooperation with the pardons and paroles division, has prepared for the inmate a medically recommended intensive supervision plan that requires the inmate to submit to electronic monitoring, places the inmate on super-intensive supervision, or otherwise ensures appropriate supervision of the inmate.

    (c)  The parole panel shall require as a condition of release under Subsection (a) that the releasee remain under the care of a physician and in a medically suitable placement.  At least once each calendar quarter, the Texas Correctional Office on Offenders with Medical or Mental Impairments shall report to the parole panel on the releasee's medical and placement status.  On the basis of the report, the parole panel may modify conditions of release and impose any condition on the releasee that a panel could impose on a releasee released under Section [508.145](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=508.145), including a condition that the releasee reside in a halfway house or community residential facility.
    
    (d)  The Texas Correctional Office on Offenders with Medical or Mental Impairments and the Texas Department of Human Services shall jointly request proposals from public or private vendors to provide under contract services for inmates released on medically recommended intensive supervision.  A request for proposals under this subsection may require that the services be provided in a medical care facility located in an urban area.  For the purposes of this subsection, "urban area" means the area in this state within a metropolitan statistical area, according to the standards of the United States Bureau of the Census.
    
    (e)  Only parole panels composed of the presiding officer of the board and two members appointed to the panel by the presiding officer may make determinations regarding the release of inmates on medically recommended intensive supervision under Subsection (a) or of inmates released pending deportation.  If the Texas Council on Offenders with Mental Impairments identifies an inmate as a candidate for release under the guidelines established by Subsection (a)(1), the council shall present to a parole panel described by this subsection relevant information concerning the inmate and the inmate's potential for release under this section.
    
    (f)  An inmate who is not a citizen of the United States, as defined by federal law, who is not under a sentence of death or life without parole, and who does not have a reportable conviction or adjudication under Chapter [62](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=62), Code of Criminal Procedure, or an instant offense described in Article [42A.054](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=42A.054), Code of Criminal Procedure, may be released to immigration authorities pending deportation on a date designated by a parole panel described by Subsection (e) if the parole panel determines that on release the inmate would be deported to another country and that the inmate does not constitute a threat to public safety in the other country or this country and is unlikely to reenter this country illegally.

    Sec. 508.1555.  PROCEDURE FOR THE EARLY RELEASE FROM SUPERVISION OF CERTAIN RELEASEES.  (a)  A parole officer annually shall identify the releasees under the parole officer's supervision who are eligible for early release from supervision under Section [508.155](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=508.155)(c).  A releasee is eligible for early release if:
    
    (1)  the releasee has been under supervision for at least one-half of the time that remained on the releasee's sentence when the releasee was released from imprisonment;
    
    (2)  during the preceding two-year period, the releasee has not committed any violation of the rules or conditions of release;
    
    (3)  during the period of supervision the releasee's parole or release to mandatory supervision has not been revoked; and
    
    (4)  the division determines:
    
    (A)  that the releasee has made a good faith effort to comply with any restitution order imposed on the releasee by a court; and
    
    (B)  that allowing the releasee to serve the remainder of the releasee's sentence without supervision and reporting is in the best interest of society.
    
    (b)  After identifying any releasees who are eligible for early release under Subsection (a), the parole officer shall review the eligible releasees, including any releasees the parole officer has previously declined to recommend for early release, to determine if a recommendation for early release from supervision is appropriate.  In conducting the review and determining recommendations, the parole officer shall consider whether the releasee:
    
    (1)  has a low risk of recidivism as determined by an assessment developed by the department; and
    
    (2)  has made a good faith effort to comply with the conditions of release.
    
    (c)  A parole officer shall forward to the parole supervisor at the regional level any recommendations for early release the parole officer makes under Subsection (b).  If the parole supervisor approves the recommendation, the division shall allow a releasee to serve the remainder of the releasee's sentence without supervision and without being required to report as authorized by Section [508.155](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=508.155).

The panel may impose any reasonable condition of parole on the person that the panel may impose on an adult inmate under this chapter.
    
    (b)  The panel shall furnish the person with a written statement clearly describing the conditions and rules of parole.  The person must accept and sign the statement as a precondition to release on parole.
    
    (c)  While on parole, the person remains in the legal custody of the state and shall comply with the conditions of parole ordered by a panel under this section.

    (e)  If a parole panel revokes the person's parole, the panel may require the person to serve the remaining portion of the person's sentence in the institutional division.  The remaining portion of the person's sentence is computed without credit for the time from the date of the person's release to the date of revocation. The panel may not recommit the person to the Texas Juvenile Justice Department or to the custody of a juvenile board or local juvenile probation department.
    
    (f)  For purposes of this chapter, a person released from the Texas Juvenile Justice Department or the custody of a juvenile board or local juvenile probation department on parole under this section is considered to have been convicted of the offense for which the person has been adjudicated.

    Sec. 508.181.  RESIDENCE DURING RELEASE.  (a)  Except as provided by Subsections (b) and (c), a parole panel shall require as a condition of parole or mandatory supervision that the releasee reside in the county in which:
    
    (1)  the releasee resided at the time of committing the offense for which the releasee was sentenced to the institutional division;  or
    
    (2)  the releasee committed the offense for which the releasee was sentenced to the institutional division, if the releasee was not a resident of this state at the time of committing the offense.
    
    (b)  A parole panel may require a releasee to reside in a county other than the county required under Subsection (a) to:
    
    (1)  protect the life or safety of:
    
    (A)  a victim of the releasee's offense;
    
    (B)  the releasee;
    
    (C)  a witness in the case;  or
    
    (D)  any other person;  or
    
    (2)  increase the likelihood of the releasee's successful completion of parole or mandatory supervision, because of:
    
    (A)  written expressions of significant public concern in the county in which the releasee would otherwise be required to reside;
    
    (B)  the presence of family members or friends in the other county who have expressed a willingness to assist the releasee in successfully completing the conditions of the releasee's parole or mandatory supervision;
    
    (C)  the verified existence of a job offer in the other county;  or
    
    (D)  the availability of a treatment program, educational program, or other social service program in the other county that is not available in the county in which the releasee is otherwise required to reside under Subsection (a).
    
    (c)  At any time after a releasee is released on parole or to mandatory supervision, a parole panel may modify the conditions of parole or mandatory supervision to require the releasee to reside in a county other than the county required by the original conditions.  In making a decision under this subsection, a parole panel must consider the factors listed under Subsection (b).
    
    (d)  If a parole panel initially requires the releasee to reside in a county other than the county required under Subsection (a), the parole panel shall subsequently require the releasee to reside in the county described under Subsection (a) if the requirement that the releasee reside in the other county was based on:
    
    (1)  the verified existence of a job offer under Subsection (b)(2)(C) and the releasee is no longer employed or actively seeking employment;  or
    
    (2)  the availability of a treatment program, educational program, or other social service program under Subsection (b)(2)(D) and the releasee:
    
    (A)  no longer regularly participates in the program as required by a condition of parole or mandatory supervision;  or
    
    (B)  has successfully completed the program but has violated another condition of the releasee's parole or mandatory supervision.
    
    (e)  If a parole panel requires the releasee to reside in a county other than the county required under Subsection (a), the panel shall:
    
    (1)  state in writing the reason for the panel's decision;  and
    
    (2)  place the statement in the releasee's permanent record.
    
    (f)  This section does not apply to a decision by a parole panel to require a releasee to serve the period of parole or mandatory supervision in another state.
    
    (g)  The division shall, on the first working day of each month, notify the sheriff of any county in which the total number of sex offenders under the supervision and control of the division residing in the county exceeds 10 percent of the total number of sex offenders in the state under the supervision and control of the division.  The notice must be provided by e-mail or other electronic communication. If the total number of sex offenders under the supervision and control of the division residing in a county exceeds 22 percent of the total number of sex offenders in the state under the supervision and control of the division, a parole panel may require a sex offender to reside in that county only as required by Subsection (a) or for the reason stated in Subsection (b)(2)(B).  In this subsection, "sex offender" means a person who is released on parole or to mandatory supervision after serving a sentence for an offense described by Section [508.187](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=508.187)(a).
    
    (h)  If a parole panel requires a releasee to reside in a county other than the county required under Subsection (a), the division shall include the reason for residency exemption in the required notification to the sheriff of the county in which the defendant is to reside, the chief of police of the municipality in which the halfway house is located, and the attorney who represents the state in the prosecution of felonies in that county.

Section 1373(c), with a federal law enforcement officer, the determination is considered to be a sufficient hearing to revoke the parole or mandatory supervision without further hearing or determination, except that the parole panel or designated agent shall conduct a hearing to consider mitigating circumstances, if requested by the releasee.
    
    (e)  A parole panel or designated agent of the board may not revoke the parole or mandatory supervision of a releasee if the parole panel or designated agent finds that the only evidence supporting the alleged violation of a condition of release is the uncorroborated results of a polygraph examination.
    
    (f)  Any hearing required to be conducted by a parole panel under this chapter may be conducted by a designated agent of the board.  The designated agent may make recommendations to a parole panel that has responsibility for making a final determination.
