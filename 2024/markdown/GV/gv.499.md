    (b)  If the inmate population of the institutional division reaches 100 percent of capacity or, if the attorney general has authorized an increase in the permissible percentage of capacity under Section [499.109](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=499.109), the inmate population reaches that increased permissible percentage, the director shall immediately notify the executive director, the board, and the attorney general in writing of that fact.

If the Commission on Jail Standards determines that in any county jail in this state there exists an inmate awaiting transfer to the institutional division following conviction of a felony or revocation of probation, parole, or release on mandatory supervision and for whom all paperwork and processing required for transfer have been completed for not less than 45 days, the board may direct the Board of Pardons and Paroles to proceed in the manner described by Subsection (c).
    
    (c)  If the Board of Pardons and Paroles receives a directive from the board under Subsection (b), the Board of Pardons and Paroles acting in parole panels, shall immediately begin to review and consider for early release to intensive supervision parole each eligible inmate who would not at the time of review otherwise be eligible for parole.  The board may impose additional criteria for determining which inmates are eligible for release under this subsection.  A parole panel may not release an inmate under this subsection if the panel determines that the release of the inmate will increase the likelihood of harm to the public, according to objective parole criteria.
