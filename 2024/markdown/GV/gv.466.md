    (c)  At the preliminary hearing, the sales agent must show cause why the license should not remain suspended pending a final hearing on suspension or revocation.   The rules governing a hearing on any other license suspension or revocation under this chapter govern a final administrative hearing under this subsection.

    (2)  the division discovers the sales agent has failed to deposit money received from ticket sales, if the sales agent's license is being summarily suspended under Subsection (a)(1).

(a)  A person may assign, in whole or in part, the right to receive prize payments that are paid by the commission in installments over time if the assignment is made to a person designated by an order of a district court of Travis County, except that a person may not assign the right to receive prize payments if the person is subject to a child support order and is delinquent in making support payments under that order.
    
    (b)  A district court shall issue an order approving a voluntary assignment and directing the commission to direct prize payments in whole or in part to the assignee if:
    
    (1)  a copy of the petition for the order and copies of all notices of any hearing in the matter have been served on the executive director not later than 20 days prior to any hearing or entry of any order.  The commission may intervene in a proceeding to protect the interests of the commission but shall not be considered an indispensable or necessary party.  A petition filed under this section shall include in the caption the prize winner's name as it appears on the lottery claim form;
    
    (2)  the assignment is in writing, executed by the assignor and assignee (or designated agent), and by its terms subject to the laws of this state; and

If married, the assignor shall identify his or her spouse and submit to the court a sworn and notarized statement wherein the spouse consents to the assignment.  If the assignor is married and the sworn and notarized statement is not presented to the court, the court shall determine, to the extent necessary and as appropriate under applicable law, the ability of the assignor to make the proposed assignment without the spouse's consent.
    
    (d)  With respect to any given prize, the order shall also recite and identify all prior assignments by amount of or fraction of payment assigned, the identity of the assignee, and the date(s) of payment(s) assigned.

Unless the commission provides written notice to the assignor and assignee that the commission cannot comply with the court order, the commission shall thereafter make the prize payments in accordance with the court order.
    
    (g)  The commission shall establish and collect a reasonable fee to defray any administrative expenses associated with an assignment made under this section, including the cost to the commission of any processing fee imposed by a private annuity provider.

    (h)  An assignment pursuant to court order may not include or cover payments or portions of payments that are subject to any offset provided by this chapter.
    
    (i)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, there will be no right to assign prize payments following:
    
    (1)  the issuance, by the Internal Revenue Service, of a technical rule letter, revenue ruling, or other public ruling of the Internal Revenue Service that determines that, based on the right of assignment as provided by this section, a lottery prize winner who does not assign prize payments would be subject to an immediate income tax liability for the value of the entire prize rather than annual income tax liability for each installment when paid; or
    
    (2)  the issuance by a court of a published decision holding that, based on the right of assignment as provided by this section, a lottery prize winner who does not assign prize payments would be subject to an immediate income tax liability for the value of the entire prize rather than annual income tax liability for each installment when paid.
