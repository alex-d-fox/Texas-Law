    Sec. 2166.406.  ENERGY SAVINGS PERFORMANCE CONTRACTS.
    
    (a)  In this section, "energy savings performance contract" has the meaning assigned by Section [302.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=302.001), Local Government Code.
    
    (b)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a state agency, without the consent of the commission, may enter into an energy savings performance contract in accordance with this section.
    
    (c)  Each energy or water conservation measure must comply with current local, state, and federal construction, plumbing, and environmental codes and regulations.  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), an energy savings performance contract may not include improvements or equipment that allow or cause water from any condensing, cooling, or industrial process or any system of nonpotable usage over which the public water supply system officials do not have sanitary control to be returned to the potable water supply.
    
    (d)  A state agency may enter into energy savings performance contracts only with a person who is experienced in the design, implementation, and installation of the energy or water conservation measures addressed by the contract.
    
    (e)  Before entering into an energy savings performance contract, a state agency shall require the provider of the energy or water conservation measures to file with the agency a payment and performance bond relating to the installation of the measures in accordance with Chapter [2253](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2253).  The agency may also require a separate bond to cover the value of the guaranteed savings on the contract.
    
    (f)  The state agency may enter into an energy savings performance contract for a period of more than one year only if the state agency finds that the amount the state agency would spend on the energy or water conservation measures will not exceed the amount to be saved in energy, water, wastewater, and operating costs over 20 years from the date of installation.
    
    (f-1)  Notwithstanding other law, the state agency may use any available money to pay the provider of the energy or water conservation measures under this section, and the state agency is not required to pay for such costs solely out of the savings realized by the state agency under an energy savings performance contract.  The state agency may contract with the provider to perform work that is related to, connected with, or otherwise ancillary to the measures identified in the scope of an energy savings performance contract.
    
    (g)  An energy savings performance contract with respect to buildings or facilities may be financed:
    
    (1)  under a lease/purchase contract that has a term not to exceed 20 years from the final date of installation and that meets federal tax requirements for tax-free municipal leasing or long-term financing, including a lease/purchase contract under the master equipment lease purchase program administered by the Texas Public Finance Authority under Chapter [1232](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=1232);
    
    (2)  with the proceeds of bonds; or
    
    (3)  under a contract with the provider of the energy or water conservation measures that has a term not to exceed the lesser of 20 years from the final date of installation or the average useful life of the energy or water conservation or usage measures.
    
    (h)  An energy savings performance contract shall contain provisions requiring the provider of the energy or water conservation measures to guarantee the amount of the savings to be realized by the state agency under the contract.  If the term of the contract exceeds one year, the agency's contractual obligation, including costs of design, engineering, installation, and anticipated debt service, in any one year during the term of the contract beginning after the final date of installation may not exceed the total energy, water, wastewater, and operating cost savings, including electrical, gas, water, wastewater, or other utility cost savings and operating cost savings resulting from the measures, as determined by the state agency in this subsection, divided by the number of years in the contract term.
    
    (i)  An energy savings performance contract shall be let according to the procedures established for procuring certain professional services by Section [2254.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2254.004).  Notice of the request for qualifications shall be given in the manner provided by Section [2156.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2156.002).  The State Energy Conservation Office shall establish guidelines and an approval process for awarding energy savings performance contracts.  The guidelines adopted under this subsection must require that the cost savings projected by an offeror be reviewed by a licensed professional engineer who has a minimum of three years of experience in energy calculation and review, is not an officer or employee of an offeror for the contract under review, and is not otherwise associated with the contract.  In conducting the review, the engineer shall focus primarily on the proposed improvements from an engineering perspective, the methodology and calculations related to cost savings, increases in revenue, and, if applicable, efficiency or accuracy of metering equipment.  An engineer who reviews a contract shall maintain the confidentiality of any proprietary information the engineer acquires while reviewing the contract.  An energy savings performance contract may not be entered into unless the contract has been approved by the State Energy Conservation Office.  Sections [1001.053](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=1001.053) and [1001.407](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=1001.407), Occupations Code, apply to work performed under the contract.
    
    (j)  The legislature shall base an agency's appropriation for energy, water, and wastewater costs during a fiscal year on the sum of:
    
    (1)  the agency's estimated energy, water, and wastewater costs for that fiscal year;  and
    
    (2)  if an energy savings performance contract is in effect, the agency's estimated net savings resulting from the contract during the contract term, divided by the number of years in the contract term.
    
    (k)  Chapter [2269](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2269) does not apply to this section.
    
    (l)  The guidelines adopted under Subsection (i) must require the State Energy Conservation Office to:
    
    (1)  review any reports submitted to the office that measure and verify cost savings to a state agency under an energy savings performance contract; and
    
    (2)  based on the reports, provide an analysis, on a periodic basis, of the cost savings under the energy savings performance contract to the state agency and the Legislative Budget Board until the state agency determines that the analysis is no longer required to accurately measure cost savings.
