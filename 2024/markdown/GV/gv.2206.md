    Sec. 2206.053.  VOTE ON USE OF EMINENT DOMAIN.  (a)  Before a governmental entity initiates a condemnation proceeding by filing a petition under Section [21.012](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=21.012), Property Code, the governmental entity must:
    
    (1)  authorize the initiation of the condemnation proceeding at a public meeting by a record vote; and
    
    (2)  include in the notice for the public meeting as required by Subchapter [C](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=551.041), Chapter [551](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=551), in addition to other information as required by that subchapter, the consideration of the use of eminent domain to condemn property as an agenda item.
    
    (b)  A single ordinance, resolution, or order may be adopted for all units of property to be condemned if:
    
    (1)  the motion required by Subsection (e) indicates that the first record vote applies to all units of property to be condemned; and
    
    (2)  the minutes of the governmental entity reflect that the first vote applies to all of those units.
    
    (c)  If more than one member of the governing body objects to adopting a single ordinance, resolution, or order by a record vote for all units of property for which condemnation proceedings are to be initiated, a separate record vote must be taken for each unit of property.
    
    (d)  For the purposes of Subsections (a) and (c), if two or more units of real property are owned by the same person, the governmental entity may treat those units of property as one unit of property.
    
    (e)  The motion to adopt an ordinance, resolution, or order authorizing the initiation of condemnation proceedings under Chapter [21](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=21), Property Code, must be made in a form substantially similar to the following:  "I move that the (name of governmental entity) authorize the use of the power of eminent domain to acquire (describe the property) for (describe the public use)."  The description of the property required by this subsection is sufficient if the description of the location of and interest in the property that the governmental entity seeks to acquire is substantially similar to the description that is or could properly be used in a petition to condemn the property under Section [21.012](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=21.012), Property Code.

    (g)  An ordinance, resolution, or order adopted under Subsection (f) is not required to identify specific properties that the governmental entity will acquire.  The ordinance, resolution, or order must identify the general area to be covered by the project or the general route that will be used by the governmental entity for the project in a way that provides property owners in and around the area or along the route reasonable notice that the owners' properties may be subject to condemnation proceedings during the planning or construction of the project.
