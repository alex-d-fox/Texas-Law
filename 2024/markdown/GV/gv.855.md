    (a)  In this section, "participant" has the meaning assigned by Section [855.114](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=855.114).
    
    (a-1)  Information contained in records that are in the custody of the retirement system or maintained in the custody of another governmental entity or an administrator or carrier acting in cooperation with or on behalf of the retirement system concerning a participant is confidential and not subject to public disclosure.  Except as otherwise provided by this section, the retirement system is not required to accept or comply with a request for a record or information about a record of a participant, or to seek an opinion from the attorney general because the records of a participant are not public records and are exempt from disclosure and the public information provisions of Chapter [552](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552).  Participant information may not be disclosed unless:
    
    (1)  the information is disclosed to:
    
    (A)  the participant or the participant's attorney, guardian, executor, administrator, conservator, or other person who the director determines is acting in the interest of the participant or the participant's estate;
    
    (B)  a spouse or former spouse of a participant after the director determines that the information is relevant to the spouse's or former spouse's interest in member accounts, benefits, or other amounts payable by the retirement system;
    
    (C)  a governmental official or employee after the director determines that disclosure of the information requested is reasonably necessary to:
    
    (i)  the performance of the duties of the official or employee; or
    
    (ii)  perform the purposes of the retirement system; or
    
    (D)  a person authorized by the participant in writing to receive the information; or
    
    (2)  the information is disclosed pursuant to a subpoena and the director determines that the participant will have a reasonable opportunity to contest the subpoena.
    
    (b)  This section does not prevent the disclosure of the status or identity of an individual as a member, former member, retiree, deceased member or retiree, or beneficiary of the retirement system.
    
    (b-1)  This section does not require the retirement system to compile or disclose a list of participants' names, addresses, social security numbers, or other descriptive or demographic information.
    
    (c)  The director may designate other employees of the retirement system to make the necessary determinations under Subsection (a-1).
    
    (d)  A determination and disclosure under Subsection (a-1) may be made without notice to the participant.
    
    (e)  A record released or received by the retirement system under this section may be transmitted electronically, including through the use of an electronic signature or certification in a form acceptable to the retirement system.  An unintentional disclosure to, or unauthorized access by, a third party related to the transmission or receipt of information under this section is not a violation by the retirement system of any law, including any law or rule relating to the protection of confidential information.
    
    (f)  The records of a participant remain confidential after release to a person, including a governmental official or employee, as authorized by this section.  The records of the participant may become part of a public record of an administrative or judicial proceeding, and the participant waives the confidentiality of the records, including medical records, unless the records are closed to public access by a protective order issued under applicable law.
    
    (g)  The retirement system may require a participant to provide the participant's social security number as the retirement system considers necessary to ensure the proper administration of all services, benefits, plans, and programs under the retirement system's administration or as otherwise required by state or federal law.
    
    (h)  The retirement system has sole discretion in determining if a record is subject to this section.  For purposes of this section, a record includes any record of the retirement system containing information about a participant, living or deceased.

For purposes of the investment authority of the board of trustees under Section [67](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=16.67), Article XVI, Texas Constitution, "security" or "securities" means any investment instrument within the meaning of the term as defined by Section [4001.068](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=4001.068), 15 U.S.C.

    (c)  The board of trustees, in the exercise of its discretion to manage the assets of the retirement system, may select one or more commercial banks or other entities experienced in short-term cash management to invest the system's cash balances through its short-term investment fund or funds and in such short-term securities as the board of trustees determines and as authorized by this section.

A determination of whether the board of trustees has exercised prudence in an investment decision must be made by considering the investment of all of the assets of the trust over which the board has management and control, rather than by considering the prudence of a single investment.  In making investments for the retirement system, the board of trustees shall exercise the judgment and care, under the circumstances, that persons of prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, considering the probable income from the securities and probable safety of their capital.

    (b)  In determining the amount of a member's compensation for a payroll period, the board of trustees may use the rate of annual compensation payable to a member on the first day of the payroll period as the rate for the entire period and may omit deductions from compensation for less than a full payroll period if the employee was not a member on the first day of the period.
    
    (c)  The board of trustees may modify a member's required deduction by an amount that does not exceed one-tenth of one percent of the annual compensation on which the deduction is made.

Section 414), these picked-up contributions are not included as gross income of the employee until such time as they are distributed or made available.  Employee contributions that are picked up as above provided shall be deposited to the individual account of the member and shall be treated for all other purposes of this subtitle in the same manner and with like effect as if the amount had been deducted from the compensation of the employee pursuant to Sections [855.401](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=855.401) and [855.402](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=855.402)(a) through (h);  and picked-up contributions may not be included in calculating the limitations on municipality contribution rates prescribed by Section [855.407](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=855.407) or other provisions of this subtitle.

    (c)  A reduction in the member contribution rate for employees of a participating municipality or in the municipality's matching rate does not reduce the maximum rate of contribution of the municipality.
    
    (d)  If the dates of participation of each department of a municipality are not the same, the governing body of the municipality may request that, to determine the municipality normal contribution rate and prior service contribution rate and to determine the period during which the municipality must fund the obligations charged against its account in the benefit accumulation fund, all of its departments have a single composite participation date.  The actuary shall determine the composite participation date by computing an average weighted according to the number of members entering the retirement system on the actual dates of participation of the departments involved.
    
    (e)  If the combined rates of a municipality's normal contributions and prior service contributions exceed the rate prescribed by Subsection (a), the rate for prior service contributions shall be reduced to the rate that equals the difference between the maximum rate prescribed by Subsection (a) and under Section [855.501](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=855.501), if applicable, and the normal contribution rate for the municipality.
    
    (f)  The governing body of a municipality that is determined by the actuary to be unable to finance all obligations charged against its account in the benefit accumulation fund within the municipality's current amortization period may elect to have the municipality contribute to its account in the benefit accumulation fund at a rate that does not exceed in any year the sum of two percent and the maximum contribution rate specified by Subsection (a) and by Section [855.501](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=855.501), if applicable, and that the actuary annually may determine as necessary to finance the existing levels of benefits before the expiration of the municipality's current amortization period.
    
    (g)  A municipality that begins participation in the retirement system on or after December 31, 1999, and any municipality already participating in the retirement system on that date whose governing body elects to have the municipality do so shall contribute to its account in the benefit accumulation fund at the combined rate of total compensation paid to its employees as the actuary determines is necessary to fund all obligations chargeable to its account in the fund within the municipality's amortization period, regardless of other provisions of this subtitle.
    
    (h)  Subject to Subsection (i), if the board of trustees adopts any actuarial changes, including changes in actuarial assumptions or in actuarial method, that would result in any municipality having an increase in its combined contribution rate of more than one-half of one percent of the total compensation paid to its employees based on its current amortization period, the board may, after consultation with the actuary, take any or all of the following actions:
    
    (1)  phase in the increase in the contribution rate for the municipality over a reasonable period of time;
    
    (2)  increase the period for amortizing the municipality's unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities for a period that does not exceed 30 years; or
    
    (3)  allow the municipality to request in writing an increase in the municipality's amortization period, provided that the new amortization period the municipality may be assigned equals the lesser of:
    
    (A)  the number of years required to limit the increase in the combined rate to one-half of one percent of the total compensation paid to its employees; or
    
    (B)  the maximum number of years, not to exceed 30 years, specified by the board of trustees.
    
    (i)  A municipality may decline to phase in the increase in the municipality's contribution rate or increase the municipality's amortization period under Subsection (h).

On the basis of the result of that investigation, the actuary shall recommend to the board of trustees rates and tables necessary to determine supplemental death benefits contribution rates.  The rates and tables may provide for the anticipated mortality experience of the persons covered under the supplemental death benefits fund and for a contingency reserve.

The rate must be expressed as a percentage of the compensation of members employed by the municipality.  When the rate is approved by the board of trustees, the rate is effective for the calendar year for which it was approved.

The board may adjust future contributions to the supplemental death benefits fund to repay to the general reserves account the transferred amount.
    
    (d)  If the total number of members covered by the supplemental death benefits fund becomes fewer than 4,000, the board of trustees may order that the fund be discontinued and all coverage terminated.  The termination date must be December 31 of a year designated by the board and may not be before the expiration of six months after the date on which the order of termination was adopted.
    
    (e)  To protect against adverse claim experience, the board of trustees may secure reinsurance from one or more stock insurance companies doing business in this state if the board determines that reinsurance is necessary.
