    (1)  the average monthly contribution during the member's term of qualified service with all participating departments under this subtitle, not including a contribution to reduce the unfunded accrued actuarial liability of the pension system; and
    
    (2)  a formula adopted by the state board by rule that allows the pension system, assuming maximum state contributions are provided under Section [865.015](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=865.015), to be maintained as actuarially sound.

    Sec. 864.004.  TEMPORARY DISABILITY RETIREMENT BENEFITS.  (a)  A member is entitled to disability retirement benefits from the pension system only if a local board determines that the member became disabled during the performance of emergency services or support services and is unable to return to work at the member's regular occupation or, if the member is a student, is unable to return to the member's scholastic studies.  A disabled member must, at the time of disability, elect between a service retirement annuity or disability retirement benefits, if eligible for both.
    
    (b)  Subject to Subsection (c), a member described by Subsection (a) who does not elect to receive a service retirement annuity is entitled to a temporary disability retirement benefit of:
    
    (1)  $300 per month; or
    
    (2)  a greater amount that the state board by rule adopts based on the monthly contributions made for the members by the governing body of the political subdivision.
    
    (c)  Except as provided by Section [864.005](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=864.005), a temporary disability retirement benefit under Subsection (b) must cease on the expiration of a period, not to exceed one year, determined to be the likely duration of the disability by a physician in a written statement to the local board.

    Sec. 864.005.  CERTIFICATION AND CONTINUANCE OF DISABILITY.
    
    (a)  A local board may require a member who is receiving a temporary disability retirement benefit to file a disability rating report every three months from a physician chosen by the local board.  If a report indicates a significant improvement in condition, the local board, after notice and a hearing, may adopt an order to terminate temporary disability retirement benefit payments.  The local board shall send a copy of each order adopted under this subsection to the executive director.
    
    (b)  Temporary disability benefits cease if:

    (2)  performs emergency services or support services for any participating department; or
    
    (3)  rejects a suitable offer of employment, as determined by the local board.
    
    (f)  If the state board has reason to believe that a ground for termination of a continuing disability retirement annuity exists, the state board shall set a date for a hearing on the continuation or termination of the annuity.

    (b)  The pension system is not required to change the recipient of benefits under this section unless it receives actual notice of the conviction of a beneficiary.
