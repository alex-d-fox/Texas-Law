For the purposes of this section an emergency exists in the following situations:
    
    (1)  a riot or unlawful assembly by three or more persons acting together by use of force or violence;
    
    (2)  if a clear and present danger of the use of violence exists;  or

    Sec. 433.002.  ISSUANCE OF DIRECTIVES.  (a)  After a state of emergency is proclaimed, the governor may issue reasonable directives calculated to control effectively and terminate the emergency and protect life and property.  Before a directive takes effect, reasonable notice must be given in a newspaper of general circulation in the affected area, through television or radio serving the affected area, or by circulating notices or posting signs at conspicuous places in the affected area.
    
    (b)  The directive may provide for:
    
    (1)  control of public and private transportation in the affected area;
    
    (2)  designation of specific zones in the affected area in which, if necessary, the use and occupancy of buildings and vehicles may be controlled;
    
    (3)  control of the movement of persons;
    
    (4)  control of places of amusement or assembly;
    
    (5)  establishment of curfews;

    (7)  control of the storage, use, and transportation of explosives or flammable materials considered dangerous to public safety, other than explosives or flammable materials that are components of firearm ammunition.
    
    (c)  A directive takes effect according to its terms, but not before notice is given as required by Subsection (a).  The governor may amend, modify, or rescind a directive in a manner similar to adoption of a directive during the state of emergency.
