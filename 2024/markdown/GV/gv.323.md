    (b)  At the request of a state agency, the council may determine whether and the extent to which council resources are available to contract or otherwise agree with the agency to perform a statistical or demographic analysis of information for the agency or to assist the agency in performing the analysis.  A reference in this section to performing an analysis includes assisting an agency to perform the analysis.
    
    (c)  Except as provided by this section, information that the council acquires or produces in relation to a statistical or demographic analysis performed under Subsection (b) is confidential and not public information subject to Chapter [552](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552), including:
    
    (1)  any information that identifies or tends to identify an individual or other entity that submitted information or that was asked to submit information for the analysis;
    
    (2)  working drafts and working papers developed in performing the analysis;
    
    (3)  contracts and subcontracts entered into for purposes of performing the analysis;
    
    (4)  internal and interagency correspondence sent or received in the course of performing the analysis;
    
    (5)  memoranda of understanding entered into in relation to performing the analysis;  and
    
    (6)  data, data files, databases, computer coding, computer specification programs, data use agreements, and data dictionaries acquired or used in performing the analysis.
    
    (d)  Without regard to whether the council collects information for purposes of performing a statistical or demographic analysis of information under Subsection (b) indirectly through the state agency or directly from another governmental or nongovernmental entity, an individual or other entity that voluntarily provides information to the state agency or to the council for purposes of the analysis does not waive any exception from required disclosure or any privilege not to disclose the information, and the character of the information as privileged or excepted from required disclosure is not affected by that action of the individual or other entity.
    
    (e)  A final report containing a statistical or demographic analysis of information performed under Subsection (b), a cover letter or cover memorandum for the final report, and an announcement that the final report is available are not confidential and are subject to required public disclosure under Chapter [552](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552) except to the extent that the final report, cover letter or cover memorandum, or announcement contains information that identifies or tends to identify an individual or entity other than information that names a staff member who performed work in relation to performing the analysis or that names government officials on a letterhead.
    
    (f)  Notwithstanding Subsection (c)(3), a contract or other agreement between the council and a state agency under Subsection (b) and the names of the staff members who perform work in relation to performing the analysis under the contract or agreement are not confidential.  A contract or agreement between the council and a state agency under Subsection (b) is public information subject to Chapter [552](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552).
    
    (g)  Information that an individual or other entity submits for the purpose of a statistical or demographic analysis of information performed by the council under Subsection (b) may not be used against the individual or other entity in a state agency enforcement proceeding.  This subsection does not affect the ability of a state agency to obtain the information by other means and to use the information, if obtained by other means, in a state agency enforcement proceeding.
