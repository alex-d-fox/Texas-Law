    (1)  the governing body of the state governmental entity approves the contract and the approved contract is signed by the presiding officer of the governing body;  or

If the state governmental entity finds under Subsection (d)(3) that the state governmental entity does not have appropriated funds available to pay the estimated amounts required under a contract for the legal services providing only for the payment of hourly fees, the state governmental entity may not enter into the proposed contract in its own name or in the name of the state unless the Legislative Budget Board finds that the state governmental entity's finding with regard to available appropriated funds is correct.
    
    (f)  A contingent fee contract for legal services that is subject to Subsection (e) and requires a finding by the Legislative Budget Board is void unless the board has made the finding required by Subsection (e).

    Sec. 2254.106.  CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS:  COMPUTATION OF CONTINGENT FEE;  REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES.  (a)  The contract must establish the reasonable hourly rate for work performed by an attorney, law clerk, or paralegal who will perform legal or support services under the contract based on the reasonable and customary rate in the relevant locality for the type of work performed and on the relevant experience, demonstrated ability, and standard hourly billing rate, if any, of the person performing the work.  The contract may establish the reasonable hourly rate for one or more persons by name and may establish a rate schedule for work performed by unnamed persons.  The highest hourly rate for a named person or under a rate schedule may not exceed $1,000 an hour.  This subsection applies to subcontracted work performed by an attorney, law clerk, or paralegal who is not a contracting attorney or a partner, shareholder, or employee of a contracting attorney or law firm as well as to work performed by a contracting attorney or by a partner, shareholder, or employee of a contracting attorney or law firm.
    
    (b)  The contract must establish a base fee to be computed as follows.  For each attorney, law clerk, or paralegal who is a contracting attorney or a partner, shareholder, or employee of a contracting attorney or law firm, multiply the number of hours the attorney, law clerk, or paralegal works in providing legal or support services under the contract times the reasonable hourly rate for the work performed by that attorney, law clerk, or paralegal.  Add the resulting amounts to obtain the base fee.  The computation of the base fee may not include hours or costs attributable to work performed by a person who is not a contracting attorney or a partner, shareholder, or employee of a contracting attorney or law firm.
    
    (c)  Subject to Subsection (d), the contingent fee is computed by multiplying the base fee by a multiplier.  The contract must establish a reasonable multiplier based on any expected difficulties in performing the contract, the amount of expenses expected to be risked by the contractor, the expected risk of no recovery, and any expected long delay in recovery.  The multiplier may not exceed four without prior approval by the legislature.
    
    (d)  In addition to establishing the method of computing the fee under Subsections (a), (b), and (c), the contract must limit the amount of the contingent fee to a stated percentage of the amount recovered.  The contract may state different percentage limitations for different ranges of possible recoveries and different percentage limitations in the event the matter is settled, tried, or tried and appealed.  The percentage limitation may not exceed 35 percent without prior approval by the legislature.  The contract must state that the amount of the contingent fee will not exceed the lesser of the stated percentage of the amount recovered or the amount computed under Subsections (a), (b), and (c).
    
    (e)  The contract also may:
    
    (1)  limit the amount of expenses that may be reimbursed;  and
    
    (2)  provide that the amount or payment of only part of the fee is contingent on the outcome of the matter for which the services were obtained, with the amount and payment of the remainder of the fee payable on a regular hourly rate basis without regard to the outcome of the matter.
    
    (f)  Except as provided by Section [2254.107](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2254.107), this section does not apply to a contingent fee contract for legal services:
    
    (1)  in which the expected amount to be recovered and the actual amount recovered do not exceed $100,000;  or
    
    (2)  under which a series of recoveries is contemplated and the amount of each individual recovery is not expected to and does not exceed $100,000.
    
    (g)  This section applies to a contract described by Subsection (f) for each individual recovery under the contract that actually exceeds $100,000, and the contract must provide for computing the fee in accordance with this section for each individual recovery that actually exceeds $100,000.

(a)  Except as provided by Subsection (b), a contingent fee and a reimbursement of an expense under a contract with a state governmental entity is payable only from funds the legislature specifically appropriates to pay the fee or reimburse the expense.  An appropriation to pay the fee or reimburse the expense must specifically describe the individual contract, or the class of contracts classified by subject matter, on account of which the fee is payable or expense is reimbursable.  A general reference to contingent fee contracts for legal services or to contracts subject to this subchapter or a similar general description is not a sufficient description for purposes of this subsection.
    
    (b)  If the legislature has not specifically appropriated funds for paying the fee or reimbursing the expense, a state governmental entity may pay the fee or reimburse the expense from other available funds only if:
    
    (1)  the legislature is not in session;  and
    
    (2)  the Legislative Budget Board gives its prior approval for that payment or reimbursement under Section [69](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=16.69), Article XVI, Texas Constitution, after examining the statement required under Section [2254.104](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2254.104)(c) and determining that the requested payment and the contract under which payment is requested meet all the requirements of this subchapter.
    
    (c)  A payment or reimbursement under the contract may not be made until:
    
    (1)  final and unappealable arrangements have been made for depositing all recovered funds to the credit of the appropriate fund or account in the state treasury;  and
    
    (2)  the state governmental entity and the state auditor have received from the contracting attorney or law firm the statement required under Section [2254.104](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2254.104)(c).
    
    (d)  Litigation and other expenses payable under the contract, including expenses attributable to attorney, paralegal, accountant, expert, or other professional work performed by a person who is not a contracting attorney or a partner, shareholder, or employee of a contracting attorney or law firm, may be reimbursed only if the state governmental entity or political subdivision and, if applicable, the entity's or subdivision's auditor determine that the expenses were reasonable, proper, necessary, actually incurred on behalf of the state governmental entity or political subdivision, and paid for by the contracting attorney or law firm.  The contingent fee may not be paid until the entity's or subdivision's auditor or the governing body of a political subdivision without an auditor, as applicable, has reviewed the relevant time and expense records and verified that the hours of work on which the fee computation is based were actually worked in performing reasonable and necessary services for the state governmental entity or political subdivision under the contract.
