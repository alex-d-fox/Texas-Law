The execution of the comprehensive agreement or an amendment to the agreement is conclusive evidence that the user fee, lease payment, or service payment complies with this chapter.  A user fee or lease payment established in the comprehensive agreement as a source of revenue may be in addition to, or in lieu of, a service payment.

    (3)  provisions in which the authority and duties of the contracting person under this chapter cease and the qualifying project is dedicated for public use to the responsible governmental entity or, if the qualifying project was initially dedicated by an affected jurisdiction, to the affected jurisdiction.
    
    (e)  Any change in the terms of the comprehensive agreement that the parties agree to must be added to the comprehensive agreement by written amendment.
    
    (f)  The comprehensive agreement may provide for the development or operation of phases or segments of the qualifying project.
    
    (g)  The comprehensive agreement must provide that a security document or other instrument purporting to mortgage, pledge, encumber, or create a lien, charge, or security interest on or against the contracting party's interest may not extend to or affect the fee simple interest of the state in the qualifying project or the state's rights or interests under the comprehensive agreement.  Any holder of debt shall acknowledge that the mortgage, pledge, or encumbrance or a lien, charge, or security interest on or against the contracting party's interest is subordinate to the fee simple interest of the state in the qualifying project.
