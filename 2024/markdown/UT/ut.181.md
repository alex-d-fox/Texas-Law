    (c)  The monetary rates applicable to an electric cooperative or electric cooperative affiliate for attaching broadband facilities on the electric cooperative's poles must be just and reasonable and may not be less than the monetary rates the electric cooperative charges to other broadband service providers for attaching broadband facilities to the electric cooperative's poles.

    (e)  Subject to Subsection (f), not later than the 60th day before the date the electric cooperative or electric cooperative affiliate begins construction in an easement or other property right that existed before that date of fiber optic cables and other facilities for providing broadband service, the electric cooperative or electric cooperative affiliate must provide written notice to the owners of property in which the easement or property right is located of the intent to use the easement or other property right for broadband service.  The electric cooperative or electric cooperative affiliate shall send the notice by first class mail to the last known address of each person in whose name the property is listed on the most recent tax roll of each county authorized to levy property taxes against the property.  The notice must state whether any new fiber optic cables used for broadband service will be located above or below ground in the easement or other property right.
