    TITLE 2. PUBLIC UTILITY REGULATORY ACT
    
      
    
    
    SUBTITLE B. ELECTRIC UTILITIES
    
      
    
    
    CHAPTER 39. RESTRUCTURING OF ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY
    
      
    
    
    SUBCHAPTER A. GENERAL PROVISIONS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 39.001.  LEGISLATIVE POLICY AND PURPOSE.  (a)  The legislature finds that the production and sale of electricity is not a monopoly warranting regulation of rates, operations, and services and that the public interest in competitive electric markets requires that, except for transmission and distribution services and for the recovery of stranded costs, electric services and their prices should be determined by customer choices and the normal forces of competition.  As a result, this chapter is enacted to protect the public interest during the transition to and in the establishment of a fully competitive electric power industry.
    
    (b)  The legislature finds that it is in the public interest to:
    
    (1)  implement on January 1, 2002, a competitive retail electric market that allows each retail customer to choose the customer's provider of electricity and that encourages full and fair competition among all providers of electricity;
    
    (2)  allow utilities with uneconomic generation-related assets and purchased power contracts to recover the reasonable excess costs over market of those assets and purchased power contracts;
    
    (3)  educate utility customers about anticipated changes in the provision of retail electric service to ensure that the benefits of the competitive market reach all customers;  and
    
    (4)  protect the competitive process in a manner that ensures the confidentiality of competitively sensitive information during the transition to a competitive market and after the commencement of customer choice.
    
    (c)  Regulatory authorities, excluding the governing body of a municipally owned electric utility that has not opted for customer choice or the body vested with power to manage and operate a municipally owned electric utility that has not opted for customer choice, may not make rules or issue orders regulating competitive electric services, prices, or competitors or restricting or conditioning competition except as authorized in this title and may not discriminate against any participant or type of participant during the transition to a competitive market and in the competitive market.
    
    (d)  Regulatory authorities, excluding the governing body of a municipally owned electric utility that has not opted for customer choice or the body vested with power to manage and operate a municipally owned electric utility that has not opted for customer choice, shall authorize or order competitive rather than regulatory methods to achieve the goals of this chapter to the greatest extent feasible and shall adopt rules and issue orders that are both practical and limited so as to impose the least impact on competition.
    
    (e)  Judicial review of competition rules adopted by the commission shall be conducted under Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code, except as otherwise provided by this chapter.  Judicial review of the validity of competition rules shall be commenced in the Court of Appeals for the Fifteenth Court of Appeals District and shall be limited to the commission's rulemaking record.  The rulemaking record consists of:
    
    (1)  the notice of the proposed rule;
    
    (2)  the comments of all interested persons;
    
    (3)  all studies, reports, memoranda, or other materials on which the commission relied in adopting the rule; and
    
    (4)  the order adopting the rule.
    
    (f)  A person who challenges the validity of a competition rule must file a notice of appeal with the court of appeals and serve the notice on the commission not later than the 15th day after the date on which the rule as adopted is published in the Texas Register.  The notice of appeal shall designate the person challenging the rule as the appellant and the commission as the appellee.  The commission shall prepare the rulemaking record and file it with the court of appeals not later than the 30th day after the date the notice of appeal is served on the commission.  The court of appeals shall hear and determine each appeal as expeditiously as possible with lawful precedence over other matters.  The appellant, and any person who is permitted by the court to intervene in support of the appellant's claims, shall file and serve briefs not later than the 30th day after the date the commission files the rulemaking record.  The commission, and any person who is permitted by the court to intervene in support of the rule, shall file and serve briefs not later than the 60th day after the date the appellant files the appellant's brief.  The court of appeals may, on its own motion or on motion of any person for good cause, modify the filing deadlines prescribed by this subsection.  The court of appeals shall render judgment affirming the rule or reversing and, if appropriate on reversal, remanding the rule to the commission for further proceedings, consistent with the court's opinion and judgment.  The Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure apply to an appeal brought under this section to the extent not inconsistent with this section.

    SUBCHAPTER B. TRANSITION TO COMPETITIVE RETAIL ELECTRIC MARKET
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 39.051.  UNBUNDLING.  (a)  On or before September 1, 2000, each electric utility shall separate from its regulated utility activities its customer energy services business activities that are otherwise also already widely available in the competitive market.
    
    (b)  Not later than January 1, 2002, each electric utility shall separate its business activities from one another into the following units:
    
    (1)  a power generation company;
    
    (2)  a retail electric provider;  and
    
    (3)  a transmission and distribution utility.
    
    (c)  An electric utility may accomplish the separation required by Subsection (b) either through the creation of separate nonaffiliated companies or separate affiliated companies owned by a common holding company or through the sale of assets to a third party.  An electric utility may create separate transmission and distribution utilities.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, an electric utility that does not have stranded costs described by Section [39.254](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.254) and that on September 1, 2005, has not finalized unbundling pursuant to a commission order approving an unbundling plan may also meet the requirements of Subsection (b) for generation facilities existing on September 1, 2005, in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas if it meets and maintains compliance with the following requirements:
    
    (1)  the electric utility has no more than 400 megawatts of Texas jurisdictional capacity from generating units within the Electric Reliability Council of Texas that have not been mothballed or retired;
    
    (2)  the electric utility has a contract or contracts with separate nonaffiliated companies or separate affiliated companies for the sale of all of the output from its generating units that have not been mothballed or retired with a contract term that is no shorter than 20 years or the life of the generating units, whichever is shorter; and
    
    (3)  the electric utility has a separate division within the electric utility for its generation business activities.
    
    (c-1)  A separate division described by Subsection (c)(3) is subject to Subsection (d) and, for the purposes of this chapter, is considered a separate affiliated power generation company and a competitive affiliate.
    
    (d)  Each electric utility shall unbundle under this section in a manner that provides for a separation of personnel, information flow, functions, and operations, consistent with Section [39.157](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.157)(d).
    
    (e)  Each electric utility shall file with the commission a plan to implement this section by January 10, 2000.
    
    (f)  The commission shall adopt the utility's plan for business separation required by Subsection (b), adopt the plan with changes, or reject the plan and require the utility to file a new plan.
    
    (g)  Transactions by electric utilities involving sales, transfers, or other disposition of assets to accomplish the purposes of this section are not subject to Section [14.101](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=14.101), [35.034](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=35.034), or [35.035](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=35.035).

    (b)  Nothing in Sections [39.052](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.052)(c) and (d) shall be construed to restrict any customer's right to complain during the freeze period to the regulatory authority regarding the quality of retail electric service provided by the electric utility or the applicability of an electric utility's particular tariff to the customer.
    
    (c)  Nothing in this title shall be construed to restrict an electric utility, voluntarily and at its sole discretion, from offering new services or new tariff options to its customers during the freeze period, consistent with Section [39.051](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.051)(a).

    Sec. 39.101.  CUSTOMER SAFEGUARDS.  (a)  Before customer choice begins on January 1, 2002, the commission shall ensure that retail customer protections are established that entitle a customer:
    
    (1)  to safe, reliable, and reasonably priced electricity, including protection against service disconnections in an extreme weather emergency as provided by Subsection (h) or in cases of medical emergency or nonpayment for unrelated services;
    
    (2)  to privacy of customer consumption and credit information;
    
    (3)  to bills presented in a clear format and in language readily understandable by customers;
    
    (4)  to the option to have all electric services on a single bill, except in those instances where multiple bills are allowed under Chapters [40](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=40) and [41](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=41);

    (c)  A retail electric provider, power generation company, aggregator, or other entity that provides retail electric service may not refuse to provide retail electric or electric generation service or otherwise discriminate in the provision of electric service to any customer because of race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, marital status, lawful source of income, disability, or familial status.  A retail electric provider, power generation company, aggregator, or other entity that provides retail electric service may not refuse to provide retail electric or electric generation service to a customer because the customer is located in an economically distressed geographic area or qualifies for low-income affordability or energy efficiency services.  The commission shall require a provider to comply with this subsection as a condition of certification or registration.
    
    (d)  A retail electric provider, power generation company, aggregator, or other entity that provides retail electric service shall submit reports to the commission and the office annually and on request relating to the person's compliance with this section.  The commission by rule shall specify the form in which a report must be submitted.  A report must include:
    
    (1)  information regarding the extent of the person's coverage;
    
    (2)  information regarding the service provided, compiled by zip code and census tract;  and
    
    (3)  any other information the commission or the office considers relevant to determine compliance.
    
    (e)  The commission has the authority to adopt and enforce such rules as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out Subsections (a)-(d), including rules for minimum service standards for a retail electric provider relating to customer deposits and the extension of credit, switching fees, levelized billing programs, interconnection and use of on-site generation, termination of service, and quality of service.  The commission has jurisdiction over all providers of electric service in enforcing Subsections (a)-(d) and may assess civil and administrative penalties under Section [15.023](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=15.023) and seek civil penalties under Section [15.028](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=15.028).
    
    (f)  On or before June 30, 2001, the commission shall modify its current rules regarding customer protections to ensure that at least the same level of customer protection against potential abuses and the same quality of service that exists on December 31, 1999, is maintained in a restructured electric industry.
    
    (g)  Compliance with Subsections (a)-(e) by a provider of electric service which is a municipally owned utility shall be administered solely by the governing body of the municipally owned utility, which shall adopt, implement, and enforce, as to the municipally owned utility, rules having the effect of accomplishing the objectives of Subsections (a)-(e).  Reports containing the information required by Subsection (d) shall be filed by the municipally owned utility with the governing body.
    
    (h)  A retail electric provider, power generation company, aggregator, or other entity that provides retail electric service may not disconnect service to a residential customer during an extreme weather emergency or on a weekend day.  The entity providing service shall defer collection of the full payment of bills that are due during an extreme weather emergency until after the emergency is over and shall work with customers to establish a pay schedule for deferred bills.  For purposes of this subsection, "extreme weather emergency" means a period when:
    
    (1)  the previous day's highest temperature did not exceed 32 degrees Fahrenheit and the temperature is predicted to remain at or below that level for the next 24 hours according to the nearest National Weather Service reports;  or
    
    (2)  the National Weather Service issues a heat advisory for any county in the relevant service territory, or when such an advisory has been issued on any one of the previous two calendar days.

    (b)  The affiliated retail electric provider of the electric utility serving a retail customer on December 31, 2001, may continue to serve that customer until the customer chooses service from a different retail electric provider, an electric cooperative offering customer choice, or a municipally owned utility offering customer choice.
    
    (c)  An electric utility that has in effect a systemwide freeze for residential and commercial customers in effect September 1, 1997, extending beyond December 31, 2001, that has been found by a regulatory authority to be in the public interest is not subject to this chapter.  At the expiration of the utility's freeze period, the utility shall be subject to this chapter and, at that time, has no claim for stranded cost recovery.
    
    (d)  The commission shall oversee the compliance with this chapter by electric utilities that were not subject to this chapter before September 1, 2003, and in so doing shall establish schedules and procedures and require commission approvals as it deems necessary to achieve the objectives of this chapter.  This subsection does not apply to an electric utility to which Subsection (c) applies.
    
    (e)  In establishing a schedule under Subsection (d), the commission shall consider:
    
    (1)  the effect of customer choice on the reliability of service provided by the electric utility;
    
    (2)  whether the electric utility's service area is located in more than one power region;

    (e)  Each utility operating a pilot project under this section shall charge residential and small commercial customers in accordance with Section [39.052](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.052).
    
    (f)  The commission may prescribe reporting requirements it considers necessary to evaluate a pilot project consistent with the purpose of this section.

    Sec. 39.107.  METERING AND BILLING SERVICES.  (a)  On introduction of customer choice in a service area, metering services for the area shall continue to be provided by the transmission and distribution utility affiliate of the electric utility that was serving the area before the introduction of customer choice.  Metering services provided to commercial and industrial customers that are required by the independent system operator to have an interval data recorder meter may be provided on a competitive basis.
    
    (b)  Metering services provided to residential customers and to nonresidential customers other than those required by the independent system operator to have an interval data recorder meter shall continue to be provided by the transmission and distribution utility affiliate of the electric utility that was serving the area before the introduction of customer choice.  Retail electric providers serving residential and nonresidential customers other than those required by the independent system operator to have an interval data recorder meter may request that the transmission and distribution utility provide specialized meters, meter features, or add-on accessories so long as they are technically feasible and generally available in the market and provided that the retail electric provider pays the differential cost of such a meter or accessory.  Metering and billing services provided to residential customers shall be governed by the customer safeguards adopted by the commission under Section [39.101](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.101).  All meter data, including all data generated, provided, or otherwise made available, by advanced meters and meter information networks, shall belong to a customer, including data used to calculate charges for service, historical load data, and any other proprietary customer information.  A customer may authorize its data to be provided to one or more retail electric providers under rules and charges established by the commission.
    
    (c)  Beginning on the date of introduction of customer choice in a service area, tenants of leased or rented property that is separately metered shall have the right to choose a retail electric provider, an electric cooperative offering customer choice, or a municipally owned utility offering customer choice, and the owner of the property must grant reasonable and nondiscriminatory access to transmission and distribution utilities, retail electric providers, electric cooperatives, and municipally owned utilities for metering purposes.
    
    (d)  Beginning on the date of introduction of customer choice in a service area, a transmission and distribution utility, or an electric cooperative or municipally owned utility providing the customer's energy requirements shall bill a customer's retail electric provider for nonbypassable delivery charges as determined under Section [39.201](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.201).  The retail electric provider or the electric cooperative or municipally owned utility, as appropriate, must pay these charges.
    
    (e)  A transmission and distribution utility may bill retail customers at the request of a retail electric provider or, if an electric cooperative or municipally owned utility is providing the customer's energy requirements, at the request of the electric cooperative or municipally owned utility.  A transmission and distribution utility that provides billing service on such request shall offer billing service on comparable terms and conditions to those of any such requesting retail electric provider or, as applicable, the electric cooperative or municipally owned utility providing energy requirements to a customer served by the transmission and distribution utility.
    
    (f)  Beginning on the date of introduction of customer choice in a service area, any charges for metering and billing services shall comply with rules adopted by the commission relating to nondiscriminatory rates of service.
    
    (g)  Metered electric service sold to residential customers on a prepaid basis may not be sold at a price that is higher than the price charged by the provider of last resort.
    
    (h)  The commission shall establish a nonbypassable surcharge for an electric utility or transmission and distribution utility to use to recover reasonable and necessary costs incurred in deploying advanced metering and meter information networks to residential customers and nonresidential customers other than those required by the independent system operator to have an interval data recorder meter.  The commission shall ensure that the nonbypassable surcharge reflects a deployment of advanced meters that is no more than one-third of the utility's total meters over each calendar year and shall ensure that the nonbypassable surcharge does not result in the utility recovering more than its actual, fully allocated meter and meter information network costs.  The expenses must be allocated to the customer classes receiving the services, based on the electric utility's most recently approved tariffs.
    
    (i)  Subject to the restrictions in Subsection (h), it is the intent of the legislature that net metering and advanced meter information networks be deployed as rapidly as possible to allow customers to better manage energy use and control costs, and to facilitate demand response initiatives.
    
    (j)  Notwithstanding Subsection (b), a nonresidential customer may have a meter installed and metering services provided on a competitive basis as part of an energy savings performance contract.
    
    (k)  The commission by rule shall prohibit an electric utility or transmission and distribution utility from selling, sharing, or disclosing information generated, provided, or otherwise collected from an advanced metering system or meter information network, including information used to calculate charges for service, historical load data, and any other customer information. The commission shall allow an electric utility or transmission and distribution utility to share information with an affiliated corporation, or other third-party entity, if the information is to be used only for the purpose of providing electric utility service to the customer or other customer-approved services.

    Sec. 39.112.  NOTICE OF EXPIRATION AND PRICE CHANGE.  (a)  In this section, "fixed rate product" means a retail electric product with a term of at least three months for which the price for each billing period, including recurring charges, does not change throughout the term of the contract, except that the price may vary to reflect actual changes in transmission and distribution utility charges, changes to ERCOT or Texas Regional Entity administrative fees charged to loads, or changes to federal, state, or local laws that result in new or modified fees or costs that are not within the retail electric provider's control.
    
    (b)  A retail electric provider shall provide a residential customer who has a fixed rate product with at least three written notices of the date the fixed rate product will expire. The notices must be provided during the last third of the contract period and in intervals that allow for, as practicable, even distribution of the notices throughout the last third of the contract period.

    (j)  If a retail electric provider does not provide notice of the expiration of a customer's contract with the provider in accordance with this section and the customer does not select another retail electric product before the expiration of the customer's contract term with the provider, the retail electric provider must continue to serve the customer under the pricing terms of the fixed rate product contract until:
    
    (1)  the provider provides notice of the expiration of the contract in accordance with this section; or
    
    (2)  the customer selects another retail electric product.

    Sec. 39.151.  ESSENTIAL ORGANIZATIONS.  (a)  A power region must establish one or more independent organizations to perform the following functions:
    
    (1)  ensure access to the transmission and distribution systems for all buyers and sellers of electricity on nondiscriminatory terms;
    
    (2)  ensure the reliability and adequacy of the regional electrical network;
    
    (3)  ensure that information relating to a customer's choice of retail electric provider is conveyed in a timely manner to the persons who need that information;  and
    
    (4)  ensure that electricity production and delivery are accurately accounted for among the generators and wholesale buyers and sellers in the region.
    
    (b)  "Independent organization" means an independent system operator or other person that is sufficiently independent of any producer or seller of electricity that its decisions will not be unduly influenced by any producer or seller. 
    
    (c)  The commission shall certify an independent organization or organizations to perform the functions prescribed by this section.  The commission shall apply the provisions of this section and Sections [39.1511](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.1511), [39.1512](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.1512), and [39.1515](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.1515) so as to avoid conflict with a ruling of a federal regulatory body.
    
    (d)  The commission shall adopt and enforce rules relating to the reliability of the regional electrical network and accounting for the production and delivery of electricity among generators and all other market participants, or may delegate those responsibilities to an independent organization. An independent organization certified by the commission is directly responsible and accountable to the commission.  The commission has complete authority to oversee and investigate the independent organization's finances, budget, and operations as necessary to ensure the organization's accountability and to ensure that the organization adequately performs the organization's functions and duties.  The independent organization shall fully cooperate with the commission in the commission's oversight and investigatory functions.  The commission may take appropriate action against an independent organization that does not adequately perform the organization's functions or duties or does not comply with this section, including decertifying the organization or assessing an administrative penalty against the organization.  The commission by rule shall adopt procedures governing decertification of an independent organization, selecting and certifying a successor organization, and transferring assets to the successor organization to ensure continuity of operations in the region.  The commission may not implement, by order or by rule, a requirement that is contrary to an applicable federal law or rule.
    
    (d-1)  The commission shall require an independent organization certified by the commission under this section to submit to the commission the organization's entire proposed annual budget.  The commission shall review the proposed budgets either annually or biennially and may approve, disapprove, or modify any item included in a proposed budget.  The commission by rule shall establish the type of information or documents needed to effectively evaluate the proposed budget and reasonable dates for the submission of that information or those documents.  The commission shall establish a procedure to provide public notice of and public participation in the budget review process.
    
    (d-2)  Except as otherwise agreed to by the commission and an independent organization certified by the commission under this section, the organization must submit to the commission for review and approval proposals for obtaining debt financing or for refinancing existing debt.  The commission may approve, disapprove, or modify a proposal.
    
    (d-3)  An independent organization certified by the commission under this section shall develop proposed performance measures to track the organization's operations.  The independent organization must submit the proposed performance measures to the commission for review and approval.  The commission shall review the organization's performance as part of the budget review process under Subsection (d-1).  The commission shall prepare a report at the time the commission approves the organization's budget detailing the organization's performance and submit the report to the lieutenant governor, the speaker of the house of representatives, and each house and senate standing committee that has jurisdiction over electric utility issues.
    
    (d-4)  The commission may:
    
    (1)  require an independent organization to provide reports and information relating to the independent organization's performance of the functions prescribed by this section and relating to the organization's revenues, expenses, and other financial matters;
    
    (2)  prescribe a system of accounts for an independent organization;

    (6)  resolve disputes between an affected person and an independent organization and adopt procedures for the efficient resolution of such disputes.
    
    (e)  After approving the budget of an independent organization under Subsection (d-1), the commission shall authorize the organization to charge to wholesale buyers and sellers a system administration fee, within a range determined by the commission, that is reasonable and competitively neutral to fund the independent organization's approved budget.  The commission shall investigate the organization's cost efficiencies, salaries and benefits, and use of debt financing and may require the organization to provide any information needed to effectively evaluate the reasonableness and neutrality of the fee or to evaluate the effectiveness or efficiency of the organization.  The commission shall work with the organization to establish the detail of information, both current and historical, and the time frames the commission needs to effectively evaluate the fee.  The commission shall require the organization to closely match actual revenues generated by the fee and other sources of revenue with revenue necessary to fund the budget, taking into account the effect of a fee change on market participants and consumers, to ensure that the budget year does not end with surplus or insufficient funds.  The commission shall require the organization to submit to the commission, on a schedule determined by the commission, reports that compare actual expenditures with budgeted expenditures.
    
    (e-1)  The review and approval of a proposed budget under Subsection (d-1) or a proceeding to authorize and set the range for the amount of a fee under Subsection (e) is not a contested case for purposes of Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code.

The independent organization may not substantially modify the market monitor's contract unless the modification is approved by a majority of the commissioners.
    
    (b)  The independent organization shall provide to the personnel of the market monitor:
    
    (1)  full access to the organization's main operations center and the organization's records that concern operations, settlement, and reliability; and

    (d)  The commission is responsible for ensuring that the market monitor has the resources, expertise, and authority necessary to monitor the wholesale electric market effectively and shall adopt rules and perform oversight of the market monitor as necessary.  The market monitor shall operate under the supervision and oversight of the commission.  The commission shall retain all enforcement authority conferred under this title, and this section may not be construed to confer enforcement authority on the market monitor or to authorize the commission to delegate the commission's enforcement authority to the market monitor.  The commission by rule shall define:
    
    (1)  the market monitor's monitoring responsibilities, including reporting obligations and limitations;
    
    (2)  the standards for funding the market monitor, including staffing requirements;

Rules governing ethical standards must include provisions designed to ensure that the personnel of the market monitor are professionally and financially independent from market participants.  The commission shall develop and implement policies that clearly separate the policymaking responsibilities of the commission and the monitoring, analysis, and reporting responsibilities of the market monitor.

    Sec. 39.152.  QUALIFYING POWER REGIONS.  (a)  The commission shall certify a power region if:
    
    (1)  a sufficient number of interconnected utilities in the power region fall under the operational control of an independent organization as described by Section [39.151](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.151);
    
    (2)  the power region has a generally applicable tariff that guarantees open and nondiscriminatory access for all users to transmission and distribution facilities in the power region as provided by Section [39.203](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.203);  and
    
    (3)  no person owns and controls more than 20 percent of the installed generation capacity located in or capable of delivering electricity to a power region, as determined according to Section [39.154](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.154).
    
    (b)  In determining whether a power region not entirely within the state meets the requirements of this section, the commission shall consider the extent to which the available transmission facilities limit the delivery of electricity from generators located outside the state to areas of the power region within the state.
    
    (c)  For a power region outside of ERCOT, the requirements of Subsection (a)(2) shall be deemed to have been met if power aggregating to approximately 50,000 megawatts can be delivered to the portion of the power region that is in this state through the payment of not more than one transmission tariff.
    
    (d)  For a power region outside of ERCOT, a power generation company that is affiliated with an electric utility may elect to demonstrate that it meets the requirements of Subsection (a)(3) by showing that it does not own and control more than 20 percent of the installed capacity in a geographic market that includes the power region, using the guidelines, standards, and methods adopted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
    
    (e)  In a power region outside of ERCOT, if customer choice is introduced before the requirements of Subsection (a) are met, an affiliated retail electric provider may not compete for retail customers in any area of the power region that is within this state and outside of the affiliated transmission and distribution utility's certificated service area unless the affiliated power generation company makes a commitment to maintain and does maintain rates that are based on cost of service for any electric cooperative or municipally owned utility that was a wholesale customer on January 1, 1999, and was purchasing power at rates that were based on cost of service.  This subsection requires a power generation company to sell power at rates that are based on cost of service, notwithstanding the expiration of a contract for that service, until the requirements of Subsection (a) are met.

    Sec. 39.153.  CAPACITY AUCTION.  (a)  Each electric utility subject to this section shall sell at auction, at least 60 days before the date set for customer choice to begin, entitlements to at least 15 percent of the electric utility's Texas jurisdictional installed generation capacity.  For the purposes of this section, the term "electric utility" includes any affiliated power generation company that is unbundled from the electric utility in accordance with Section [39.051](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.051), but does not include any entity owning less than 400 megawatts of installed generation capacity.
    
    (b)  The obligation to auction the entitlements shall continue until the earlier of 60 months after the date customer choice is introduced or the date the commission determines that 40 percent or more of the electric power consumed by residential and small commercial customers within the affiliated transmission and distribution utility's certificated service area before the onset of customer choice is provided by nonaffiliated retail electric providers.
    
    (c)  An affiliate of the electric utility selling entitlements in the auction required by this section may not purchase entitlements from the affiliated electric utility at the auction.  Entitlements may only be purchased by entities lawfully able to sell electricity in Texas.
    
    (d)  An electric utility may choose to auction additional entitlements beyond those required by Subsection (a) or continue to auction entitlements after the period required by Subsection (b) in order to comply with Section [39.154](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.154).
    
    (e)  The commission shall adopt rules by December 31, 2000, that define the scope of the capacity entitlements to be auctioned.  Entitlements may be auctioned in blocks of less than 15 percent.  The rules shall state the minimum amount of capacity that can be sold at auction as an entitlement.  At a minimum, the rules shall provide that the entitlements:
    
    (1)  may be sold and purchased in periods of not less than one month nor more than four years;
    
    (2)  may be resold to any lawful purchaser, except for a retail electric provider affiliated with the electric utility that originally auctioned the entitlement;
    
    (3)  include no possessory interest in the unit from which the power is produced;
    
    (4)  include no obligations of a possessory owner of an interest in the unit from which the power is produced;  and
    
    (5)  give the purchaser the right to designate the dispatch of the entitlement, subject to planned outages, outages beyond the control of the utility operating the unit, and other considerations subject to the oversight of the applicable independent organization.
    
    (f)  The commission shall adopt rules by December 31, 2000, that prescribe the procedure for the auction of the entitlements.  The rules shall include:
    
    (1)  a process for conducting the auction or auctions, including who shall conduct it, how often it shall be conducted, and how winning bidders shall be determined;
    
    (2)  a process for the electric utility to designate which generation units or combination of units are offered for auction;
    
    (3)  a provision for the utility to establish an opening bid price based on the electric utility's expected cost, with the commission prescribing the means for determining the opening bid price, which may not include return on equity;  and
    
    (4)  a provision that allows a bidder to specify the magnitude and term of the entitlement, subject to the conditions established in Subsection (e).
    
    (g)  In adopting the process under Subsection (f)(2), the commission shall consider the furtherance of the development of the competitive market, the cost of transmission, physical constraints of the transmission system, the proximity of the generation to load, economic efficiency, and any other factors the commission finds relevant.  The process may provide for commission approval of the designation before auction.  The commission may consult with the applicable independent organization to develop the process.

    Sec. 39.154.  LIMITATION OF OWNERSHIP OF INSTALLED CAPACITY.  (a)  Beginning on the date of introduction of customer choice, a power generation company may not own and control more than 20 percent of the installed generation capacity located in, or capable of delivering electricity to, a power region.
    
    (b)  In a power region not entirely within the state, the commission may waive or modify the requirement in Subsection (a) on a finding of good cause.
    
    (c)  In determining the percentage shares of installed generation capacity under this section, the commission shall combine capacity owned and controlled by a power generation company and any entity that is affiliated with that power generation company within the power region, reduced by the installed generation capacity of those facilities that are made subject to capacity auctions under Sections [39.153](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.153)(a) and (d).
    
    (d)  In this chapter, "installed generation capacity" means all potentially marketable electric generation capacity, including the capacity of:
    
    (1)  generating facilities that are connected with a transmission or distribution system;
    
    (2)  generating facilities used to generate electricity for consumption by the person owning or controlling the facility;  and
    
    (3)  generating facilities that will be connected with a transmission or distribution system and operating within 12 months.
    
    (e)  In determining the percentage shares of installed generation capacity owned and controlled by a power generation company under this section and Section [39.156](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.156), the commission shall, for purposes of calculating the numerator, reduce the installed generation capacity owned and controlled by that power generation company by the installed generation capacity of any "grandfathered facility" within an ozone nonattainment area as of September 1, 1999, for which that power generation company has commenced complying or made a binding commitment to comply with Section [39.264](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.264).  This subsection applies only to a power generation company that is affiliated with an electric utility that owned and controlled more than 27 percent of the installed generation capacity in the power region on January 1, 1999.

    Sec. 39.156.  MARKET POWER MITIGATION PLAN.  (a)  In this section, "market power mitigation plan" or "plan" means a written proposal by an electric utility or a power generation company for reducing its ownership and control of installed generation capacity as required by Section [39.154](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.154).
    
    (b)  An electric utility or power generation company owning and controlling more than 20 percent of the generation capacity located in, or capable of delivering electricity to, a power region shall file a market power mitigation plan with the commission not later than December 1, 2000.
    
    (c)  The plan may provide for:
    
    (1)  the sale of generation assets to a nonaffiliated person;
    
    (2)  the exchange of generation assets with a nonaffiliated person located in a different power region;
    
    (3)  the auctioning of generation capacity entitlements as part of a capacity auction required by Section [39.153](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.153);
    
    (4)  the sale of the right to capacity to a nonaffiliated person for at least four years;  or
    
    (5)  any reasonable method of mitigation.
    
    (d)  For the purposes of this section, generation capacity shall be net of the generation capacity subject to an auction under Section [39.153](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.153).
    
    (e)  The plan shall be in a form prescribed by the commission and shall provide information the commission finds reasonably necessary to evaluate the plan.
    
    (f)  The commission shall approve, modify, or reject a plan within 180 days after the date of a filing under Subsection (b).  The commission may not modify a plan to require divestiture by the electric utility or the power generation company.
    
    (g)  In reaching its determination under Subsection (f), the commission shall consider:
    
    (1)  the degree to which the electric utility's or power generation company's stranded costs, if any, are minimized;
    
    (2)  whether on disposition of the generation assets the reasonable value is likely to be received;
    
    (3)  the effect of the plan on the electric utility's or power generation company's federal income taxes;
    
    (4)  the effect of the plan on current and potential competitors in the generation market;  and
    
    (5)  whether the plan is consistent with the public interest.
    
    (h)  An electric utility or power generation company with an approved mitigation plan may request to amend or repeal its plan.  On a showing of good cause, the commission shall modify or repeal an electric utility's or power generation company's mitigation plan.
    
    (i)  If an electric utility's or a power generation company's market power mitigation plan is not approved before January 1 of the year it is to take effect, the commission may order the electric utility or power generation company to auction generation capacity entitlements according to Section [39.153](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.153), subject to commission approval, of any capacity exceeding the maximum allowable capacity prescribed by Section [39.154](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.154) until the time a mitigation plan is approved.

    Sec. 39.157.  COMMISSION AUTHORITY TO ADDRESS MARKET POWER.  (a)  The commission shall monitor market power associated with the generation, transmission, distribution, and sale of electricity in this state.  On a finding that market power abuses or other violations of this section are occurring, the commission shall require reasonable mitigation of the market power by ordering the construction of additional transmission or distribution facilities, by seeking an injunction or civil penalties as necessary to eliminate or to remedy the market power abuse or violation as authorized by Chapter [15](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=15), by imposing an administrative penalty as authorized by Chapter [15](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=15), by ordering the disgorgement of excess revenue as authorized by Chapter [15](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=15), or by suspending, revoking, or amending a certificate or registration as authorized by Section [39.356](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.356).  Section [15.024](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=15.024)(c) does not apply to an administrative penalty imposed under this section.  For purposes of this subchapter, market power abuses are practices by persons possessing market power that are unreasonably discriminatory or tend to unreasonably restrict, impair, or reduce the level of competition, including practices that tie unregulated products or services to regulated products or services or unreasonably discriminate in the provision of regulated services.  For purposes of this section, "market power abuses" include predatory pricing, withholding of production, precluding entry, and collusion.  A violation of the code of conduct provided by Subsection (d) that materially impairs the ability of a person to compete in a competitive market shall be deemed to be an abuse of market power.  The possession of a high market share in a market open to competition may not, of itself, be deemed to be an abuse of market power;  however, this sentence shall not affect the application of state and federal antitrust laws.
    
    (b)  Beginning on the date of introduction of customer choice, a person that owns generation facilities may not own transmission or distribution facilities in this state except for those facilities necessary to interconnect a generation facility with the transmission or distribution network, a facility not dedicated to public use, or a facility otherwise excluded from the definition of "electric utility" under Section [31.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=31.002).  However, nothing in this chapter shall prohibit a power generation company affiliated with a transmission and distribution utility from owning generation facilities.
    
    (c)  The commission shall monitor market shares of installed capacity to ensure that the limitations in Section [39.154](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.154) are not exceeded.  If the commission finds that a person has violated a limitation in Section [39.154](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.154), the commission shall order the person to file, within 60 days of the date of the order, a market power mitigation plan consistent with the requirements in Section [39.156](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.156).
    
    (d)  Not later than January 10, 2000, the commission shall adopt rules and enforcement procedures to govern transactions or activities between a transmission and distribution utility and its competitive affiliates to avoid potential market power abuses and cross-subsidizations between regulated and competitive activities both during the transition to and after the introduction of competition.  Nothing in this subsection is intended to affect or modify the obligations or duties relating to any rules or standards of conduct that may apply to a utility or the utility's affiliates under orders or regulations of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the Securities and Exchange Commission.  A utility that is subject to statutes or regulations in other states that conflict with a provision of this section may petition the commission for a waiver of the conflicting provision on a showing of good cause.  The rules adopted under this section shall ensure that:
    
    (1)  a utility makes any products and services, other than corporate support services, that it provides to a competitive affiliate available, contemporaneously and in the same manner, to the competitive affiliate's competitors and applies its tariffs, prices, terms, conditions, and discounts for those products and services in the same manner to all similarly situated entities;
    
    (2)  a utility does not:
    
    (A)  give a competitive affiliate or a competitive affiliate's customers any preferential advantage, access, or treatment regarding services other than corporate support services;  or
    
    (B)  act in a manner that is discriminatory or anticompetitive with respect to a nonaffiliated competitor of a competitive affiliate;
    
    (3)  a utility providing electric transmission or distribution services:
    
    (A)  provides those services on nondiscriminatory terms and conditions;
    
    (B)  does not establish as a condition for the provision of those services the purchase of other goods or services from the utility or the competitive affiliate;  and
    
    (C)  does not provide competitive affiliates preferential access to the utility's transmission and distribution systems or to information about those systems;
    
    (4)  a utility does not release any proprietary customer information to a competitive affiliate or any other entity, other than an independent organization as defined by Section [39.151](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.151) or a provider of corporate support services for the purposes of providing the services, without obtaining prior verifiable authorization, as determined from the commission, from the customer;
    
    (5)  a utility does not:
    
    (A)  communicate with a current or potential customer about products or services offered by a competitive affiliate in a manner that favors a competitive affiliate;  or
    
    (B)  allow a competitive affiliate, before September 1, 2005, to use the utility's corporate name, trademark, brand, or logo unless the competitive affiliate includes on employee business cards and in its advertisements of specific services to existing or potential residential or small commercial customers locating within the utility's certificated service area a disclaimer that states, "(Name of competitive affiliate) is not the same company as (name of utility) and is not regulated by the Public Utility Commission of Texas, and you do not have to buy (name of competitive affiliate)'s products to continue to receive quality regulated services from (name of utility).";
    
    (6)  a utility does not conduct joint advertising or promotional activities with a competitive affiliate in a manner that favors the competitive affiliate;
    
    (7)  a utility is a separate, independent entity from any competitive affiliates and, except as provided by Subdivisions (8) and (9), does not share employees, facilities, information, or other resources, other than permissible corporate support services, with those competitive affiliates unless the utility can prove to the commission that the sharing will not compromise the public interest;
    
    (8)  a utility's office space is physically separated from the office space of the utility's competitive affiliates by being located in separate buildings or, if within the same building, by a method such as having the offices on separate floors or with separate access, unless otherwise approved by the commission;
    
    (9)  a utility and a competitive affiliate:
    
    (A)  may, to the extent the utility implements adequate safeguards precluding employees of a competitive affiliate from gaining access to information in a manner inconsistent with Subsection (g) or (i), share common officers and directors, property, equipment, offices to the extent consistent with Subdivision (8), credit, investment, or financing arrangements to the extent consistent with Subdivision (17), computer systems, information systems, and corporate support services;  and
    
    (B)  are not required to enter into prior written contracts or competitive solicitations for non-tariffed transactions between the utility and the competitive affiliate, except that the commission by rule may require the utility and the competitive affiliate to enter into prior written contracts or competitive solicitations for certain classes of transactions, other than corporate support services, that have a per unit value of more than $75,000 or that total more than $1 million;
    
    (10)  a utility does not temporarily assign, for less than one year, employees engaged in transmission or distribution system operations to a competitive affiliate unless the employee does not have knowledge of information that is intended to be protected under this section;
    
    (11)  a utility does not subsidize the business activities of an affiliate with revenues from a regulated service;
    
    (12)  a utility and its affiliates fully allocate costs for any shared services, corporate support services, and other items described by Subdivisions (8) and (9);
    
    (13)  a utility and its affiliates keep separate books of accounts and records and the commission may review records relating to a transaction between a utility and an affiliate;
    
    (14)  assets transferred or services provided between a utility and an affiliate, other than transfers that facilitate unbundling under Section [39.051](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.051) or asset valuation under Section [39.262](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.262), are priced at a level that is fair and reasonable to the customers of the utility and reflects the market value of the assets or services or the utility's fully allocated cost to provide those assets or services;
    
    (15)  regulated services that a utility provides on a routine or recurring basis are included in a tariff that is subject to commission approval;

    SUBCHAPTER E. PRICE REGULATION AFTER COMPETITION
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 39.201.  COST OF SERVICE TARIFFS AND CHARGES.  (a)  Each electric utility shall, on or before April 1, 2000, file proposed tariffs for its proposed transmission and distribution utility.
    
    (b)  The filing under this section shall include supporting cost data for determination of nonbypassable delivery charges, which shall be the sum of:
    
    (1)  transmission and distribution utility charges by customer class based on a forecasted 2002 test year;
    
    (2)  a system benefit fund fee;  and
    
    (3)  an expected competition transition charge, if any.
    
    (c)  Each electric utility shall also identify the unbundled generation and retail energy service costs by customer class.
    
    (d)  In accordance with a schedule and procedures it establishes, the commission shall hold a hearing and approve or modify and make effective as of January 1, 2002, the transmission and distribution utility's proposed tariffs for transmission and distribution services, the system benefit fund fee, and the expected competition transition charge as determined under Subsections (g) and (h) and as implemented under Subsections (i)-(l), if any.
    
    (e)  The system benefit fund fee shall be that established by the commission under Section [39.903](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.903).
    
    (f)  The expected competition transition charge shall be that as determined under Subsections (g) and (h) and as implemented under Subsections (i)-(l).
    
    (g)  The expected competition transition charge approved by the commission shall be calculated from the amount of stranded costs as defined in Subchapter F that are reasonably projected to exist on the last day of the freeze period modified to reflect any adjustments determined appropriate by the commission under Section [39.261](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.261)(c).
    
    (h)  The electric utility shall use the ECOM administrative model referenced in Section [39.262](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.262) to determine estimated stranded costs.  The model must include updated company-specific inputs.  Natural gas prices used in the model must be market-based natural gas forward prices, where available.  Growth rates in generating plant operations and maintenance costs and allocated administrative and general costs shall be benchmarked by comparing those costs to the best available information on cost trends for comparable generating plants.  Capital additions shall be benchmarked using the limitation in Section [39.259](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.259)(b).
    
    (i)  An electric utility may:
    
    (1)  at any time after the start of the freeze period, securitize 100 percent of its regulatory assets as defined by Section [39.302](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.302) and up to 75 percent of its estimated stranded costs as defined by this section and recover those charges through a transition charge, in accordance with a financing order issued by the commission under Section [39.303](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.303);
    
    (2)  implement, under bond, a nonbypassable charge of up to 100 percent of its estimated stranded costs;  or
    
    (3)  use a combination of the two methods under Subdivisions (1) and (2).
    
    (j)  Any competition transition charge shall be allocated among retail customer classes according to Section [39.253](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.253).
    
    (k)  In determining the length of time over which stranded costs under Subsection (h) may be recovered, the commission shall consider:
    
    (1)  the electric utility's rates as of the end of the freeze period;
    
    (2)  the sum of the transmission and distribution charges and the system benefit fund fees;
    
    (3)  the proportion of estimated stranded costs to the invested capital of the electric utility;  and
    
    (4)  any other factor consistent with the public interest as expressed in this chapter.
    
    (l)  Two years after customer choice is introduced, the stranded cost estimate under this section shall be reviewed and, if necessary, adjusted to reflect a final, actual valuation in the true-up proceeding under Section [39.262](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.262).  If, based on that proceeding, the competition transition charge is not sufficient, the commission may extend the collection period for the charge or, if necessary, increase the charge.  Alternatively, if it is found in the true-up proceeding that the competition transition charge is larger than is needed to recover any remaining stranded costs, the commission may:
    
    (1)  reduce the competition transition charge, to the extent it has not been securitized;
    
    (2)  reverse, in whole or in part, the depreciation expense that has been redirected under Section [39.256](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.256);

    Sec. 39.202.  PRICE TO BEAT.  (a)  From January 1, 2002, until January 1, 2007, an affiliated retail electric provider shall make available to residential and small commercial customers of its affiliated transmission and distribution utility rates that, on a bundled basis, are six percent less than the affiliated electric utility's corresponding average residential and small commercial rates, on a bundled basis, that were in effect on January 1, 1999, adjusted to reflect the fuel factor determined as provided by Subsection (b) and adjusted for any base rate reduction as stipulated to by an electric utility in a proceeding for which a final order had not been issued by January 1, 1999.  These rates on a bundled basis shall be known as the "price to beat" for residential and small commercial customers, except that the "price to beat" for a utility is the rate in effect as a result of a settlement approved by the commission after January 1, 1999, if the commission determines that base rates for that utility have been reduced by more than 12 percent as a result of a final order issued by the commission after October 1, 1998.
    
    (b)  The commission shall determine the fuel factor for each electric utility as of December 31, 2001.
    
    (c)  After the date of customer choice, each affiliated power generation company shall file a final fuel reconciliation for the period ending the day before the date customer choice is introduced.  The final fuel balance from that reconciliation shall be included in the true-up proceeding under Section [39.262](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.262).
    
    (d)  An affiliated retail electric provider shall make public its price to beat in a manner that provides adequate disclosure as determined by the commission.
    
    (e)  The affiliated retail electric provider may not charge rates for residential or small commercial customers that are different from the price to beat until the earlier of 36 months after the date customer choice is introduced or:
    
    (1)  for service to residential customers, the date the commission determines that 40 percent or more of the electric power consumed by residential customers within the affiliated transmission and distribution utility's certificated service area before the onset of customer choice is committed to be served by nonaffiliated retail electric providers;  or
    
    (2)  for service to small commercial customers, the date the commission determines that 40 percent or more of the electric power consumed by small commercial customers within the affiliated transmission and distribution utility's certificated service area before the onset of customer choice is committed to be served by nonaffiliated retail electric providers.
    
    (f)  Notwithstanding Subsection (e), the affiliated retail electric provider may charge rates that are different from the price to beat for service to aggregated loads of nonresidential customers having an aggregated peak demand greater than 1,000 kilowatts, provided that all affected customers are:
    
    (1)  commonly owned;  or
    
    (2)  franchisees of the same franchisor.
    
    (g)  The affiliated retail electric provider may not encourage or provide an incentive to a customer to switch to a nonaffiliated retail electric provider, promote any nonaffiliated retail electric provider, or exchange customers with any nonaffiliated retail electric provider to comply with the requirements of Subsection (e)(1) or (2).
    
    (h)  The following standards shall be used for measuring electric power consumption during the period before the onset of customer choice:
    
    (1)  the consumption of residential and small commercial customers with an annual peak demand less than or equal to 20 kilowatts shall be based on the average annual consumption of those respective groups during the year 2000;
    
    (2)  consumption for all small commercial customers with an annual peak demand larger than 20 kilowatts shall be based on each customer's usage during the year 2000;  and
    
    (3)  for purposes of determining whether an affiliated retail electric provider has met the requirements of Subsection (e)(2), the aggregated loads of nonresidential customers having a peak demand greater than 1,000 kilowatts that are served by the affiliated retail electric provider at a rate different from the price to beat under Subsection (f) shall be deducted from the electric power consumption of small commercial customers during the period before the onset of customer choice.
    
    (i)  For purposes of Subsection (h)(2), if less than 12 months of consumption history exists for any such customer, the usage history shall be supplemented with the prior history of that customer's location.  For service to a new location, the annual consumption shall be determined as the transmission and distribution utility's estimate of the maximum annual kilowatt demand used in sizing the electric service to that customer multiplied by 8,760 hours, and that product multiplied by the average annual customer load factor for small commercial customers with loads greater than 20 kilowatts for the year 2000.
    
    (j)  On determining that its affiliated retail electric provider has met the requirements of Subsection (e)(1) or (2), an electric utility or a transmission and distribution utility shall make a filing with the commission attesting to the fact that those requirements have been met and that the restrictions of Subsection (e)(1) or (2) and the true-up in Section [39.262](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.262)(e) are no longer applicable.  The commission shall adopt appropriate procedures to enable it to accept or reject the filing within 30 days.
    
    (k)  Following the true-up proceedings conducted under Section [39.262](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.262), the commission may adjust the price to beat.
    
    (l)  An affiliated retail electric provider may request that the commission adjust the fuel factor established under Subsection (b) not more than twice a year if the affiliated retail electric provider demonstrates that the existing fuel factor does not adequately reflect significant changes in the market price of natural gas and purchased energy used to serve retail customers.
    
    (m)  In a power region outside of ERCOT, if customer choice is introduced before the requirements of Section [39.152](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.152)(a) are met, an affiliated retail electric provider shall charge rates to customers other than residential and small commercial customers that are no higher than the rates that, on a bundled basis, were in effect on January 1, 1999, adjusted to reflect the fuel factor as provided by Subsection (b) and adjusted for any base rate reduction as stipulated to by an electric utility in a proceeding for which a final order had not been issued by January 1, 1999.
    
    (n)  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), in a power region outside of ERCOT, if customer choice is introduced before the requirements of Section [39.152](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.152)(a) are met, an affiliated retail electric provider shall continue to offer the price to beat to residential and small commercial customers, unless the price is changed by the commission in accordance with this chapter, until the later of 60 months after the date customer choice is introduced or the requirements of Section [39.152](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.152)(a) are met.
    
    (o)  In this section, "small commercial customer" means a commercial customer having a peak demand of 1,000 kilowatts or less.
    
    (p)  On finding that a retail electric provider will be unable to maintain its financial integrity if it complies with Subsection (a), the commission shall set the retail electric provider's price to beat at the minimum level that will allow the retail electric provider to maintain its financial integrity.  However, in no event shall the price to beat exceed the level of rates, on a bundled basis, charged by the affiliated electric utility on September 1, 1999, adjusted for fuel as provided by Subsection (b).

    Sec. 39.203.  TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION SERVICE.  (a)  All transmission and distribution utilities shall provide transmission service at wholesale under Subchapter [A](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=35.001), Chapter [35](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=35).  In addition, on and after January 1, 2002, a transmission and distribution utility shall provide transmission or distribution service, or both, at retail to an electric utility, a retail electric provider, a municipally owned utility, an electric cooperative, or an end-use customer at rates, terms of access, and conditions that are comparable to those that apply to the transmission and distribution utility and its affiliates.  A municipally owned utility offering customer choice or an electric cooperative offering customer choice shall likewise provide transmission or distribution service, or both, at retail to all such entities in accordance with the commission's rules applicable to terms and conditions of access and at rates adopted in accordance with Sections [40.055](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=40.055)(a)(1) and [41.055](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=41.055)(1), respectively.
    
    (b)  When necessary to serve a wholesale customer an electric utility, an electric cooperative that has not opted for customer choice, or a municipally owned utility that has not opted for customer choice shall provide wholesale transmission service at distribution voltage.  A customer of a municipally owned utility that has not opted for customer choice or of an electric cooperative that has not opted for customer choice may not claim the status of a wholesale customer or be designated as a wholesale customer if the customer is being or has been served under a retail rate schedule of the municipally owned utility or electric cooperative.
    
    (c)  On or before January 1, 2002, the commission shall establish for all retail electric utilities offering customer choice reasonable and comparable terms and conditions, in accordance with Section [39.201](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.201), that comply with Subsection (a) for open access on distribution facilities and shall establish, for all retail electric utilities offering customer choice other than municipally owned utilities and electric cooperatives, reasonable and comparable rates for open access on distribution facilities.
    
    (d)  The terms of access, conditions, and rates established under Subsection (c) shall be comparable to the terms of access, conditions, and rates that the electric utility applies to itself or its affiliates.  The rules shall also provide that all ancillary services provided by the utility to itself or its affiliates are also available to third parties on request on a nondiscriminatory basis.
    
    (e)  The commission may require an electric utility or a transmission and distribution utility to construct or enlarge facilities to ensure safe and reliable service for the state's electric markets and to reduce transmission constraints within ERCOT in a cost-effective manner where the constraints are such that they are not being resolved through Chapter [37](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=37) or the ERCOT transmission planning process.   In any proceeding brought under Chapter [37](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=37), an electric utility or transmission and distribution utility ordered to construct or enlarge facilities under this subchapter need not prove that the construction ordered is necessary for the service, accommodation, convenience, or safety of the public and need not address the factors listed in Sections [37.056](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=37.056)(c)(1)-(3) and (4)(E).  Notwithstanding any other law, including Section [37.057](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=37.057), in any proceeding brought under Chapter [37](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=37) by an electric utility or a transmission and distribution utility related to an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to construct or enlarge transmission or transmission-related facilities under this subsection, the commission shall issue a final order before the 181st day after the date the application is filed with the commission.  If the commission does not issue a final order before that date, the application is approved.
    
    (f)  The commission's rules must be consistent with the standards of this title and may not be contrary to an applicable decision, rule, or policy statement of a federal regulatory agency having jurisdiction.
    
    (g)  Each power region shall have generally applicable tariffs approved by the commission or a federal regulatory agency having jurisdiction that guarantees open and nondiscriminatory access as required by Section [39.152](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.152).  This subsection may not be deemed to vest in the commission power to set or approve distribution access rates of a municipally owned utility or an electric cooperative that has adopted customer choice.
    
    (h)  A customer in a multiply certificated service area may switch its retail distribution service provider among certificated retail electric utilities only by disconnecting from the facilities of one retail electric utility and connecting to the facilities of another retail electric utility.
    
    (i)  The commission, in cooperation with transmission and distribution utilities and the ERCOT independent system operator, shall study whether existing transmission and distribution planning processes are sufficient to provide adequate infrastructure for seawater desalination projects.  If the commission determines that statutory changes are needed to ensure that adequate infrastructure is developed for projects of that kind, the commission shall include recommendations in the report required by Section [12.203](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=12.203).

    Sec. 39.206.  NUCLEAR GENERATING UNIT DECOMMISSIONING COST PLAN.  (a)  For purposes of this section:
    
    (1)  "Decommissioning" includes decommissioning and decontamination of a nuclear generating unit consistent with federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission requirements.
    
    (2)  "Nuclear decommissioning trust" means an external and irrevocable trust created for the purpose of funding decommissioning obligations for a nuclear generating unit, consistent with federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission requirements.
    
    (3)  "Nuclear generating unit" means an electric generating facility that uses nuclear energy to generate electricity for sale and is licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
    
    (4)  "Power generation company" has the meaning assigned by Section [31.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=31.002).
    
    (5)  "Retail electric customer" means a retail electric customer:
    
    (A)  in a geographic area of this state in which retail customer choice has been implemented; or
    
    (B)  of a municipally owned utility or electric cooperative that has an agreement to purchase power from a nuclear generating unit.
    
    (b)  This section applies only to the first six nuclear generating units the construction of which begins on or after January 1, 2013, and before January 1, 2033, and which are owned in whole or in part by a power generation company that elects to utilize the decommissioning mechanism set forth in this section.
    
    (c)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a power generation company to use a commission approved method to provide funds for decommissioning, if the power generation company can otherwise satisfy the decommissioning financial assurance requirements of the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
    
    (d)  A power generation company that owns a nuclear generating unit shall fund out of operating revenues on an annual basis:
    
    (1)  the costs associated with funding the decommissioning obligations for the nuclear generating unit; or
    
    (2)  the power generation company's portion of the decommissioning costs for the nuclear generating unit in proportion to the company's ownership interest in the nuclear generating unit if the unit is owned by more than one person.
    
    (e)  The obligation to fund a nuclear decommissioning trust fund is not dischargeable in bankruptcy.
    
    (f)  A power generation company shall establish a nuclear decommissioning trust for a nuclear generating unit it owns or for the proportionate share of a nuclear generating unit of which it owns a part.  The funding obligations for the trust must begin before the nuclear generating unit commences its initial fuel load and begins commercial operation to generate power for sale.  The terms of the trust must be consistent with trust terms and conditions the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission requires for providing financial assurance for decommissioning.
    
    (g)  The commission by order shall establish for a nuclear generating unit the amount of annual decommissioning funding necessary to meet the decommissioning obligations for the nuclear generating unit over the unit's operating license period as established by the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission or over a shorter period of time at the election of the power generation company.  The power generation company shall perform a study on the cost of decommissioning to establish the decommissioning obligations before the nuclear generating unit begins commercial operation to generate power for sale.  The study shall be performed by the power generation company at least once in each three-year period during the unit's operating license period using the most current reasonably available information on the cost of decommissioning.  The commission shall conduct a proceeding at least once in each three-year period to review the study and other current reasonably available information on the cost of decommissioning and determine the reasonableness of the study.
    
    (h)  A power generation company shall file an annual report to provide the status of the decommissioning trust fund and to update the commission as to its ability to fund the decommissioning trust fund.  In determining the amount of the annual decommissioning funding under this subsection, at least once in each three-year period, the commission shall conduct a proceeding to review the balance of each nuclear decommissioning trust and the projected amount of annual decommissioning funding for the associated nuclear generating unit.  On the conclusion of the review proceeding, the commission by order shall revise the amount of annual funding for the nuclear generating unit in order to ensure that the nuclear decommissioning trust fund is adequately funded.
    
    (i)  A power generation company shall remit the appropriate amount of annual decommissioning funding to the nuclear decommissioning trust created for its proportionate ownership position in a nuclear generating unit in accordance with the commission's funding order issued under Subsection (g) or (h).  The commission shall take appropriate actions to ensure proper funding of the nuclear decommissioning trust, including possibly terminating the power generation company's registration to operate, if the company violates this subsection.
    
    (j)  A power generation company that owns a nuclear generating unit is the funds administrator of the nuclear decommissioning trust for the associated nuclear generating unit.  The company, as funds administrator, shall invest the trust funds in accordance with guidelines established by commission rule and consistent with the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission guidelines so that the decommissioning funds, plus the amounts earned from investment of the funds, will be available at the time of decommissioning.  The commission shall adopt rules to define the company's specific duties as funds administrator and requirements regarding prudent management and investment of nuclear decommissioning trust funds.
    
    (k)  The commission shall adopt rules necessary to ensure that:
    
    (1)  a power generation company remits sufficient funds to a nuclear decommissioning trust on an annual basis, including projected earnings to approximate the amount remaining to be accumulated to cover the cost of decommissioning a nuclear generating unit at the end of its operating license period divided by the remaining  years of the license and in accordance with applicable state and federal laws and regulations or over a shorter period of time at the election of the power generation company;
    
    (2)  the periodic cost studies and reviews described in Subsections (g) and (h) include all current reasonably available information as determined necessary and appropriate by the commission;
    
    (3)  all funds remitted to a nuclear decommissioning trust are prudently managed and spent for their intended purpose;
    
    (4)  the funds remitted to a nuclear decommissioning trust and the amounts earned from investing the funds, will be available for, and restricted to the purpose of decommissioning of the associated nuclear generating unit, including if the trust or nuclear generating unit is transferred to another person; and
    
    (5)  before a power generation company is allowed to take advantage of the mechanisms in this section, the company meets creditworthiness standards established by the commission to minimize the risk that retail electric customers will be responsible for funding any shortfall in the cost of decommissioning a nuclear generating unit.
    
    (l)  In addition to the nuclear decommissioning trust required by Subsection (f), for purposes of Subsection (k), the power generation company and its parent and affiliates shall provide financial assurances that funds will be available to satisfy up to 16 years of annual decommissioning funding in the event the power generation company defaults on its obligation to make annual funding to the decommissioning trust.  Within 180 days after the effective date of this section, the commission by rule shall establish the acceptable forms of financial assurance, which shall include, but not be limited to, parent guarantees and support agreements, letters of credit, surety or insurance, and such other requirements necessary to ensure compliance with this section.  In establishing the acceptable forms of assurance, and the eligibility requirements for each form of assurance, the commission shall consider the relative risk factors and creditworthiness attributes of potential applicant financial characteristics in order to minimize exposure of retail electric customers to default by power generation companies under this section.  The power generation company may choose the manner of financial assurance for which it is eligible under the commission's rules.
    
    (m)  In the event the financial assurances provided by Subsection (k) are insufficient to meet the annual funding requirements of the decommissioning trust, the retail electric customers shall be responsible for funding any shortfall in the cost of decommissioning the nuclear generating unit.
    
    (n)  The commission shall determine the manner in which any shortfall in the cost of decommissioning a nuclear generating unit shall be recovered from retail electric customers in the state, consistent with law.
    
    (o)  For retail electric customers of a municipally owned utility or an electric cooperative that has an agreement to purchase power from a nuclear generating unit, the amount of the shortfall in the cost of decommissioning the nuclear generating unit that the customers are responsible for is limited to a portion of that shortfall that bears the same proportion to the total shortfall as the amount of electric power generated by the nuclear generating unit and purchased by the municipally owned utility or electric cooperative bears to the total amount of power the nuclear generating unit generated.
    
    (p)  If retail electric customers in this state become responsible for the costs of decommissioning a nuclear generating unit and incur costs under this section and the nuclear generating unit is operational, as a condition of operating the generating unit, the power generation company or any new owner shall repay the costs the electric customers incurred in the manner determined by the commission.  The commission may authorize the repayment to occur over a period established by the commission.
    
    (q)  The commission shall, in conjunction with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, investigate the development of a mechanism whereby the State of Texas could ensure that funds for decommissioning will be obtained when necessary in the same manner as if the State of Texas were the licensee under federal law. 
    
    (r)  The commission by rule shall ensure that:
    
    (1)  money for decommissioning a nuclear generating unit is prudently collected, managed, and spent for its intended purposes; and
    
    (2)  decommissioning money that remains unspent after decommissioning of the nuclear generating unit is complete is returned to the power generation company and the retail electric customers based on the proportionate amount of money the power generation company and retail electric customers paid into the fund.

    (6)  "Retail stranded costs" means that part of net stranded cost associated with the provision of retail service.
    
    (7)  "Stranded cost" means the positive excess of the net book value of generation assets over the market value of the assets, taking into account all of the electric utility's generation assets, any above market purchased power costs, and any deferred debit related to a utility's discontinuance of the application of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71 ("Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation") for generation-related assets if required by the provisions of this chapter.  For purposes of Section [39.262](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.262), book value shall be established as of December 31, 2001, or the date a market value is established through a market valuation method under Section [39.262](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.262)(h), whichever is earlier, and shall include stranded costs incurred under Section [39.263](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.263).

    Sec. 39.252.  RIGHT TO RECOVER STRANDED COSTS.  (a)  An electric utility is allowed to recover all of its net, verifiable, nonmitigable stranded costs incurred in purchasing power and providing electric generation service.
    
    (b)(1) Recovery of retail stranded costs by an electric utility shall be from all existing or future retail customers, including the facilities, premises, and loads of those retail customers, within the utility's geographical certificated service area as it existed on May 1, 1999.  A retail customer may not avoid stranded cost recovery charges by switching to new on-site generation except as provided by Section [39.262](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.262)(k).  For purposes of this subchapter, "new on-site generation" means electric generation capacity greater than 10 megawatts capable of being lawfully delivered to the site without use of utility distribution or transmission facilities and which was not, on or before December 31, 1999, either:
    
    (A)  a fully operational facility;  or
    
    (B)  a project supported by substantially complete filings for all necessary site-specific environmental permits under the rules of the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission in effect at the time of filing.
    
    (2)  If a customer commences taking energy from new on-site generation which materially reduces the customer's use of energy delivered through the utility's facilities, the customer shall pay an amount each month computed by multiplying the output of the on-site generation by the new sum of competition transition charges under Section [39.201](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.201) and transition charges under Subchapter G which are in effect during that month.  Payment shall be made to the utility, its successors, an assignee, or other collection agent responsible for collecting the competition transition charges and transition charges and shall be collected in addition to the competition transition charges and transition charges applicable to energy actually delivered to the customer through the utility's facilities.
    
    (c)  In multiply certificated areas, a retail customer may not avoid stranded cost recovery charges by switching to another electric utility, electric cooperative, or municipally owned utility after May 1, 1999.  A customer in a multiply certificated service area that requested to switch providers on or before May 1, 1999, or was not taking service from an electric utility on May 1, 1999, and does not do so after that date is not responsible for paying retail stranded costs of that utility.
    
    (d)  An electric utility shall pursue commercially reasonable means to reduce its potential stranded costs, including good faith attempts to renegotiate above-cost fuel and purchased power contracts or the exercise of normal business practices to protect the value of its assets.  The commission shall consider the utility's efforts under this subsection when determining the amount of the utility's stranded costs;  provided, however, that nothing in this section authorizes the commission to substitute its judgment for a market valuation of generation assets determined under Sections [39.262](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.262)(h) and (i).

    Sec. 39.253.  ALLOCATION OF STRANDED COSTS.  (a)  Any capital costs incurred by an electric utility to improve air quality under Section [39.263](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.263) or [39.264](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.264) that are included in a utility's invested capital in accordance with those sections shall be allocated among customer classes as follows:
    
    (1)  50 percent of those costs shall be allocated in accordance with the methodology used to allocate the costs of the underlying assets in the electric utility's most recent commission order addressing rate design;  and
    
    (2)  the remainder shall be allocated on the basis of the energy consumption of the customer classes.
    
    (b)  All other retail stranded costs shall be allocated among retail customer classes in accordance with Subsections (c)-(i).
    
    (c)  The allocation to the residential class shall be determined by allocating to all customer classes 50 percent of the stranded costs in accordance with the methodology used to allocate the costs of the underlying assets in the electric utility's most recent commission order addressing rate design and allocating the remainder of the stranded costs on the basis of the energy consumption of the classes.
    
    (d)  After the allocation to the residential class required by Subsection (c) has been calculated, the remaining stranded costs shall be allocated to the remaining customer classes in accordance with the methodology used to allocate the costs of the underlying assets in the electric utility's most recent commission order addressing rate design.  Non-firm industrial customers shall be allocated stranded costs equal to 150 percent of the amount allocated to that class.
    
    (e)  After the allocation to the residential class required by Subsection (c) and the allocation to the nonfirm industrial class required by Subsection (d) have been calculated, the remaining stranded costs shall be allocated to the remaining customer classes in accordance with the methodology used to allocate the costs of the underlying assets in the electric utility's most recent commission order addressing rate design.
    
    (f)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, to the extent that the total retail stranded costs, including regulatory assets, of investor-owned utilities exceed $5 billion on a statewide basis, any stranded costs in excess of $5 billion shall be allocated among retail customer classes in accordance with the methodology used to allocate the costs of the underlying assets in the electric utility's most recent commission order addressing rate design.
    
    (g)  The energy consumption of the customer classes used in Subsections (a)(2) and (c) shall be based on the relevant class characteristics as of May 1, 1999, adjusted for normal weather conditions.
    
    (h)  For purposes of this section, "stranded costs" includes regulatory assets.
    
    (i)  Except as provided by Section [39.262](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.262)(k), no customer or customer class may avoid the obligation to pay the amount of stranded costs allocated to that customer class.

    Sec. 39.254.  USE OF REVENUES FOR UTILITIES WITH STRANDED COSTS.  This subchapter provides a number of tools to an electric utility to mitigate stranded costs.  Each electric utility that was reported by the commission to have positive "excess costs over market" (ECOM), denoted as the "base case" for the amount of stranded costs before full retail competition in 2002 with respect to its Texas jurisdiction, in the April 1998 Report to the Texas Senate Interim Committee on Electric Utility Restructuring entitled "Potentially Strandable Investment (ECOM) Report:  1998 Update," must use these tools to reduce the net book value of, otherwise referred to as "accelerate" the cost recovery of, its stranded costs each year.  Any positive difference under the report required by Section [39.257](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.257)(b) shall be applied to the net book value of generation assets.

    Sec. 39.255.  USE OF REVENUES FOR UTILITIES WITH NO STRANDED COSTS.  (a)  An electric utility that does not have stranded costs described by Section [39.254](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.254) shall be permitted to use any positive difference under the report required by Section [39.257](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.257)(b) on capital expenditures to improve or expand transmission or distribution facilities, or on capital expenditures to improve air quality, as approved by the commission.  Any such capital expenditures shall be made in the calendar year immediately following the year for which the report required by Section [39.257](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.257) is calculated.  The capital expenditures shall be reflected in any future proceeding under this chapter to set transmission or distribution rates as a reduction to the utility's transmission and distribution invested capital, as approved by the commission.
    
    (b)  To the extent that positive differences under the report required by Section [39.257](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.257)(b) are not used for capital expenditures, the amounts shall be flowed back to the electric utility's Texas jurisdictional customers through the power cost recovery factor.
    
    (c)  This section applies only to the use of positive differences under the report required by Section [39.257](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.257)(b) for each year during the freeze period.

    (b)  The electric utility shall report a decision under Subsection (a) to the commission and any other applicable regulatory authority.
    
    (c)  Any adjustments made to the book value of transmission and distribution assets or the creation of any related regulatory assets resulting from the redirection under this section shall be accepted and applied by the commission for establishing net invested capital and transmission and distribution rates for retail customers in all future proceedings.
    
    (d)  Notwithstanding Subsection (c), the design of post-freeze-period retail rates may not:
    
    (1)  shift the allocation of responsibility for stranded costs;
    
    (2)  include the adjusted costs in wholesale transmission and distribution rates;  or
    
    (3)  apply the adjustments for the purpose of establishing net invested capital and transmission and distribution rates for wholesale customers.

    Sec. 39.262.  TRUE-UP PROCEEDING.  (a)  An electric utility, together with its affiliated retail electric provider and its affiliated transmission and distribution utility, may not be permitted to overrecover stranded costs through the procedures established by this section or through the application of the measures provided by the other sections of this chapter.
    
    (b)  After the freeze period, an electric utility located in a power region that is not certified under Section [39.152](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.152) shall continue to file annual reports under Sections [39.257](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.257), [39.258](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.258), and [39.259](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.259) as if the freeze period remained in effect, until the time the power region qualifies as certified under Section [39.152](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.152).  In addition, the commission staff and the office shall continue to review the annual reports as provided by Section [39.261](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.261).
    
    (c)  After January 10, 2004, at a schedule and under procedures to be determined by the commission, each transmission and distribution utility, its affiliated retail electric provider, and its affiliated power generation company shall jointly file to finalize stranded costs under Subsections (h) and (i) and reconcile those costs with the estimated stranded costs used to develop the competition transition charge in the proceeding held under Section [39.201](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.201).  Any resulting difference shall be applied to the nonbypassable delivery rates of the transmission and distribution utility, except that at the utility's option, any or all of the amounts recovered under this section may be securitized under Subchapter G.
    
    (d)  The affiliated power generation company shall reconcile, and either credit or bill to the transmission and distribution utility, the net sum of:
    
    (1)  the former electric utility's final fuel balance determined under Section [39.202](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.202)(c);  and
    
    (2)  any difference between the price of power obtained through the capacity auctions under Sections [39.153](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.153) and [39.156](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.156) and the power cost projections that were employed for the same time period in the ECOM model to estimate stranded costs in the proceeding under Section [39.201](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.201).
    
    (e)  To the extent that the price to beat exceeded the market price of electricity, the affiliated retail electric provider shall reconcile and credit to the affiliated transmission and distribution utility any positive difference between the price to beat established under Section [39.202](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.202), reduced by the nonbypassable delivery charge established under Section [39.201](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.201), and the prevailing market price of electricity during the same time period.  A reconciliation for the applicable customer class is not required under this subsection for an affiliated retail electric provider that satisfies the requirements of Section [39.202](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.202)(e)(1) or (2) before the expiration of two years from the introduction of customer choice.  If a reconciliation is required, in no event shall the amount credited exceed an amount equal to the number of residential or small commercial customers served by the affiliated transmission and distribution utility that are buying electricity from the affiliated retail electric provider at the price to beat on the second anniversary of the beginning of competition, minus the number of new customers obtained outside the service area, multiplied by $150.
    
    (f)  To the extent that any amount of regulatory assets included in a transition charge or competition transition charge exceeds the amount of regulatory assets approved in a rate order which became effective on or before September 1, 1999, the commission shall conduct a review during the true-up proceeding to determine whether such amounts were appropriately calculated and constituted reasonable and necessary costs pursuant to Subchapter [B](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=36.051), Chapter [36](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=36).  If the commission finds that the amount of regulatory assets specified in Section [39.302](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.302)(5) is subject to modification, a credit or other rate adjustment shall be made to the transmission and distribution utility's nonbypassable delivery rates;  provided, however, that no adjustment may be made to a transition charge established under Subchapter G.
    
    (g)  Based on the credits or bills received from its affiliates under Subsections (d), (e), and (f), the transmission and distribution utility shall make necessary adjustments to the nonbypassable delivery rates it charges to retail electric providers.  If the commission determines that the nonbypassable delivery rates are not sufficient, the commission may extend the original collection period for the charge or, if necessary, increase the charge.  Alternatively, if the commission determines that the nonbypassable delivery rates are larger than are needed to recover the transmission and distribution utility's costs, the commission shall correspondingly reduce:
    
    (1)  the competition transition charge, to the extent it has not been securitized;
    
    (2)  the depreciation expense that has been redirected under Section [39.256](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.256);
    
    (3)  the transmission and distribution utility's rates;  or
    
    (4)  a combination of the elements in Subdivisions (1)-(3).
    
    (h)  Except as provided in Subsection (i), for the purpose of finalizing the stranded cost estimate used to establish the competition transition charge under Section [39.201](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.201), the affiliated power generation company shall quantify its stranded costs using one or more of the following methods:
    
    (1)  Sale of Assets.  If, at any time after December 31, 1999, an electric utility or its affiliated power generation company has sold some or all of its generation assets, which sale shall include all generating assets associated with each generating plant that is sold, in a bona fide third-party transaction under a competitive offering, the total net value realized from the sale establishes the market value of the generation assets sold.  If not all assets are sold, the market value of the remaining generation assets shall be established by one or more of the other methods in this section.
    
    (2)  Stock Valuation Method.  If, at any time after December 31, 1999, an electric utility or its affiliated power generation company has transferred some or all of its generation assets, including, at the election of the electric utility or power generation company, any fuel and fuel transportation contracts related to those assets, to one or more separate affiliated or nonaffiliated corporations, not less than 51 percent of the common stock of each corporation is spun off and sold to public investors through a national stock exchange, and the common stock has been traded for not less than one year, the resulting average daily closing price of the common stock over 30 consecutive trading days chosen by the commission out of the last 120 consecutive trading days before the filing required under Subsection (c) establishes the market value of the common stock equity in each transferee corporation.  The book value of each transferee corporation's debt and preferred stock securities shall be added to the market value of its assets.  The market value of each transferee corporation's assets shall be reduced by the corresponding net book value of the assets acquired by each transferee corporation from any entity other than the affiliated electric utility or power generation company.  The resulting market value of the assets establishes the market value of the generation assets transferred by the electric utility or power generation company to each separate corporation.  If not all assets are disposed of in this manner, the market value of the remaining assets shall be established by one or more of the other methods in this section.
    
    (3)  Partial Stock Valuation Method.  If, at any time after December 31, 1999, an electric utility or its affiliated power generation company has transferred some or all of its generation assets, including, at the election of the electric utility or power generation company, any fuel and fuel transportation contracts related to those assets, to one or more separate affiliated or nonaffiliated corporations, at least 19 percent, but less than 51 percent, of the common stock of each corporation is spun off and sold to public investors through a national stock exchange, and the common stock has been traded for not less than one year, the resulting average daily closing price of the common stock over 30 consecutive trading days chosen by the commission out of the last 120 consecutive trading days before the filing required under Subsection (c) shall be presumed to establish the market value of the common stock equity in each transferee corporation.  The commission may accept the market valuation to conclusively establish the value of the common stock equity in each transferee corporation or convene a valuation panel of three independent financial experts to determine whether the percentage of common stock sold is fairly representative of the total common stock equity or whether a control premium exists for the retained interest.  The valuation panel must consist of financial experts, chosen from proposals submitted in response to commission requests, from the top 10 nationally recognized investment banks with demonstrated experience in the United States electric industry as indicated by the dollar amount of public offerings of long-term debt and equity of United States investor-owned electric companies over the immediately preceding three years as ranked by the publications "Securities Data" or "Institutional Investor."  If the panel determines that a control premium exists for the retained interest, the panel shall determine the amount of the control premium, and the commission shall adopt the determination but may not increase the market value by a control premium greater than 10 percent.  The costs and expenses of the panel, as approved by the commission, shall be paid by each transferee corporation.  The determination of the commission based on the finding of the panel conclusively establishes the value of the common stock of each transferee corporation.  The book value of each transferee corporation's debt and preferred stock securities shall be added to the market value of its assets.  The market value of each transferee corporation's assets shall be reduced by the corresponding net book value of the assets acquired by each transferee corporation from any entity other than the affiliated electric utility or power generation company.  The resulting market value of the assets establishes the market value of the generation assets transferred by the electric utility or power generation company to each separate corporation.
    
    (4)  Exchange of Assets.  If, at any time after December 31, 1999, an electric utility or its affiliated power generation company has transferred some or all of its generation assets, including any fuel and fuel transportation contracts related to those assets, in a bona fide third-party exchange transaction, the stranded costs related to the transferred assets shall be the difference between the book value and the market value of the transferred assets at the time of the exchange, taking into account any other consideration received or given.  The market value of the transferred assets may be determined through an appraisal by a nationally recognized independent appraisal firm, if the market value is subject to a market valuation by means of an offer of sale in accordance with this subdivision.  To obtain a market valuation by means of an offer of sale, the owner of the asset shall offer it for sale to other parties under procedures that provide broad public notice of the offer and a reasonable opportunity for other parties to bid on the asset.  The owner of the asset may establish a reserve price for any offer based on the sum of the appraised value of the asset and the tax impact of selling the asset, as determined by the commission.
    
    (i)  Unless an electric utility or its affiliated power generation company combines all of its remaining generation assets into one or more transferee corporations as described in Subsections (h)(2) and (3), the electric utility shall quantify its stranded costs for nuclear assets using the ECOM method.  The ECOM method is the estimation model prepared for and described by the commission's April 1998 Report to the Texas Senate Interim Committee on Electric Restructuring entitled "Potentially Strandable Investment (ECOM) Report:  1998 Update."  The methodology used in the model must be the same as that used in the 1998 report to determine the "base case."  At the time of the proceeding under this section, the ECOM model shall be rerun using updated company-specific inputs required by the model, updating the market price of electricity, and using updated natural gas price forecasts and the capacity cost based on the long-run marginal cost of the most economic new generation technology then available.  Natural gas price projections used in the model must be market-based natural gas forward prices, where available.  Growth rates in generating plant operations and maintenance costs and allocated administrative and general costs shall be benchmarked by comparing those costs to the best available information on cost trends for comparable generating plants.  Capital additions shall be benchmarked using the limitation in Section [39.259](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.259)(b).
    
    (j)  The commission shall issue a final order not later than the 150th day after the date of the filing under this section by the transmission and distribution utility, its affiliated retail electric provider, and its affiliated power generation company, and the resulting order shall be subject to judicial review under Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code.
    
    (k)  Notwithstanding Section [39.252](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.252), to the extent that a customer's actual load has been lawfully served by a fully operational qualifying facility before September 1, 2001, or by an on-site power production facility with a rated capacity of 10 megawatts or less, any charge for recovery of stranded costs under this section or Subchapter G assessed on that customer after the facility becomes fully operational shall be included only in those tariffs or charges associated with the services actually provided by the transmission and distribution utility, if any, to the customer after the facility became fully operational and may not include any costs associated with the service provided to the customer by the electric utility or its affiliated transmission and distribution utility under their tariffs before the operation of that qualifying facility.  To qualify under this subsection, a qualifying facility must have made substantially complete filings on or before December 31, 1999, for all necessary site-specific environmental permits under the rules of the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission in effect at the time of filing.
    
    (l)  To protect retail customers in this state, and ensure the appropriateness of the nonbypassable rates of electric utilities and transmission and distribution utilities, notwithstanding any other provision of this title, an electric utility or transmission and distribution utility must report to and obtain approval of the commission before closing any transaction in which:
    
    (1)  the electric utility or transmission and distribution utility will be merged or consolidated with another electric utility or transmission and distribution utility;
    
    (2)  at least 50 percent of the stock of the electric utility or transmission and distribution utility will be transferred or sold; or
    
    (3)  a controlling interest or operational control of the electric utility or transmission and distribution utility will be transferred.
    
    (m)  The commission shall approve a transaction under Subsection (l) if the commission finds that the transaction is in the public interest.  In making its determination, the commission shall consider whether the transaction will adversely affect the reliability of service, availability of service, or cost of service of the electric utility or transmission and distribution utility.  The commission shall make the determination concerning a transaction under this subsection not later than the 180th day after the date the commission receives the relevant report.  The commission may extend the deadline provided by this subsection for not more than 60 days if the commission determines the extension is needed to evaluate additional information, to consider actions taken by other jurisdictions concerning the transaction, to provide for administrative efficiency, or for other good cause.  If the commission has not made a determination before the expiration of the deadline provided by or extended under this subsection, the transaction is considered approved.
    
    (n)  Subsections (l) and (m) do not apply to a transaction described by Subsection (l) for which a definitive agreement was executed before April 1, 2007, if an electric utility or transmission and distribution utility or a person seeking to acquire or merge with an electric utility or transmission and distribution utility made a filing for review of the transaction under Section [14.101](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=14.101) before May 1, 2007, and the resulting proceeding was not withdrawn.
    
    (o)  If an electric utility or transmission and distribution utility or a person seeking to acquire or merge with an electric utility or transmission and distribution utility files with the commission a stipulation, representation, or commitment in advance of or as part of a filing under Subsection (l) or under Section [14.101](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=14.101), the commission may enforce the stipulation, representation, or commitment to the extent that the stipulation, representation, or commitment is consistent with the standards provided by this section and Section [14.101](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=14.101).  The commission may reasonably interpret and enforce conditions adopted under this section.

    Sec. 39.263.  STRANDED COST RECOVERY OF ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP COSTS.  (a)  Subject to Subsection (c), capital costs incurred by an electric utility to improve air quality before January 1, 2002, are eligible for inclusion as net invested capital under Section [39.259](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.259), notwithstanding the limitations imposed under Sections [39.259](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.259)(b) and (c).
    
    (b)  Subject to Subsection (c), capital costs incurred by an electric utility or an affiliated power generation company to improve air quality after January 1, 2002, and before May 1, 2003, are eligible for inclusion in the determination of invested capital in the true-up proceeding under Section [39.262](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.262).
    
    (c)  Reasonable costs incurred under Subsections (a) and (b) shall be included as invested capital and considered in an electric utility's stranded cost determination only to the extent that:
    
    (1)  the cost is applied to offset or reduce the emission of airborne contaminants from an electric generating facility, where:
    
    (A)  the reduction or offset is determined by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission to be an essential component in achieving compliance with a national ambient air quality standard;  or
    
    (B)  the reduction or offset is necessary in order for an unpermitted electric generating facility to obtain a permit in the manner provided by Section [39.264](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.264);
    
    (2)  the retrofit decision is determined to be the most cost-effective after consideration of alternative measures, including the retirement of the generating facility;  and
    
    (3)  the amount and location of resulting emission reductions is consistent with the air quality goals and policies of the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission.
    
    (d)  If the retirement of a generating facility is the most cost-effective alternative, taking into account the cost of replacement generating capacity, the net book value, including retirement costs and offsetting salvage value, of the affected facility shall be included in the electric utility's stranded cost determination, notwithstanding Section [39.259](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.259)(c).

    Sec. 39.264.  EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS OF "GRANDFATHERED FACILITIES".  (a)  In this section:
    
    (1)  "Conservation commission" means the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission.
    
    (2)  "Electric generating facility" means a facility that generates electric energy for compensation and is owned or operated by a person in this state, including a municipal corporation, electric cooperative, or river authority.
    
    (b)  This section applies only to an electric generating facility existing on January 1, 1999, that is not subject to the requirement to obtain a permit under Section [382.0518](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=382.0518)(g), Health and Safety Code.
    
    (c)  It is the intent of the legislature that, for the 12-month period beginning on May 1, 2003, and for each 12-month period after the end of that period, total annual emissions of nitrogen oxides from facilities subject to this section may not exceed levels equal to 50 percent of the total emissions of that pollutant during 1997, as reported to the conservation commission, and total annual emissions of sulphur dioxides from coal-fired facilities subject to this section may not exceed levels equal to 75 percent of the total emissions of that pollutant during 1997, as reported to the conservation commission.  The limitations prescribed by this subsection may be met through an emissions allocation and allowance transfer system described by this section.
    
    (d)  A municipal corporation, electric cooperative, or river authority may exclude any electric generating facilities of 25 megawatts or less from the requirements prescribed by this section.  Not later than January 1, 2000, a municipal corporation, electric cooperative, or river authority must inform the conservation commission of its intent to exclude those facilities.
    
    (e)  The owner or operator of an electric generating facility shall apply to the conservation commission for a permit for the emission of air contaminants on or before September 1, 2000.  A permit issued by the conservation commission under this section shall require the facility to achieve emissions reductions or trading emissions allowances as provided by this section.  If the facility uses coal as a fuel, the permit must also be conditioned on the facility's emissions meeting opacity limitations provided by conservation commission rules.  Notwithstanding Section [382.0518](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=382.0518)(g), Health and Safety Code, a facility that does not obtain a permit as required by this subsection may not operate after May 1, 2003, unless the conservation commission finds good cause for an extension.
    
    (f)  The conservation commission shall develop rules for the permitting of electric generating facilities.  The rules adopted under this subsection shall provide, by region, for the allocation of emissions allowances of sulphur dioxides and nitrogen oxides among electric generating facilities and for facilities to trade emissions allowances for those contaminants.
    
    (g)  The conservation commission by rule shall establish an East Texas Region, a West Texas Region, and an El Paso Region for allocation of air contaminants under the permitting program under Subsection (f).  The East Texas Region must contain all counties traversed by or east of Interstate Highway 35 or Interstate Highway 37, including Bosque, Coryell, Hood, Parker, Somervell, and Wise counties.  The West Texas Region includes all of the state not contained in the East Texas Region or the El Paso Region.  The El Paso Region includes El Paso County.
    
    (h)  Not later than January 1, 2000, the conservation commission shall allocate to each electric generating facility in each region a number of annual emissions allowances, with each allowance equal to one ton of sulphur dioxides or of nitrogen oxides emitted in a year, that permit emissions of the contaminants from the facility in that year.  The conservation commission must allocate to each facility a number of emissions allowances equal to an emissions rate measured in pounds per million British thermal units divided by 2,000 and multiplied by the facility's total heat input in terms of million British thermal units during 1997.  For the East Texas Region, the emissions rate shall be 0.14 pounds per million British thermal units for nitrogen oxides and 1.38 pounds per million British thermal units for sulphur dioxides.  For the West Texas and El Paso regions, the emissions rate shall be 0.195 pounds per million British thermal units for nitrogen oxides.  Allowances for sulphur dioxides may only be allocated among coal-fired facilities.
    
    (i)  A person, municipal corporation, electric cooperative, or river authority that owns and operates an electric generating facility not covered by this section may elect to designate that facility to become subject to the requirements of this section and to receive emissions allowances for the purpose of complying with the emissions limitations prescribed by Subsection (c).  The conservation commission shall adopt rules governing this election that:
    
    (1)  require an owner or operator of an electric generating facility to designate to the conservation commission in its permit application under Subsection (e) any facilities that will become subject to this section;
    
    (2)  require the conservation commission, notwithstanding the allocation mechanism provided by Subsection (h), to allocate additional allowances to facilities governed by this subsection in an amount equal to each facility's actual emissions in tons in 1997;
    
    (3)  provide that any unit designated under this subsection may not transfer or bank allowances conserved as a result of reduced utilization or shutdown, except that the allowances may be transferred or carried forward for use in subsequent years to the extent that the reduced utilization or shutdown results from the replacement of thermal energy from the unit designated under this subsection with thermal energy generated by any other unit;  and
    
    (4)  provide that emissions reductions from electing facilities designated in this subsection may only be used to satisfy the emissions reductions for grandfathered facilities defined in Subsection (c) to the extent that reductions used to satisfy the limitations in Subsection (c) are beyond the requirements of any other state or federal standard, or both.
    
    (j)  The conservation commission by rule shall permit a facility to trade emissions allocations with other electric generating facilities only in the same region.
    
    (k)  The conservation commission by rule shall provide methods for the conservation commission to determine whether a facility complies with the permit issued under this section.  The rules must provide for:
    
    (1)  monitoring and reporting actual emissions of sulphur dioxides and nitrogen oxides from each facility;
    
    (2)  provisions for saving unused allowances for use in later years;  and
    
    (3)  a system for tracking traded allowances.
    
    (l)  A facility may not trade an unused allowance for a contaminant for use as a credit for another contaminant.
    
    (m)  A person possessing market power shall not withhold emissions allowances from the market in a manner that is unreasonably discriminatory or tends to unreasonably restrict, impair, or reduce the level of competition.
    
    (n)  The conservation commission shall penalize a facility that emits an air contaminant that exceeds the facility's allowances for that contaminant by:
    
    (1)  enforcing an administrative penalty, in an amount determined by conservation commission rules, for each ton of air contaminant emissions by which the facility exceeds its allocated emissions allowances;  and
    
    (2)  reducing the facility's emissions allowances for the next year by an amount of emissions equal to the excessive emissions in the year the facility emitted the excessive air contaminants.
    
    (o)  The conservation commission may penalize a facility that emits an air contaminant that exceeds the facility's allowances for that contaminant by:
    
    (1)  ordering the facility to cease operations;  or
    
    (2)  taking other enforcement action provided by conservation commission rules.
    
    (p)  The conservation commission by rule shall provide for a facility in the El Paso Region to meet emissions allowances by using credits from emissions reductions achieved in Ciudad Juarez, United Mexican States.
    
    (q)  If the conservation commission or the United States Environmental Protection Agency determines that reductions in nitrogen oxides emissions in the El Paso Region otherwise required by this section would result in increased ambient ozone levels in El Paso County, facilities in the El Paso Region are exempt from the nitrogen oxides reduction requirements.
    
    (r)  An applicant for a permit under Subsection (e) shall publish notice of intent to obtain the permit in accordance with Section [382.056](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=382.056), Health and Safety Code.  The conservation commission shall provide an opportunity for a public hearing and the submission of public comment and send notice of a decision on an application for a permit under Subsection (e) in the same manner as provided by Sections [382.0561](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=382.0561) and [382.0562](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=382.0562), Health and Safety Code.  The conservation commission shall review and renew a permit issued under this section in accordance with Section [382.055](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=382.055), Health and Safety Code.
    
    (s)  This section does not limit the authority of the conservation commission to require further reductions of nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxides, or any other pollutant from generating facilities subject to this section or Section [39.263](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.263).

    SUBCHAPTER G. SECURITIZATION
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 39.301.  PURPOSE.  The purpose of this subchapter is to enable utilities to use securitization financing to recover regulatory assets, all other amounts determined under Section [39.262](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.262), and any amounts being recovered under a competition transition charge determined as a result of the proceedings under Sections [39.201](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.201) and [39.262](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.262). This type of debt will lower the carrying costs of the assets relative to the costs that would be incurred using conventional utility financing methods.  The proceeds of the transition bonds shall be used solely for the purposes of reducing the amount of recoverable regulatory assets and other amounts, as determined by the commission in accordance with this chapter, through the refinancing or retirement of utility debt or equity.  The commission shall ensure that securitization provides tangible and quantifiable benefits to ratepayers, greater than would have been achieved absent the issuance of transition bonds.  The commission shall ensure that the structuring and pricing of the transition bonds result in the lowest transition bond charges consistent with market conditions and the terms of the financing order.  The amount securitized may not exceed the present value of the revenue requirement over the life of the proposed transition bond associated with the regulatory assets or other amounts sought to be securitized.  The present value calculation shall use a discount rate equal to the proposed interest rate on the transition bonds.

    Sec. 39.303.  FINANCING ORDERS;  TERMS.  (a)  The commission shall adopt a financing order, on application of a utility to recover the utility's regulatory assets and other amounts determined under Section [39.201](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.201) or [39.262](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.262), on making a finding that the total amount of revenues to be collected under the financing order is less than the revenue requirement that would be recovered over the remaining life of the regulatory assets or other amounts using conventional financing methods and that the financing order is consistent with the standards in Section [39.301](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.301).
    
    (b)  The financing order shall detail the amount of regulatory assets and other amounts to be recovered and the period over which the nonbypassable transition charges shall be recovered, which period may not exceed 15 years.  If an amount determined under Section [39.262](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.262) is subject to judicial review at the time of the securitization proceeding, the financing order shall include an adjustment mechanism requiring the utility to adjust its rates, other than transition charges, or provide credits, other than credits to transition charges, in a manner that would refund over the remaining life of the transition bonds any overpayments resulting from securitization of amounts in excess of the amount resulting from a final determination after completion of all appellate reviews.  The adjustment mechanism may not affect the stream of revenue available to service the transition bonds.  An adjustment may not be made under this subsection until all appellate reviews, including, if applicable, appellate reviews following a commission decision on remand of its original orders, have been completed.
    
    (c)  Transition charges shall be collected and allocated among customers in the same manner as competition transition charges under Section [39.201](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.201).
    
    (d)  A financing order shall become effective in accordance with its terms, and the financing order, together with the transition charges authorized in the order, shall thereafter be irrevocable and not subject to reduction, impairment, or adjustment by further action of the commission, except as permitted by Section [39.307](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.307).
    
    (e)  The commission shall issue a financing order under Subsections (a) and (g) not later than 90 days after the utility files its request for the financing order.
    
    (f)  A financing order is not subject to rehearing by the commission.  A financing order may be reviewed by appeal only to a Travis County district court by a party to the proceeding filed within 15 days after the financing order is signed by the commission.  The judgment of the district court may be reviewed only by direct appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas filed within 15 days after entry of judgment.  All appeals shall be heard and determined by the district court and the Supreme Court of Texas as expeditiously as possible with lawful precedence over other matters.  Review on appeal shall be based solely on the record before the commission and briefs to the court and shall be limited to whether the financing order conforms to the constitution and laws of this state and the United States and is within the authority of the commission under this chapter.
    
    (g)  At the request of an electric utility, the commission may adopt a financing order providing for retiring and refunding transition bonds on making a finding that the future transition charges required to service the new transition bonds, including transaction costs, will be less than the future transition charges required to service the transition bonds being refunded.  On the retirement of the refunded transition bonds, the commission shall adjust the related transition charges accordingly.

    Sec. 39.304.  PROPERTY RIGHTS.

    (b)  Transition property shall constitute a present property right for purposes of contracts concerning the sale or pledge of property, even though the imposition and collection of transition charges depends on further acts of the utility or others that have not yet occurred.  The financing order shall remain in effect and the property shall continue to exist for the same period as the pledge of the state described in Section [39.310](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.310).

    Sec. 39.308.  TRUE SALE.  An agreement by an electric utility or assignee to transfer transition property that expressly states that the transfer is a sale or other absolute transfer signifies that the transaction is a true sale and is not a secured transaction and that title, legal and equitable, has passed to the entity to which the transition property is transferred.  This true sale shall apply regardless of whether the purchaser has any recourse against the seller, or any other term of the parties' agreement, including the seller's retention of an equity interest in the transition property, the fact that the electric utility acts as the collector of transition charges relating to the transition property, or the treatment of the transfer as a financing for tax, financial reporting, or other purposes.

    Sec. 39.309.  SECURITY INTERESTS;  ASSIGNMENT;  COMMINGLING;  DEFAULT.  (a)  Transition property does not constitute an account or general intangible under Section [9.106](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.106), Business & Commerce Code.  The creation, granting, perfection, and enforcement of liens and security interests in transition property are governed by this section and not by the Business & Commerce Code.
    
    (b)  A valid and enforceable lien and security interest in transition property may be created only by a financing order and the execution and delivery of a security agreement with a financing party in connection with the issuance of transition bonds.  The lien and security interest shall attach automatically from the time that value is received for the bonds and, on perfection through the filing of notice with the secretary of state in accordance with the rules prescribed under Subsection (d), shall be a continuously perfected lien and security interest in the transition property and all proceeds of the property, whether accrued or not, shall have priority in the order of filing and take precedence over any subsequent judicial or other lien creditor.  If notice is filed within 10 days after value is received for the transition bonds, the security interest shall be perfected retroactive to the date value was received, otherwise, the security interest shall be perfected as of the date of filing.
    
    (c)  Transfer of an interest in transition property to an assignee shall be perfected against all third parties, including subsequent judicial or other lien creditors, when the financing order becomes effective, transfer documents have been delivered to the assignee, and a notice of that transfer has been filed in accordance with the rules prescribed under Subsection (d);  provided, however, that if notice of the transfer has not been filed in accordance with this subsection within 10 days after the delivery of transfer documentation, the transfer of the interest is not perfected against third parties until the notice is filed.
    
    (d)  The secretary of state shall implement this section by establishing and maintaining a separate system of records for the filing of notices under this section and prescribing the rules for those filings based on Chapter [9](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9), Business & Commerce Code, adapted to this subchapter and using the terms defined in this subchapter.
    
    (e)  The priority of a lien and security interest perfected under this section is not impaired by any later modification of the financing order under Section [39.307](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.307) or by the commingling of funds arising from transition charges with other funds, and any other security interest that may apply to those funds shall be terminated when they are transferred to a segregated account for the assignee or a financing party.  If transition property has been transferred to an assignee, any proceeds of that property shall be held in trust for the assignee.
    
    (f)  If a default or termination occurs under the transition bonds, the financing parties or their representatives may foreclose on or otherwise enforce their lien and security interest in any transition property as if they were secured parties under Chapter [9](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9), Business & Commerce Code, and the commission may order that amounts arising from transition charges be transferred to a separate account for the financing parties' benefit, to which their lien and security interest shall apply.  On application by or on behalf of the financing parties, a district court of Travis County shall order the sequestration and payment to them of revenues arising from the transition charges.

    Sec. 39.310.  PLEDGE OF STATE.  Transition bonds are not a debt or obligation of the state and are not a charge on its full faith and credit or taxing power.  The state pledges, however, for the benefit and protection of financing parties and the electric utility, that it will not take or permit any action that would impair the value of transition property, or, except as permitted by Section [39.307](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.307), reduce, alter, or impair the transition charges to be imposed, collected, and remitted to financing parties, until the principal, interest and premium, and any other charges incurred and contracts to be performed in connection with the related transition bonds have been paid and performed in full.  Any party issuing transition bonds is authorized to include this pledge in any documentation relating to those bonds.

    SUBCHAPTER I. PROVISIONS FOR CERTAIN NON-ERCOT UTILITIES
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 39.401.  APPLICABILITY.  This subchapter shall apply to investor-owned electric utilities operating solely outside of ERCOT having fewer than six synchronous interconnections with voltage levels above 69 kilovolts systemwide on the effective date of this subchapter.  The legislature finds that circumstances exist that require that areas served by such utilities be treated as competitive development areas in which it is not in the public interest to transition to full retail customer choice at this time.
    
    
    
    
    Added by Acts 1999, 76th Leg., ch. 405, Sec. 39, eff. Sept. 1, 1999.  Amended by Acts 2001, 77th Leg., ch. 1041, Sec. 1, eff. June 15, 2001.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 39.402.  REGULATION OF UTILITY AND TRANSITION TO COMPETITION.  (a)  Until the date on which an electric utility subject to this subchapter is authorized by the commission to implement customer choice, the rates of the utility shall be regulated under traditional cost of service regulation and the utility is subject to all applicable regulatory authority prescribed by this subtitle and Subtitle A, including Chapters [14](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=14), [32](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=32), [33](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=33), [36](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=36), and [37](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=37). Until the date on which an electric utility subject to this subchapter implements customer choice, the provisions of this chapter, other than this subchapter, Sections [39.1516](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.1516) and [39.905](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.905), and the provisions relating to the duty to obtain a permit from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for an electric generating facility and to reduce emissions from an electric generating facility, shall not apply to that utility. That portion of any commission order entered before September 1, 2001, to comply with this subchapter shall be null and void.
    
    (b)  Until the date on which an electric utility subject to this subchapter implements customer choice, Section [33.008](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=33.008) does not apply and the utility shall pay franchise fees to a municipality as required by the utility's franchise agreement with the municipality.  After the date on which an electric utility subject to this subchapter implements customer choice, Section [33.008](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=33.008) applies.  However, for purposes of computing the franchise fees as provided by Section [33.008](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=33.008)(b), the calendar year immediately preceding the implementation of customer choice shall be substituted for the year 1998.
    
    (c)  On or after January 1, 2007, an electric utility subject to this subchapter may choose to participate in customer choice.  An electric utility that chooses to participate in customer choice shall file a transition to competition plan with the commission.  This transition to competition plan shall identify how utilities subject to this subchapter intend to mitigate market power and achieve full customer choice, including specific alternatives for constructing additional transmission facilities, auctioning rights to generation capacity, divesting generation capacity, or any other measure that is consistent with the public interest.  The utility shall also include in the transition to competition plan a provision to establish a price to beat for residential customers and commercial customers having a peak load of 1,000 kilowatts or less.  The commission may prescribe additional information or provisions that must be included in the plan.  The commission shall approve, modify, or reject a plan within 180 days after the date of a filing under this section;  provided, however, that if a hearing is requested by any party to the proceeding, the 180-day deadline will be extended one day for each day of hearings.  The transition to competition plan may be updated or amended annually, subject to commission approval until the applicable power region is certified as a qualifying power region under Section [39.152](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.152).
    
    (d)  On implementation of customer choice, an electric utility subject to this subchapter is subject to the provisions of this subtitle and Subtitle A to the same extent as other electric utilities, including the provisions of Chapter [37](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=37) concerning certificates of convenience and necessity.
    
    (e)  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), an electric utility subject to this subchapter that elects to deploy advanced metering and meter information networks may recover reasonable and necessary costs incurred in deploying advanced metering and meter information networks. An electric utility that elects to deploy advanced metering or meter information networks is subject to commission rules adopted under Sections [39.107](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.107)(h) and (k).  The commission shall ensure that any deployment plan approved under this section and any related customer surcharge:
    
    (1)  are not applicable to customer accounts that receive service at transmission voltage; and
    
    (2)  are consistent with commission rules related to advanced metering systems regarding:
    
    (A)  customer protections;
    
    (B)  data security, privacy, and  ownership; and 
    
    (C)  options given consumers to continue to receive service through a non-advanced meter.
    
    (f)  An electric utility subject to this subchapter that elects to deploy an advanced meter information network shall deploy the network as rapidly as practicable to allow customers to better manage energy use and control costs.

    Sec. 39.407.  CUSTOMER CHOICE AND RELEVANT MARKET AND RELATED MATTERS.  (a)  If an electric utility chooses on or after January 1, 2007, to participate in customer choice, the commission may not authorize customer choice until the applicable power region has been certified as a qualifying power region under Section [39.152](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.152)(a).  Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, the commission shall certify that the requirements of Section [39.152](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.152)(a)(3) are met for electric utilities subject to this subchapter only upon a finding that the total capacity owned and controlled by each such electric utility and its affiliates does not exceed 20 percent of the total installed generation capacity within the constrained geographic region served by each such electric utility plus the total available transmission capacity capable of delivering firm power and energy to that constrained geographic region.  Not later than May 1, 2002, each electric utility subject to this subchapter shall submit to the electric utility restructuring legislative oversight committee an analysis of the needed transmission facilities necessary to make the electric utility's service area transmission capability comparable to areas within the ERCOT power region.  On or after September 1, 2003, each electric utility subject to this subchapter shall file the utility's plans to develop the utility's transmission interconnections with the utility's power region or other adjacent power regions.  The commission shall review the plan and not later than the 180th day after the date the plan is filed, determine the additional transmission facilities necessary to provide access to power and energy that is comparable to the access provided in areas within the ERCOT power region;  provided, however, that if a hearing is requested by any party to the proceeding, the 180-day deadline will be extended one day for each day of hearings.  The commission shall, as a part of the commission's approval of the plan, approve a rate rider mechanism for the recovery of the incremental costs of those facilities after the facilities are completed and in-service.  A finding of need under this subsection shall meet the requirements of Sections [37.056](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=37.056)(c)(1), (2), and (4)(E).  The commission may certify that the requirements of Section [39.152](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.152)(a)(3) are met for electric utilities subject to this subchapter if the commission finds that:
    
    (1)  each such utility has sufficient transmission facilities to provide customers access to power and energy from capacity controlled by suppliers not affiliated with the incumbent utility that is comparable to the access to power and energy from capacity controlled by suppliers not affiliated with the incumbent utilities in areas of the ERCOT power region;  and
    
    (2)  the total capacity owned and controlled by each such electric utility and its affiliates does not exceed 20 percent of the total installed generation capacity within the power region.
    
    (b)  In the area of a power region served by an electric utility subject to this subchapter, the electric utility may not choose to participate in customer choice unless the affiliated power generation company makes a commitment to maintain and does maintain rates that are based on cost of service for any electric cooperative or municipally owned utility that was a wholesale customer on the date the utility chooses to participate in customer choice and was purchasing power at rates that were based on cost of service.  This subsection requires a power generation company to sell power at rates that are based on cost of service, notwithstanding the expiration of a contract for that service, until the requirements of Section [39.152](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.152)(a) are met.
    
    (c)  If the requirements of Section [39.152](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.152)(a) have not been met for an electric utility subject to this subchapter when the electric utility chooses to participate in customer choice, then any power generation company in the power region affiliated with an electric utility subject to this subchapter shall maintain adequate supply and facilities to provide electric service to persons who were retail customers of the electric utility on the date the utility chooses to participate in customer choice.  The obligation provided by this subsection remains in effect until the commission determines that the requirements of Section [39.152](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.152)(a) have been met for the region.

    Sec. 39.451.  APPLICABILITY.  This subchapter applies only to an investor-owned electric utility  that is operating solely outside of ERCOT in areas of this state that were included in the Southeastern Electric Reliability Council on January 1, 2005.
    
    
    
    
    Added by Acts 2005, 79th Leg., Ch. 1072 (H.B. [1567](http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/79R/billtext/html/HB01567F.HTM)), Sec. 1, eff. June 18, 2005.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 39.452.  REGULATION OF UTILITY AND TRANSITION TO COMPETITION.  (a)  Until the date on which an electric utility subject to this subchapter is authorized by the commission to implement customer choice under Section [39.453](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.453), the rates of the electric utility shall be regulated under traditional cost-of-service regulation and the electric utility is subject to all applicable regulatory authority prescribed by this subtitle and Subtitle A, including Chapters [14](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=14), [32](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=32), [33](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=33), [36](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=36), and [37](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=37).
    
    (b)  An electric utility subject to this subchapter shall propose a competitive generation tariff to allow eligible customers the ability to contract for competitive generation.  The commission shall approve, reject, or modify the proposed tariff not later than September 1, 2010.  The tariffs subject to this subsection may not be considered to offer a discounted rate or rates under Section [36.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=36.007), and the utility's rates shall be set, in the proceeding in which the tariff is adopted, to recover any costs unrecovered as a result of the implementation of the tariff.  The commission shall ensure that a competitive generation tariff shall not be implemented in a manner that harms the sustainability or competitiveness of manufacturers that choose not to take advantage of competitive generation.  Pursuant to the competitive generation tariff, an electric utility subject to this subsection shall purchase competitive generation service, selected by the customer, and provide the generation at retail to the customer.  An electric utility subject to this subsection shall provide and price retail transmission service, including necessary ancillary services, to retail customers who choose to take advantage of the competitive generation tariff at a rate that is unbundled from the utility's cost of service.  Such customers shall not be considered wholesale transmission customers.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the commission may not issue a decision relating to a competitive generation tariff that is contrary to an applicable decision, rule, or policy statement of a federal regulatory agency having jurisdiction.
    
    (c)  That portion of any commission order issued before the effective date of this section requiring the electric utility to comply with a provision of this chapter is void.
    
    (d)  Until the date on which an electric utility subject to this subchapter implements customer choice:
    
    (1)  the provisions of this chapter do not apply to that electric utility, other than this subchapter, Sections [39.1516](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.1516) and [39.905](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.905), the provisions relating to the duty to obtain a permit from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for an electric generating facility and to reduce emissions from an electric generating facility, and the provisions of Subchapter G that pertain to the recovery and securitization of hurricane reconstruction costs authorized by Sections 39.458-39.463; and
    
    (2)  the electric utility is not subject to a rate freeze and, subject to the limitation provided by Subsection (b), may file for rate changes under Chapter [36](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=36) and for approval of one or more of the rate rider mechanisms authorized by Sections [39.454](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.454) and [39.455](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.455).
    
    (e)  An electric utility subject to this subchapter may proceed with and complete jurisdictional separation to establish two vertically integrated utilities, one of which is solely subject to the retail jurisdiction of the commission and one of which is solely subject to the retail jurisdiction of the Louisiana Public Service Commission.
    
    (f)  Not later than January 1, 2006, an electric utility subject to this subchapter shall file a plan with the commission for identifying the applicable power region or power regions, enumerating the steps to achieve the certification of a power region in accordance with Section [39.453](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.453), and specifying the schedule for achieving the certification of a power region. The utility may amend the plan as appropriate. The commission may, on its own motion or the motion of any affected person, initiate a proceeding to certify a qualified power region under Section [39.152](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.152) when the conditions supporting such a proceeding exist.
    
    (g)  Not later than the earlier of January 1, 2007, or the 90th day after the date the applicable power region is certified in accordance with Section [39.453](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.453), the electric utility shall file a transition to competition plan. The transition to competition plan must:
    
    (1)  identify how the electric utility intends to mitigate market power and to achieve full customer choice, including specific alternatives for constructing additional transmission facilities, auctioning rights to generation capacity, divesting generation capacity, or any other measure that is consistent with the public interest;
    
    (2)  include a provision to reinstate a customer choice pilot project and to establish a price to beat for residential customers and commercial customers having a peak load of 1,000 kilowatts or less; and
    
    (3)  include any other additional information or provisions that the commission may require.
    
    (h)  The commission shall approve, modify, or reject a plan filed under Subsection (g) not later than the 180th day after the date the plan is filed unless a hearing is requested by any party to the proceeding.  A modification to the plan by the commission may not be in conflict with the jurisdiction or orders of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or result in significant additional cost without allowing for timely recovery for that cost.  If a hearing is requested, the 180-day deadline is extended one day for each day of the hearing.  The transition to competition plan shall be updated or amended annually, subject to commission approval, until the initiation of customer choice by an electric utility subject to this subchapter.  Consistent with its jurisdiction, the commission shall have the authority in approving or modifying the transition to competition plan to require the electric utility to take reasonable steps to facilitate the development of a wholesale generation market within the boundaries of the electric utility's service territory.
    
    (i)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if the commission has not approved the transition to competition plan under this section before January 1, 2009, an electric utility subject to this subchapter shall cease all activities relating to the transition to competition under this section.  The commission may, on its own motion or the motion of any affected person, initiate a proceeding under Section [39.152](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.152) to certify a power region to which the utility belongs as a qualified power region when the conditions supporting such a proceeding exist.  The commission may not approve a plan under Subsection (g) until the expiration of four years from the time that the commission certifies a power region under Subsection (f).  If after the expiration of four years from the time the commission certifies a power region under Subsection (f), and after notice and a hearing, the commission determines consistent with the study required by Section 5, S.B. No. 1492, Acts of the 81st Legislature, Regular Session, 2009, that the electric utility cannot comply with Section [38.073](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=38.073), it shall consider approving a plan under Subsection (g).
    
    (j)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle, in awarding a certificate of convenience and necessity or allowing cost recovery for purchased power by an electric utility subject to this section, the commission shall ensure in its determination that the provisions of Sections [37.056](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=37.056)(c)(4)(D) and (E) are met and that the generating facility or the purchased power agreement satisfies the identified reliability needs of the utility.
    
    (k)  Notwithstanding Subsection (d), an electric utility subject to this subchapter that elects to deploy advanced metering and meter information networks may recover reasonable and necessary costs incurred in deploying advanced metering and meter information networks.  An electric utility that elects to deploy advanced metering or meter information networks is subject to commission rules adopted under Sections [39.107](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.107)(h) and (k).  The commission shall ensure that any deployment plan approved under this section and any related customer surcharge:
    
    (1)  are not applicable to customer accounts that receive service at transmission voltage; and
    
    (2)  are consistent with commission rules related to advanced metering systems regarding:
    
    (A)  customer protections;
    
    (B)  data security, privacy, and ownership; and 
    
    (C)  options given consumers to continue to receive service through a non-advanced meter.
    
    (l)  An electric utility subject to this subchapter that elects to deploy an advanced meter information network shall deploy the network as rapidly as practicable to allow customers to better manage energy use and control costs.

    Sec. [39.458](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.458).  RECOVERY AND SECURITIZATION OF HURRICANE RECONSTRUCTION COSTS; PURPOSE.  (a)  The purpose of this section and of Sections 39.459-39.463 is to enable an electric utility subject to this subchapter to obtain timely recovery of hurricane reconstruction costs and to use securitization financing to recover these costs, because that type of debt will lower the carrying costs associated with the recovery of hurricane reconstruction costs relative to the costs that would be incurred using conventional financing methods.  The proceeds of the transition bonds may be used only for the purposes of reducing the amount of recoverable hurricane reconstruction costs, as determined by the commission in accordance with this subchapter, through the refinancing or retirement of utility debt or equity.
    
    (b)  It is the intent of the legislature that:
    
    (1)  securitization of hurricane reconstruction costs will be subject to the same procedures, standards, and protections for the securitization of stranded costs and regulatory assets under Subchapter G in effect on the effective date of this section, except as provided by this subchapter; and
    
    (2)  the commission will ensure that securitization of hurricane reconstruction costs provides greater tangible and quantifiable benefits to ratepayers than would have been achieved without the issuance of transition bonds.

    Sec. [39.459](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.459).  HURRICANE RECONSTRUCTION COSTS.  (a)  In this subchapter:
    
    (1)  "Hurricane reconstruction costs" means reasonable and necessary costs, including costs expensed, charged to the storm reserve, or capitalized, that are incurred by an electric utility subject to this subchapter due to any activity or activities conducted by or on behalf of the electric utility in connection with the restoration of service associated with electric power outages affecting customers of the electric utility as the result of Hurricane Rita, including mobilization, staging, and construction, reconstruction, replacement, or repair of electric generation, transmission, distribution, or general plant facilities.
    
    (2)  "Hurricane Rita" means the hurricane of that name that struck the coastal region of this state in September 2005.
    
    (b)  If the commission determines it to be appropriate, hurricane reconstruction costs may include carrying costs from the date on which the hurricane reconstruction costs were incurred until the date that transition bonds are issued.
    
    (c)  To the extent a utility subject to this subchapter receives insurance proceeds, governmental grants, or any other source of funding that compensates it for hurricane reconstruction costs, those amounts shall be used to reduce the utility's hurricane reconstruction costs recoverable from customers.  If the timing of a utility's receipt of those amounts prevents their inclusion as a reduction to the hurricane reconstruction costs that are securitized, the commission shall take those amounts into account in:
    
    (1)  the utility's next base rate proceeding; or
    
    (2)  any proceeding in which the commission considers hurricane reconstruction costs.

    Sec. [39.460](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.460).  STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES GOVERNING SECURITIZATION OF HURRICANE RECONSTRUCTION COSTS.  (a)  The procedures and standards of this subchapter and the provisions of Subchapter G govern the application for, and the commission's issuance of, a financing order to provide for the securitization of hurricane reconstruction costs by an electric utility subject to this subchapter.
    
    (b)  Subject to the standards, procedures, and tests contained in this subchapter and Subchapter G, the commission shall adopt a financing order on the application of the utility to recover its hurricane reconstruction costs.  On the commission's issuance of a financing order allowing for recovery and securitization of hurricane reconstruction costs, the provisions of this subchapter and Subchapter G continue to govern the financing order and the rights and interests established in the order, and this subchapter and Subchapter G continue to govern any transition bonds issued pursuant to the financing order.  To the extent any conflict exists between the provisions of this subchapter and Subchapter G in cases involving the securitization of hurricane reconstruction costs, the provisions of this subchapter control.
    
    (c)  For purposes of this subchapter, "financing order," as defined by Section [39.302](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.302) and as used in Subchapter G, includes a financing order authorizing the securitization of hurricane reconstruction costs.
    
    (d)  For purposes of this subchapter, "qualified costs," as defined by Section [39.302](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.302) and as used in Subchapter G, includes 100 percent of the electric utility's hurricane reconstruction costs together with the costs of issuing, supporting, and servicing transition bonds and any costs of retiring and refunding existing debt and equity securities of an electric utility subject to this subchapter in connection with the issuance of transition bonds.  For purposes of this subchapter, the term also includes the costs to the commission of acquiring professional services for the purpose of evaluating proposed transactions under this subchapter.
    
    (e)  For purposes of this subchapter, "transition bonds," as defined by Section [39.302](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.302) and as used in Subchapter G, includes transition bonds issued in association with the recovery of hurricane reconstruction costs.  Transition bonds issued to securitize hurricane reconstruction costs may be called "hurricane reconstruction bonds" or may be called by any other name acceptable to the issuer and the underwriters of the transition bonds.
    
    (f)  For purposes of this subchapter, "transition charges," as defined by Section [39.302](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.302) and as used in Subchapter G, includes nonbypassable amounts to be charged for the use of electric services, approved by the commission under a financing order to recover hurricane reconstruction costs, that shall be collected by an electric utility subject to this subchapter, its successors, an assignee, or other collection agents as provided for in the financing order.
    
    (g)  Notwithstanding Section [39.303](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.303)(c), hurricane reconstruction costs shall be functionalized and allocated to customers in the same manner as the corresponding facilities and related expenses are functionalized and allocated in the utility's current base rates.
    
    (h)  The amount of any accumulated deferred federal income taxes offset, used to determine the securitization total, may not be considered in future rate proceedings.  Any tax obligation of the electric utility arising from its receipt of securitization bond proceeds, or from the collection and remittance of transition charges, shall be recovered by the electric utility through the commission's implementation of Section [39.458](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.458), Section [39.459](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.459), this section, and Sections 39.461-39.463.
    
    (i)  If the commission determines that recovery of all or any portion of an electric utility's hurricane reconstruction costs using securitization is not beneficial to ratepayers of the electric utility, under one or more of the tests applied to determine those benefits, the commission shall permit the electric utility to recover the entirety of the hurricane reconstruction costs through an appropriate customer surcharge mechanism, including appropriate carrying costs, provided that the electric utility has not securitized any portion of its hurricane reconstruction costs.  A rate proceeding under Chapter [36](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=36) may not be required to determine and implement this surcharge mechanism.  A rider adopted under this subsection must expire on the implementation of rates resulting from the filing of a Subchapter [C](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=36.101), Chapter [36](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=36), rate proceeding.

    Sec. 39.462.  DETERMINATION OF HURRICANE RECONSTRUCTION COSTS.  (a)  An electric utility subject to this subchapter is entitled to recover hurricane reconstruction costs consistent with the provisions of this subchapter and is entitled to seek recovery of amounts not recovered under this subchapter, including hurricane reconstruction costs not yet incurred at the time an application is filed under Subsection (b), in its next base rate proceeding or through any other proceeding authorized by Subchapter [C](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=36.101), Chapter [36](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=36).
    
    (b)  The commission shall issue an order determining the amount of hurricane reconstruction costs eligible for recovery and securitization not later than the 150th day after the date an electric utility subject to this subchapter files an application seeking that determination.  The 150-day period begins on the date the electric utility files the application, even if the filing occurs before the effective date of this section.
    
    (c)  On issuance by the commission of an order determining the amount of eligible hurricane reconstruction costs, an electric utility subject to this subchapter may file an application for a financing order, which shall be governed by the procedures in Subchapter G.
    
    (d)  To the extent the commission has made a determination of the eligible hurricane reconstruction costs of an electric utility subject to this subchapter before the effective date of this section, that determination may provide the basis for the utility's application for a financing order pursuant to this subchapter and Subchapter G.  A previous commission determination does not preclude the utility from requesting recovery of additional hurricane reconstruction costs eligible for recovery under this subchapter, but not previously authorized by the commission.
    
    (e)  A rate proceeding under Chapter [36](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=36) is not required to determine the amount of recoverable hurricane reconstruction costs as provided by this section.

    SUBCHAPTER M.  WINTER STORM URI DEFAULT BALANCE FINANCING
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 39.601.  PURPOSE.  (a) The purpose of this subchapter is to address the Winter Storm Uri default balance, as defined by Section [39.602](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.602), in a manner that benefits the public interest by:
    
    (1)  enabling the independent organization to finance the payment of the default balance with debt obligations; and
    
    (2)  authorizing the commission to contract with the comptroller under Section [404.0241](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=404.0241), Government Code, to finance the payment of the default balance with debt obligations.
    
    (b)  Financing the default balance in the manner provided by this subchapter will:
    
    (1)  allow wholesale market participants that are owed money to be paid in a more timely manner;
    
    (2)  replenish financial revenue auction receipts temporarily used by the independent organization to reduce the Winter Storm Uri-related amounts short-paid to the wholesale market participants; and
    
    (3)  allow the wholesale market to repay the default balance over time.
    
    (c)  The legislature finds that the financing authorized by this subchapter serves the public purpose of preserving the integrity of the electricity market in the ERCOT power region.
    
    (d)  The proceeds of debt obligations issued under this subchapter must be used solely for the purpose of financing default balances that otherwise would be or have been uplifted to the wholesale market.
    
    (e)  The commission shall ensure that the structuring and pricing of debt obligations issued under this subchapter result in the lowest financing costs consistent with market conditions and the terms of the commission's order.  The present value calculation must use a discount rate equal to the proposed interest rate on the debt obligations.

    Sec. 39.602.  DEFINITIONS.  In this subchapter:
    
    (1)  "Default balance" means an amount of money of not more than $800 million that includes only:
    
    (A)  amounts owed to the independent organization by competitive wholesale market participants from the period of emergency that otherwise would be or have been uplifted to other wholesale market participants;
    
    (B)  financial revenue auction receipts used by the independent organization to temporarily reduce amounts short-paid to wholesale market participants related to the period of emergency; and
    
    (C)  reasonable costs incurred by a state agency or the independent organization to implement a debt obligation order under Sections [39.603](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.603) and [39.604](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.604), including the cost of retiring or refunding existing debt.
    
    (2)  "Default charges" means charges assessed to wholesale market participants to repay amounts financed under this subchapter to pay the default balance.
    
    (3)  "Independent organization" means the independent organization certified under Section [39.151](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.151) for the ERCOT power region.

    Sec. 39.603.  DEBT OBLIGATION ORDER.  (a)  On application by the independent organization, the commission by order may authorize the independent organization to establish a debt financing mechanism to finance the default balance if the commission finds that the debt obligations are needed to preserve the integrity of the wholesale market and the public interest, after considering:
    
    (1)  the need to timely replenish financial revenue auction receipts used by the independent organization to reduce amounts short-paid to wholesale market participants;
    
    (2)  the interests of wholesale market participants that are owed balances; and
    
    (3)  the potential effects of uplifting those balances to the wholesale market without a financing vehicle.
    
    (b)  The order must state:
    
    (1)  the default balance to be financed; and
    
    (2)  the period over which the default charges must be assessed to repay the debt obligations, which may not exceed 30 years.
    
    (c)  The order must include an adjustment mechanism requiring the independent organization to adjust default charges to refund, over the remaining period of the default charges, any payments made by a market participant toward unpaid obligations from the period of emergency that were included in the financed default balance.
    
    (d)  The independent organization shall collect from and allocate among wholesale market participants the default charges using the same allocated pro rata share methodology under which the charges would otherwise be uplifted under the protocols in effect on March 1, 2021.  The default charges must be assessed on all wholesale market participants, including market participants who are in default but still participating in the wholesale market and who enter the market after a debt obligation order is issued under this subchapter, and may be based on periodically updated transaction data to prevent market participants from engaging in behavior designed to avoid the default charges.
    
    (e)  Not later than the 30th day after the date the independent organization receives a default charge payment from a wholesale market participant, the independent organization shall remit the payment to the comptroller toward repayment of debt obligations in which the comptroller made an investment under Section [404.0241](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=404.0241)(b-1), Government Code, if applicable.
    
    (f)  Notwithstanding another provision of this subchapter, default charges may not be collected from or allocated to a market participant that:
    
    (1)  otherwise would be subject to a default charge solely as a result of acting as a central counterparty clearinghouse in wholesale market transactions in the ERCOT power region; and
    
    (2)  is regulated as a derivatives clearing organization, as defined by Section 1a, Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. Section 1a).
    
    (g)  Not later than the 90th day after the date the independent organization files an application for an order under Subsection (a), the commission shall issue an order described by Subsection (a) or an order denying the application.  The order becomes effective in accordance with its terms and the order, together with the default charges authorized in the order, shall be irrevocable and not subject to reduction, impairment, or adjustment by further action of the commission after the order takes effect.  Notwithstanding this requirement, the commission may refinance any debt obligations created by an order issued under this subchapter if the commission determines that the refinancing is in the public interest, considering the interest of both the ERCOT market and the state's interest in the economic stabilization fund, and otherwise meets the requirements of this subchapter.
    
    (h)  An order described by Subsection (a) or (g) is not subject to rehearing by the commission. The order may be reviewed by appeal by a party to the proceeding to a Travis County district court that is filed not later than the 15th day after the date the order is signed by the commission.  The judgment of the district court may be reviewed only by a direct appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas that is filed not later than the 15th day after the date of the entry of judgment.  All appeals shall be heard and determined by the district court and the Supreme Court of Texas as expeditiously as possible with lawful precedence over other matters.  Review on appeal shall be based solely on the record before the commission and briefs to the court and shall be limited to whether the order conforms to the constitution and laws of this state and the United States and is within the authority of the commission under this chapter.
    
    (i)  A debt obligation issued under this section is a nonrecourse debt secured solely by the default charges explicitly assessed to repay the obligation. The independent organization's obligations authorized under this section do not create personal liability for the independent organization.

    Sec. 39.604.  COMMISSION-AUTHORIZED FINANCING.  (a) The commission may contract with another state agency with expertise in public financing to establish a debt financing mechanism for the payment of the default balance as defined in this subchapter, under an order that meets the requirements of Section [39.603](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.603). This section does not apply to a default balance securitized under Subchapter [D](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=41.151), Chapter [41](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=41).
    
    (b)  The contracted state agency and any issuer, along with the independent organization, must be a party to the commission's proceedings that address the issuance of an order.
    
    (c)  In addition to the other applicable requirements of this subtitle, an order issued under this section must:
    
    (1)  require the sale, assignment, or other transfer to the contracted state agency of default charges created by the order and, following that sale, assignment, or transfer, require that default charges paid under any order be created, assessed, and collected as the property of the contracted state agency, subject to subsequent sale, assignment, or transfer by the contracted state agency as authorized under this subchapter;
    
    (2)  authorize:
    
    (A)  the issuance of debt obligations by the contracted state agency secured by a pledge of default charge revenue, and the application of the proceeds of those debt obligations, net of issuance costs, to the independent organization; or
    
    (B)  the acquisition of default charge revenue from the independent organization by the contracted state agency, financed:
    
    (i)  by a loan by an issuer to the contracted state agency of the proceeds of debt obligations, net of issuance costs; or
    
    (ii)  by the acquisition by an issuer from the contracted state agency of the default charge revenue and in each case the pledge of the revenue to the repayment of the loan or other debt obligation, as applicable; and
    
    (3)  authorize the independent organization to serve as collection agent to collect the default charges and transfer the collected default charges to the contracted state agency or the issuer, as appropriate.
    
    (d)  After issuance of the order, the contracted state agency shall arrange for the issuance of debt obligations, as specified by the order, by the contracted state agency or another issuer selected by the contracted state agency and approved by the commission.
    
    (e)  Debt obligations issued pursuant to an order issued under this section are secured only by the default charge revenue and any other funds pledged under the bond documents.  No assets of the state or the independent organization are subject to claims by the holders of the debt obligations.

    SUBCHAPTER N.  WINTER STORM URI UPLIFT FINANCING
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 39.651.  PURPOSE; USE OF PROCEEDS.  (a) The purpose of this subchapter is to address the Winter Storm Uri uplift balance by:
    
    (1)  enabling the independent organization certified under Section [39.151](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.151) for the ERCOT power region to finance the uplift balance on behalf of wholesale market participants through debt obligations; and
    
    (2)  authorizing the commission to contract with another state agency to finance the payment of the uplift balance with debt obligations or use any another financial mechanism consistent with this subchapter for that purpose.
    
    (b)  Financing the uplift balance in the manner provided by this subchapter will allow wholesale market participants who were assessed extraordinary uplift charges due to consumption during the period of emergency to pay those charges over a longer period of time, alleviating liquidity issues and reducing the risk of additional defaults in the wholesale market.
    
    (c)  The legislature finds that authorizing financing under this subchapter serves the public purpose of allowing the commission to stabilize the wholesale electricity market in the ERCOT power region.
    
    (d)  The proceeds of debt obligations issued under this subchapter must be used solely for the purpose of financing reliability deployment price adder charges and ancillary service costs that exceeded the commission's system-wide offer cap and were uplifted to load-serving entities based on consumption during the period of emergency.  A load-serving entity that receives proceeds from the debt obligations may use the proceeds solely for the purposes of fulfilling payment obligations directly related to such costs and refunding such costs to retail customers who have paid or otherwise would be obligated to pay such costs.
    
    (e)  The commission shall ensure that the structuring and pricing of the debt obligations results in the lowest uplift charges consistent with market conditions and the terms of the order issued under this subchapter.  The present value calculation must use a discount rate equal to the proposed interest rate on the debt obligations.

    (1)  "Independent organization" means the independent organization certified under Section [39.151](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.151) for the ERCOT power region.
    
    (2)  "Load-serving entity" means a municipally owned utility, an electric cooperative, or a retail electric provider.
    
    (3)  "Period of emergency" means the period beginning 12:01 a.m., February 12, 2021, and ending 11:59 p.m., February 20, 2021.
    
    (4)  "Uplift balance" means an amount of money of not more than $2.1 billion that was uplifted to load-serving entities on a load ratio share basis due to energy consumption during the period of emergency for reliability deployment price adder charges and ancillary services costs in excess of the commission's system-wide offer cap, excluding amounts securitized under Subchapter [D](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=41.151), Chapter [41](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=41).  The term does not include amounts that were part of the prevailing settlement point price during the period of emergency.
    
    (5)  "Uplift charges" means charges assessed to load-serving entities to repay amounts financed under this subchapter to pay the uplift balance and reasonable costs incurred by a state agency or the independent organization to implement a debt obligation order under Section [39.653](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.653), [39.654](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.654), or [39.655](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.655), including the cost of retiring or refunding existing debt.

    Sec. 39.653.  DEBT OBLIGATION ORDER.  (a)  The independent organization shall file an application with the commission to establish a debt financing mechanism for the payment of the uplift balance if the commission finds that such financing will support the financial integrity of the wholesale market and is necessary to protect the public interest, considering the impacts on both wholesale market participants and retail customers.
    
    (b)  An order issued under this section must:
    
    (1)  state the uplift balance to be financed;
    
    (2)  state the period over which the uplift charges must be assessed to repay the debt obligations, which may not exceed 30 years; and
    
    (3)  provide the process for remitting the proceeds of the financing to load-serving entities who were exposed to the costs included in the uplift balance, including a requirement for the load-serving entities to submit documentation of their exposure.
    
    (c)  The independent organization shall assess uplift charges to all load-serving entities on a load ratio share basis, which may be translated to a kWh charge, including load serving entities who enter the market after an order has been issued under this subchapter, but excluding the load of entities that opt out under Subsection (d).
    
    (d)  The commission shall develop a one-time process that allows municipally owned utilities, electric cooperatives, river authorities, a retail electric provider that has the same corporate parent as each of the provider's customers, a retail electric provider that is an affiliate of each of the provider's customers, and transmission-voltage customers served by a retail electric provider to opt out of the uplift charges by paying in full all invoices owed for usage during the period of emergency. Load-serving entities and transmission-voltage customers that opt out under this subsection shall not receive any proceeds from the uplift financing.
    
    (e)  An order issued under this section must include a requirement that any load-serving entity that receives proceeds from the financing that exceed the entity's actual exposure to uplift charges from consumption during the period of emergency notify the independent organization and remit any excess receipts.  Any payments received under this subsection must be credited against the uplift balance to reduce the remaining uplift charges.
    
    (f)  Not later than the 90th day after the date the independent organization files an application for an order under Subsection (a), the commission shall issue an order described by Subsection (a) or an order denying the application.  The order becomes effective in accordance with its terms and the order, together with the uplift charges authorized in the order, shall be irrevocable and not subject to reduction, impairment, or adjustment by further action of the commission after it takes effect.  Notwithstanding this requirement, the commission may refinance any debt obligations created by an order under this subchapter if the commission determines that the refinancing is in the public interest and otherwise meets the requirements of this subchapter.
    
    (g)  An order issued under this section is not subject to rehearing by the commission. An order may be reviewed by appeal by a party to the proceeding to a Travis County district court filed not later than the 15th day after the date the order is signed by the commission. The judgment of the district court may be reviewed only by direct appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas filed not later than the 15th day after the date of the entry of judgment. All appeals shall be heard and determined by the district court and the Supreme Court of Texas as expeditiously as possible with lawful precedence over other matters. Review on appeal shall be based solely on the record before the commission and briefs to the court and shall be limited to whether the order conforms to the constitution and laws of this state and the United States and is within the authority of the commission under this chapter.
    
    (h)  A debt obligation issued under this section is a nonrecourse debt secured solely by the uplift charges explicitly assessed to repay the obligation.  The independent organization's obligations authorized under this section do not create personal liability for the independent organization.
    
    (i)  This section does not apply to any balance securitized under Subchapter [D](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=41.151), Chapter [41](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=41).

    (2)  authorize:

    (B)  the acquisition of uplift charge revenue from the independent organization by the contracted state agency, financed:
    
    (i)  by a loan by an issuer to the contracted state agency of the proceeds of debt obligations, net of issuance costs; or
    
    (ii)  by the acquisition by an issuer from the contracted state agency of the uplift charge revenue and in each case the pledge of the revenue to the repayment of the loan or debt obligations, as applicable; and
    
    (3)  authorize the independent organization to serve as collection agent to collect the uplift charges and transfer the collected uplift charges to the contracted state agency or the issuer, as appropriate.
    
    (d)  After issuance of the order, the contracted state agency shall arrange for the issuance of debt obligations, as specified by the order, by the contracted state agency or another issuer selected by the contracted state agency and approved by the commission.

No assets of the state or the independent organization are subject to claims by the holders of the debt obligations.  Following assignment of the uplift charge revenue, the independent organization does not have any beneficial interest or claim of right in the revenue.

    Sec. 39.903.  SYSTEM BENEFIT FUND.  (a)  The system benefit fund is an account in the general revenue fund.  Money in the account may be appropriated only for the purposes provided by this section or other law.  Interest earned on the system benefit fund shall be credited to the fund.  Section [403.095](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=403.095), Government Code, does not apply to the system benefit fund.
    
    (b)  The system benefit fund is financed by a nonbypassable fee set by the commission in an amount not to exceed 65 cents per megawatt hour.  The system benefit fund fee is allocated to customers based on the amount of kilowatt hours used.
    
    (c)  The nonbypassable fee may not be imposed on the retail electric customers of a municipally owned utility or electric cooperative before the sixth month preceding the date on which the utility or cooperative implements customer choice.  Money distributed from the system benefit fund to a municipally owned utility or an electric cooperative shall be proportional to the nonbypassable fee paid by the municipally owned utility or the electric cooperative, subject to the reimbursement provided by Subsection (i).  On request by a municipally owned utility or electric cooperative, the commission shall reduce the nonbypassable fee imposed on retail electric customers served by the municipally owned utility or electric cooperative by an amount equal to the amount provided by the municipally owned utility or electric cooperative or its ratepayers for local low-income programs and local programs that educate customers about the retail electric market in a neutral and nonpromotional manner.
    
    (d)  The commission shall annually review and approve system benefit fund accounts, projected revenue requirements, and proposed nonbypassable fees. 
    
    (e)  Money in the system benefit fund may be appropriated to provide funding solely for the following regulatory purposes, in the following order of priority:
    
    (1)  programs to:
    
    (A)  assist low-income electric customers by providing the 10 percent reduced rate prescribed by Subsection (h); and
    
    (B)  provide one-time bill payment assistance to electric customers who are or who have in their households one or more seriously ill or disabled low-income persons and who have been threatened with disconnection for nonpayment;
    
    (2)  customer education programs, administrative expenses incurred by the commission in implementing and administering this chapter, and expenses incurred by the office under this chapter;
    
    (3)  programs to assist low-income electric customers by providing the targeted energy efficiency programs described by Subsection (f)(2);
    
    (4)  programs to assist low-income electric customers by providing the 20 percent reduced rate prescribed by Subsection (h); and
    
    (5)  reimbursement to the commission and the Health and Human Services Commission for expenses incurred in the implementation and administration of an integrated eligibility process created under Section [17.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=17.007) for customer service discounts relating to retail electric service, including outreach expenses the commission determines are reasonable and necessary.
    
    (f)  Notwithstanding Section [39.106](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.106)(b), the commission shall adopt rules regarding programs to assist low-income electric customers on the introduction of customer choice.  The programs may not be targeted to areas served by municipally owned utilities or electric cooperatives that have not adopted customer choice.  The programs shall include:
    
    (1)  reduced electric rates as provided by Subsections (h)-(l);  and
    
    (2)  targeted energy efficiency programs to be administered by the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs in coordination with existing weatherization programs.
    
    (g)  Until customer choice is introduced in a power region, an electric utility may not reduce, in any manner, programs already offered to assist low-income electric customers.
    
    (h)  The commission shall adopt rules for a retail electric provider to determine a reduced rate for eligible customers to be discounted off the standard retail service package as approved by the commission under Section [39.106](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.106), or the price to beat established by Section [39.202](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.202), whichever is lower.  Municipally owned utilities and electric cooperatives shall establish a reduced rate for eligible customers to be discounted off the standard retail service package established under Section [40.053](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=40.053) or [41.053](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=41.053), as appropriate.  The reduced rate for a retail electric provider shall result in a total charge that is at least 10 percent and, if sufficient money in the system benefit fund is available, up to 20 percent, lower than the amount the customer would otherwise be charged.  To the extent the system benefit fund is insufficient to fund the initial 10 percent rate reduction, the commission may increase the fee to an amount not more than 65 cents per megawatt hour, as provided by Subsection (b).  If the fee is set at 65 cents per megawatt hour or if the commission determines that appropriations are insufficient to fund the 10 percent rate reduction, the commission may reduce the rate reduction to less than 10 percent.  For a municipally owned utility or electric cooperative, the reduced rate shall be equal to an amount that can be fully funded by that portion of the nonbypassable fee proceeds paid by the municipally owned utility or electric cooperative that is allocated to the utility or cooperative by the commission under Subsection (e) for programs for low-income customers of the utility or cooperative.  The reduced rate for municipally owned utilities and electric cooperatives under this section is in addition to any rate reduction that may result from local programs for low-income customers of the municipally owned utilities or electric cooperatives.
    
    (i)  A retail electric provider, municipally owned utility, or electric cooperative seeking reimbursement from the system benefit fund may not charge an eligible low-income customer a rate higher than the appropriate rate determined under Subsection (h).  A retail electric provider not subject to the price to beat, or a municipally owned utility or electric cooperative subject to the nonbypassable fee under Subsection (c), shall be reimbursed from the system benefit fund for the difference between the reduced rate and the rate established under Section [39.106](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.106) or, as appropriate, the rate established under Section [40.053](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=40.053) or [41.053](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=41.053).  A retail electric provider who is subject to the price to beat shall be reimbursed from the system benefit fund for the difference between the reduced rate and the price to beat.  The commission shall adopt rules providing for the reimbursement.
    
    (j)  The commission shall adopt rules providing for methods of enrolling customers eligible to receive reduced rates under Subsection (h).  The rules must provide for automatic enrollment as one enrollment option.  The Texas Department of Human Services, on request of the commission, shall assist in the adoption and implementation of these rules.  The commission and the Texas Department of Human Services shall enter into a memorandum of understanding establishing the respective duties of the commission and the department in relation to the automatic enrollment.
    
    (j-1)  The commission shall adopt rules governing the bill payment assistance program provided under Subsection (e)(1)(B).  The rules must provide that a customer is eligible to receive the assistance only if the assistance is necessary to prevent the disconnection of service for nonpayment of bills and the electric customer is or has in the customer's household one or more seriously ill or disabled low-income persons whose health or safety may be injured by the disconnection.  The commission may prescribe the documentation necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the assistance and may establish additional eligibility criteria.  The Health and Human Services Commission, on request of the commission, shall assist in the adoption and implementation of these rules.
    
    (k)  A retail electric provider is prohibited from charging the customer a fee for participation in the reduced rate program.
    
    (l)  For the purposes of this section, a "low-income electric customer" is an electric customer:
    
    (1)  whose household income is not more than 125 percent of the federal poverty guidelines;  or
    
    (2)  who receives food stamps from the Texas Department of Human Services or medical assistance from a state agency administering a part of the medical assistance program.

    Sec. 39.9044.  GOAL FOR NATURAL GAS.  (a)  It is the intent of the legislature that 50 percent of the megawatts of generating capacity installed in this state after January 1, 2000, use natural gas.  To the extent permitted by law, the commission shall establish a program to encourage utilities to comply with this section by using natural gas produced in this state as the preferential fuel.  This section does not apply to generating capacity for renewable energy technologies.
    
    (b)  The commission shall establish a natural gas energy credits trading program.  Any power generation company, municipally owned utility, or electric cooperative that does not satisfy the requirements of Subsection (a) by directly owning or purchasing capacity using natural gas technologies shall purchase sufficient natural gas energy credits to satisfy the requirements by holding natural gas energy credits in lieu of capacity from natural gas energy technologies.
    
    (c)  Not later than January 1, 2000, the commission shall adopt rules necessary to administer and enforce this section and to perform any necessary studies in cooperation with the Railroad Commission of Texas.  At a minimum, the rules shall:
    
    (1)  establish the minimum annual natural gas generation requirement for each power generation company, municipally owned utility, and electric cooperative operating in this state in a manner reasonably calculated by the commission to produce, on a statewide basis, compliance with the requirement prescribed by Subsection (a);  and
    
    (2)  specify reasonable performance standards that all natural gas capacity additions must meet to count against the requirement prescribed by Subsection (a) and that:
    
    (A)  are designed and operated so as to maximize the energy output from the capacity additions in accordance with then-current industry standards and best industry standards;  and
    
    (B)  encourage the development, construction, and operation of new natural gas energy projects at those sites in this state that have the greatest economic potential for capture and development of this state's environmentally beneficial natural gas resources.
    
    (d)  The commission, with the assistance of the Railroad Commission of Texas, shall adopt rules allowing and encouraging retail electric providers and municipally owned utilities and electric cooperatives that have adopted customer choice to market electricity generated using natural gas produced in this state as environmentally beneficial.  The rules shall allow a provider, municipally owned utility, or cooperative to:
    
    (1)  emphasize that natural gas produced in this state is the cleanest-burning fossil fuel;  and
    
    (2)  label the electricity generated using natural gas produced in this state as "green" electricity.
    
    (e)  In this section, "natural gas technology" means any technology that exclusively relies on natural gas as a primary fuel source.

    Sec. 39.905.  GOAL FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY.  (a)  It is the goal of the legislature that:
    
    (1)  electric utilities will administer energy efficiency incentive programs in a market-neutral, nondiscriminatory manner but will not offer underlying competitive services;
    
    (2)  all customers, in all customer classes, will have a choice of and access to energy efficiency alternatives and other choices from the market that allow each customer to reduce energy consumption, summer and winter peak demand, or energy costs;
    
    (3)  each electric utility annually will provide, through market-based standard offer programs or through targeted market-transformation programs, incentives sufficient for retail electric providers and competitive energy service providers to acquire additional cost-effective energy efficiency, subject to cost ceilings established by the commission, for the utility's residential and commercial customers equivalent to:
    
    (A)  not less than:
    
    (i)  30 percent of the electric utility's annual growth in demand of residential and commercial customers by December 31 of each year beginning with the 2013 calendar year; and
    
    (ii)  the amount of energy efficiency to be acquired for the utility's residential and commercial customers for the most recent preceding year; and
    
    (B)  for an electric utility whose amount of energy efficiency to be acquired under this subsection is equivalent to at least four-tenths of one percent of the electric utility's summer weather-adjusted peak demand for residential and commercial customers in the previous calendar year, not less than:
    
    (i)  four-tenths of one percent of the utility's summer weather-adjusted peak demand for residential and commercial customers by December 31 of each subsequent year; and
    
    (ii)  the amount of energy efficiency to be acquired for the utility's residential and commercial customers for the most recent preceding year;
    
    (4)  each electric utility in the ERCOT region shall use its best efforts to encourage and facilitate the involvement of the region's retail electric providers in the delivery of efficiency programs and demand response programs under this section, including programs for demand-side renewable energy systems that:
    
    (A)  use distributed renewable generation, as defined by Section [39.916](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.916); or
    
    (B)  reduce the need for energy consumption by using a renewable energy technology, a geothermal heat pump, a solar water heater, or another natural mechanism of the environment;
    
    (5)  retail electric providers in the ERCOT region, and electric utilities outside of the ERCOT region, shall provide customers with energy efficiency educational materials; and
    
    (6)  notwithstanding Subsection (a)(3), electric utilities shall continue to make available, at 2007 funding and participation levels, any load management standard offer programs developed for industrial customers and implemented prior to May 1, 2007.
    
    (b)  The commission shall provide oversight and adopt rules and procedures to ensure that the utilities can achieve the goal of this section, including:
    
    (1)  establishing an energy efficiency cost recovery factor for ensuring timely and reasonable cost recovery for utility expenditures made to satisfy the goal of this section;
    
    (2)  establishing an incentive under Section [36.204](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=36.204) to reward utilities administering programs under this section that exceed the minimum goals established by this section;
    
    (3)  providing a utility that is unable to establish an energy efficiency cost recovery factor in a timely manner due to a rate freeze with a mechanism to enable the utility to:
    
    (A)  defer the costs of complying with this section; and
    
    (B)  recover the deferred costs through an energy efficiency cost recovery factor on the expiration of the rate freeze period;
    
    (4)  ensuring that the costs associated with programs provided under this section and any shareholder bonus awarded are borne by the customer classes that receive the services under the programs;
    
    (5)  ensuring the program rules encourage the value of the incentives to be passed on to the end-use customer;
    
    (6)  ensuring that programs are evaluated, measured, and verified using a framework established by the commission that promotes effective program design and consistent and streamlined reporting; and
    
    (7)  ensuring that an independent organization certified under Section [39.151](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.151) allows load participation in all energy markets for residential, commercial, and industrial customer classes, either directly or through aggregators of retail customers, to the extent that load participation by each of those customer classes complies with reasonable requirements adopted by the organization relating to the reliability and adequacy of the regional electric network and in a manner that will increase market efficiency, competition, and customer benefits.
    
    (b-1)  The energy efficiency cost recovery factor under Subsection (b)(1) may not result in an over-recovery of costs but may be adjusted each year to change rates to enable utilities to match revenues against energy efficiency costs and any incentives to which they are granted. The factor shall be adjusted to reflect any over-collection or under-collection of energy efficiency cost recovery revenues in previous years.

    (16)  energy use programs with measurable and verifiable results that reduce energy consumption through behavioral changes that lead to efficient use patterns and practices.
    
    (e)  An electric utility may use money approved by the commission for energy efficiency programs to perform necessary energy efficiency research and development to foster continuous improvement and innovation in the application of energy efficiency technology and energy efficiency program design and implementation.  Money the utility uses under this subsection may not exceed 10 percent of the greater of:
    
    (1)  the amount the commission approved for energy efficiency programs in the utility's most recent full rate proceeding; or
    
    (2)  the commission-approved expenditures by the utility for energy efficiency in the previous year.
    
    (f)  Each unbundled transmission and distribution utility shall include in its energy efficiency plan a targeted low-income energy efficiency program, and the savings achieved by the program shall count toward the transmission and distribution utility's energy efficiency goal.  The commission shall determine the appropriate level of funding to be allocated to both targeted and standard offer low-income energy efficiency programs in each unbundled transmission and distribution utility service area.  The level of funding for low-income energy efficiency programs shall be provided from money approved by the commission for the transmission and distribution utility's energy efficiency programs.  The commission shall ensure that annual expenditures for the targeted low-income energy efficiency programs of each unbundled transmission and distribution utility are not less than 10 percent of the transmission and distribution utility's energy efficiency budget for the year.  A targeted low-income energy efficiency program must comply with the same audit requirements that apply to federal weatherization subrecipients.  In an energy efficiency cost recovery factor proceeding related to expenditures under this subsection, the commission shall make findings of fact regarding whether the utility meets requirements imposed under this subsection.  The state agency that administers the federal weatherization assistance program shall participate in energy efficiency cost recovery factor proceedings related to expenditures under this subsection to ensure that targeted low-income weatherization programs are consistent with federal weatherization programs and adequately funded.
    
    (g)  The commission may provide for a good cause exemption to a utility's liability for an administrative penalty or other sanction if the utility fails to meet a goal for energy efficiency under this section and the utility's failure to meet the goal is caused by one or more factors outside of the utility's control, including:
    
    (1)  insufficient demand by retail electric providers and competitive energy service providers for program incentive funds made available by the utility through its programs;
    
    (2)  changes in building energy codes; and
    
    (3)  changes in government-imposed appliance or equipment efficiency standards.
    
    (h)  For an electric utility operating in an area not open to competition, the utility may achieve the goal of this section by:
    
    (1)  providing rebate or incentive funds directly to customers to promote or facilitate the success of programs implemented under this section; or
    
    (2)  developing, subject to commission approval, new programs other than standard offer programs and market transformation programs, to the extent that the new programs satisfy the same cost-effectiveness requirements as standard offer programs and market transformation programs.
    
    (i)  For an electric utility operating in an area open to competition, on demonstration to the commission, after a contested case hearing, that the requirements under Subsection (a) cannot be met in a rural area through retail electric providers or competitive energy service providers, the utility may achieve the goal of this section by providing rebate or incentive funds directly to customers in the rural area to promote or facilitate the success of programs implemented under this section.
    
    (j)  An electric utility may use energy audit programs to achieve the goal of this section if:
    
    (1)  the programs do not constitute more than three percent of total program costs under this section; and
    
    (2)  the addition of the programs does not cause a utility's portfolio of programs to no longer be cost-effective.
    
    (k)  To help a residential or nongovernmental nonprofit customer make informed decisions regarding energy efficiency, the commission may consider program designs that ensure, to the extent practicable, the customer is provided with information using standardized forms and terms that allow the customer to compare offers for varying degrees of energy efficiency attainable using a measure the customer is considering by cost, estimated energy savings, and payback periods.
