    (1)  in the case of a municipally owned utility, by the municipal governing body or a body vested with the power to manage and operate the municipally owned utility, including procedures providing for rate orders of the governing body having the effect of financing orders, providing for a separate nonbypassable charge approved by the governing body, in the nature of a transition charge, to be collected from all retail electric customers of the municipally owned utility, identified as of a date determined by the governing body, to fund the recovery of the stranded costs of the municipally owned utility and of all reasonable related expenses, as determined by the governing body, and providing for the issuance of bonds, having a term and other characteristics as determined by the governing body, as necessary to recover the amount deemed appropriate by the governing body through securitization financing;  and
    
    (2)  in the case of a river authority, by the commission.
    
    (b)  In order to implement securitization financing under the rules and procedures established by and for a municipally owned utility under Subsection (a)(1), municipalities are expressly authorized and empowered to issue bonds, notes, or other obligations, including refunding bonds, payable from and secured by a lien on and pledge of the revenues collected under an order of the governing body of the municipality, and the bonds shall be issued, without an election or any requirement of giving notice of intent to issue the bonds, by ordinance adopted by the governing body of the municipality, in the form and manner and sold on a negotiated basis or on receipt of bids and on the terms and conditions as shall be determined by the governing body of the municipality.

    Sec. 40.051.  GOVERNING BODY DECISION.  (a)  The municipal governing body or a body vested with the power to manage and operate a municipally owned utility has the discretion to decide when or if the municipally owned utility will provide customer choice.
    
    (b)  Municipally owned utilities may choose to participate in customer choice at any time on or after January 1, 2002, by adoption of an appropriate resolution of the municipal governing body or a body vested with power to manage and operate the municipally owned utility.  The decision to participate in customer choice by the adoption of a resolution is irrevocable.
    
    (c)  After a decision to offer customer choice has been made, Subchapters D and E, Chapter [33](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=33), do not apply to any action taken under this chapter.

    (b)  Notwithstanding Section [39.107](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.107), the metering function may not be deemed a competitive service for customers of the municipally owned utility within that service area and may, at the option of the municipally owned utility, continue to be offered by the municipally owned utility as sole provider.
    
    (c)  On its initiation of customer choice, a municipally owned utility may designate itself or one or more other entities as the provider or providers of last resort for customers within the municipally owned utility's certificated service area as that area existed on the date of the utility's initiation of customer choice.  The municipally owned utility shall fulfill the role of default provider of last resort in the event no other entity is available to act in that capacity if the municipally owned utility continues to sell electric energy to retail customers after the initiation of customer choice.  The municipally owned utility may delegate the authority to designate the provider or providers of last resort to the commission.
    
    (d)  If a customer is unable to obtain service from a retail electric provider or a municipally owned utility or electric cooperative offering customer choice, on request by the customer, the applicable provider of last resort shall offer the customer the standard retail service package for the appropriate customer class, with no interruption of service, at a fixed, nondiscountable rate that is at least sufficient to cover the reasonable costs of providing that service, as approved by the governing body of the municipally owned utility that has the authority to set rates.  If a provider of last resort is designated by the commission, the commission may set the rate each provider of last resort may charge.
    
    (e)  The governing body of a municipally owned utility may establish the procedures and criteria for designating a provider of last resort and may redesignate a provider of last resort according to a schedule it considers appropriate.  If the municipally owned utility delegates authority to the commission under Subsection (c), the commission is not required to comply with procedures or criteria adopted by the municipally owned utility.

    Sec. 40.059.  MUNICIPAL POWER AGENCY;  RECOVERY OF STRANDED COSTS.  (a)  In this section, "member city" means a municipality that participated in the creation of a municipal power agency formed under Chapter [163](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=163) by the adoption of a concurrent resolution by the municipality on or before August 1, 1975.
    
    (b)  After a member city adopts a resolution choosing to participate in customer choice under Section [40.051](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=40.051)(b), a member city may include stranded costs described in Subsection (c) in its distribution costs and may recover those costs through a nonbypassable charge.  The nonbypassable charge shall be as determined by the member city's governing body and may be spread over 16 years.
    
    (c)  The stranded costs that may be recovered under this section are those costs that were determined by the commission and stated in the commission's April 1998 Report to the Texas Senate Interim Committee on Electric Utility Restructuring entitled "Potentially Strandable Investment (ECOM) Report:  1998 Update" and specifically stated in the report at Appendix A (ECOM Estimates Including the Effects of Transition Plans) under the commission base case benchmark base market price for the year 2002.
    
    (d)  The stranded cost amounts described in this section may not be included in the generation costs used in setting rates by the member city's governing body.
    
    (e)  The provisions of this section are cumulative of all other provisions of this chapter, and nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or restrict the application of any provision of this chapter to the member cities.
    
    (f)  The municipal power agency shall extinguish the agency's indebtedness by sale of the electric facility to one or more purchasers, by way of a sale through the issuance of taxable or tax-exempt debt to the member cities, or by any other method.  The agency shall set as an objective the extinguishment of the agency's debt by September 1, 2000.  In the event this objective is not met, the agency shall provide detailed reasons to the electric utility restructuring legislative oversight committee by November 1, 2000, why the agency was not able to meet this objective.
    
    (g)  The municipal power agency or its successor in interest may, at its option, use the rate of return method for calculating its transmission cost of service.  If the rate of return method is used, the return component for the transmission cost of service revenue requirement shall be sufficient to meet the transmission function's pro rata share of levelized debt service and debt service coverage ratio (1.50) and other annual debt obligations;  provided, however, that the total levelized debt service may not exceed the total debt service under the current payment schedule.  Any additional revenue generated by the methodology described in this subsection shall be applied to reduce the agency's outstanding indebtedness.

This subsection does not affect the ability of a municipal governing body or a body vested with the power to manage and operate the municipally owned utility to pass a resolution under Section [40.051](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=40.051)(b).
