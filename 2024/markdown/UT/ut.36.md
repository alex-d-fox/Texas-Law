    Sec. 36.007.  DISCOUNTED WHOLESALE OR RETAIL RATES.  (a)  On application by an electric utility, a regulatory authority may approve wholesale or retail tariffs or contracts containing charges that are less than rates approved by the regulatory authority but not less than the utility's marginal cost.  The charges must be in accordance with the principles of this title and may not be unreasonably preferential, prejudicial, discriminatory, predatory, or anticompetitive.
    
    (b)  The method for computing the marginal cost of the electric utility consists of energy and capacity components.  The energy component includes variable operation and maintenance expense and marginal fuel or the energy component of purchased power.  The capacity component is based on the annual economic value of deferring, accelerating, or avoiding the next increment of needed capacity, without regard to whether the capacity is purchased or built.
    
    (c)  The commission shall ensure that the method for determining marginal cost is consistently applied among utilities but may recognize the individual load and resource requirements of the electric utility.
    
    (d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the commission shall ensure that the electric utility's allocable costs of serving customers paying discounted rates under this section are not borne by the utility's other customers.

    (1)  waive the application of demand ratchet provisions for each nonresidential secondary service customer that has a maximum load factor equal to or below a factor set by commission rule;
    
    (2)  implement procedures to verify annually whether each nonresidential secondary service customer has a maximum load factor that qualifies the customer for the waiver described by Subdivision (1);
    
    (3)  specify in the utility's tariff whether the utility's nonresidential secondary service customers that qualify for the waiver described by Subdivision (1) are to be billed for distribution service charges on the basis of:
    
    (A)  kilowatts;
    
    (B)  kilowatt-hours; or

    (2)  interest expense.
    
    (b)  The regulatory authority may allow a payment described by Subsection (a) only to the extent that the regulatory authority finds the payment is reasonable and necessary for each item or class of items as determined by the commission.
    
    (c)  A finding under Subsection (b) must include:
    
    (1)  a specific finding of the reasonableness and necessity of each item or class of items allowed; and

The income tax expense shall be computed using the statutory income tax rates.
    
    (b)  The amount of income tax that a consolidated group of which an electric utility is a member saves, because the consolidated return eliminates the intercompany profit on purchases by the utility from an affiliate, shall be applied to reduce the cost of the property or service purchased from the affiliate.
    
    (c)  The investment tax credit allowed against federal income taxes, to the extent retained by the electric utility, shall be applied as a reduction in the rate-based contribution of the assets to which the credit applies, to the extent and at the rate allowed by the Internal Revenue Code.

    (1)  the annual amount of pension and other postemployment benefits approved as an expense in the electric utility's last general rate proceeding or, if that amount cannot be determined from the regulatory authority's order, the amount recorded for pension and other postemployment benefits under generally accepted accounting principles during the first year that rates from the electric utility's last general rate proceeding are in effect; and
    
    (2)  the annual amount of pension and other postemployment benefits as determined by actuarial or other similar studies that are chargeable to the electric utility's expense.
    
    (c)  A surplus in the reserve account exists if the amount of pension and other postemployment benefits under Subsection (b)(1) is greater than the amount determined under Subsection (b)(2).  A shortage in the reserve account exists if the amount of pension and other postemployment benefits under Subsection (b)(1) is less than the amount determined under Subsection (b)(2).
    
    (d)  If a reserve account for pension and other postemployment benefits is established, the regulatory authority at a subsequent general rate proceeding shall:
    
    (1)  review the amounts recorded to the reserve account to determine whether the amounts are reasonable expenses;
    
    (2)  determine whether the reserve account has a surplus or shortage under Subsection (c); and
    
    (3)  subtract any surplus from or add any shortage to the electric utility's rate base with the surplus or shortage amortized over a reasonable time.

    Sec. 36.202.  ADJUSTMENT FOR CHANGE IN TAX LIABILITY.  (a)  The commission, on its own motion or on the petition of an electric utility, shall provide for the adjustment of the utility's billing to reflect an increase or decrease in the utility's tax liability to this state if the increase or decrease:
    
    (1)  results from Chapter 5, Acts of the 72nd Legislature, 1st Called Session, 1991;  and
    
    (2)  is attributable to an activity subject to the commission's jurisdiction.
    
    (b)  The commission shall apportion pro rata to each type and class of service provided by the utility any billing adjustment under this section.  The adjustment:
    
    (1)  shall be made effective at the same time as the increase or decrease of tax liability described by Subsection (a)(1) or as soon after that increase or decrease as is reasonably practical;  and
    
    (2)  remains effective only until the commission alters the adjustment as provided by this section or enters an order for the utility under Subchapter C or D.
    
    (c)  Each year after an original adjustment, the commission shall:
    
    (1)  review the utility's increase or decrease of tax liability described by Subsection (a)(1);  and
    
    (2)  alter the adjustment as necessary to reflect the increase or decrease.
    
    (d)  A proceeding under this section is not a rate case under Subchapter C.

    Sec. 36.203.  FUEL AND PURCHASED POWER COST RECOVERY; ADJUSTMENT OF FUEL FACTOR.  (a)  Section [36.201](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=36.201) does not prohibit the commission from reviewing and providing for adjustments of an electric utility's fuel factor.
    
    (b)  The commission by rule shall implement procedures that provide for the timely adjustment of an electric utility's fuel factor.  The rules must require that the findings required by Section [36.058](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=36.058) regarding fuel transactions with affiliated interests be made in a fuel reconciliation proceeding or in a rate case filed under Subchapter C or D.  The rules must ensure that:
    
    (1)  the utility collects as contemporaneously as reasonably possible the electric fuel and purchased power costs that the utility incurs and that the commission determines are eligible;
    
    (2)  the total of the utility's eligible electric fuel and purchased power costs, including any under-collected or over-collected amounts to be recovered through an interim fuel adjustment, is allocated among customer classes based on actual historical calendar month usage;
    
    (3)  any material balance of amounts under-collected or over-collected for eligible electric fuel and purchased power costs is collected from or refunded to customers through an interim fuel adjustment:
    
    (A)  not later than the 90th day after the date the balance is accrued; or
    
    (B)  if the adjustment would result in a total bill increase of 10 percent or more compared to the total bill in the month before implementation, not later than a date ordered by the commission which must be after the 90th day after the date the balance is accrued; and
    
    (4)  an affected party will receive notice and have the opportunity to request a hearing before the commission.
    
    (c)  Notwithstanding Subsection (b)(3), on a finding that an electric utility has an under-collected balance that is the result of extraordinary electric fuel and purchased power costs that are unlikely to continue, the commission may approve an interim fuel adjustment that would defer recovery to take place over a period longer than 90 days.
    
    (d)  The commission is not required to hold a hearing on the adjustment of an electric utility's fuel factor under this section.  If the commission holds a hearing, the commission may consider at the hearing any evidence that is appropriate and in the public interest.
    
    (e)  A customer of the electric utility, a municipality with original jurisdiction over the utility, or the office may protest a fuel factor or interim fuel adjustment proposed under this section.  The prudence of costs may not be considered in a fuel factor or interim fuel adjustment proceeding and may only be considered in a fuel reconciliation proceeding under Subsection (h) or another appropriate proceeding.
    
    (f)  The sole issue that may be considered on a protest of a fuel factor under Subsection (e) is whether the factor reasonably reflects costs the electric utility will incur so that the utility will not substantially under-collect or over-collect the utility's reasonably stated fuel and purchased power costs on an ongoing basis.  The commission may adjust the utility's fuel factor based on its determination on that issue.
    
    (g)  The commission shall hold a hearing on a protest of an interim fuel adjustment under Subsection (e) if the adjustment would result in a total bill increase of 10 percent or more as described by Subsection (b)(3) or if the adjustment results from extraordinary electric fuel and purchased power costs as described by Subsection (c).  In response to a protest of an interim fuel adjustment, if the commission finds that the electric utility is in a state of material under-collection or over-collection of the utility's reasonably stated eligible fuel and purchased power costs and is projected to remain in that state on an ongoing basis, the commission shall order the utility to establish or modify an interim fuel adjustment to address the under-collection or over-collection in a manner consistent with this section.
    
    (h)  An electric utility shall apply to reconcile the utility's electric fuel and purchased power costs at least once every two years.  The application must be made not later than the 180th day after the last day of the period to be reconciled.  The commission may by rule establish the calendar year timing of the reconciliation period for each electric utility subject to this section to facilitate efficient work by the commission.  To the extent a reconciliation results in a change to the electric utility's under-collected or over-collected fuel balance, that change may be incorporated into an interim fuel adjustment as directed by the commission.
    
    (i)  A proceeding under this section is not a rate case under Subchapter C.

    Sec. 36.205.  PURCHASED POWER COST RECOVERY.  (a)  This section applies only to an increase or decrease in the cost of purchased electricity that has been:
    
    (1)  accepted by a federal regulatory authority;  or
    
    (2)  approved after a hearing by the commission.
    
    (b)  The commission may use any appropriate method to provide for the adjustment of the cost of purchased electricity on terms determined by the commission.
    
    (c)  Purchased electricity costs may be recovered:
    
    (1)  concurrently with the effective date of the changed costs to the purchasing electric utility;  or
    
    (2)  as soon after the effective date as reasonably practical.
    
    (d)  The commission may provide a mechanism to allow an electric utility that has a noncontiguous geographical service area and that purchases power for resale for that noncontiguous service area from electric utilities that are not members of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas to recover purchased power costs for the area in a manner that reflects the purchased power cost for that specific geographical noncontiguous area.  The commission may not require an electric cooperative corporation to use the mechanism provided under this section unless the electric cooperative corporation requests its use.
    
    (e)  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), an electric utility may apply to the commission for review and approval of an agreement between the electric utility and another person for the purchase of power by the electric utility if approval by the commission is a pre-condition to the effectiveness of the electric utility's right or obligation to purchase power under the agreement.  This subsection applies only to an agreement with a term of three years or more.  The commission by rule shall implement this subsection consistent with the standards and procedures in the commission's rules governing contested cases on certificates of convenience and necessity for generating facilities adopted under Sections [37.056](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=37.056) and [37.058](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=37.058).

    (1)  the cost the electric utility incurs in purchasing capacity and energy;
    
    (2)  a mark-up added to the cost or another mechanism the commission determines will reasonably compensate the utility for any financial risk associated with purchased power obligations;  and
    
    (3)  the value added by the utility in making the purchased power available to customers.
    
    (b)  The mark-ups and cost recovery factors, if allowed, may be those necessary to encourage the electric utility to include economical purchased power as part of the utility's energy and capacity resource supply plan.

    Sec. 36.210.  PERIODIC RATE ADJUSTMENTS.  (a)  The commission, on the petition of an electric utility, may approve a tariff or rate schedule in which a nonfuel rate may be periodically adjusted upward or downward, based on changes in the parts of the utility's invested capital, as described by Section [36.053](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=36.053), that are categorized or functionalized as distribution plant, distribution-related intangible plant, and distribution-related communication equipment and networks in accordance with commission rules adopted after consideration of the uniform system of accounts prescribed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  A periodic rate adjustment must:
    
    (1)  be approved or denied in accordance with a procedure that allows for participation by the office and affected parties;
    
    (2)  take into account changes in the number of an electric utility's customers and the effects, on a weather-normalized basis, that energy consumption and energy demand have on the amount of revenue recovered through the electric utility's base rates;
    
    (3)  be consistent with the manner in which costs for invested capital described by this subsection were allocated to each rate class, as approved by the commission, in an electric utility's most recent base rate statement of intent proceeding with changes to residential and commercial class rates reflected in volumetric charges to the extent that residential and commercial class rates are collected in that manner based on the electric utility's most recent base rate statement of intent proceeding;
    
    (4)  not diminish the ability of the commission or a regulatory authority, on its own motion or on complaint by an affected person as provided by Subchapter D, after reasonable notice and hearing, to change the existing rates of an electric utility for a service after finding that the rates are unreasonable or in violation of law;
    
    (5)  be applied by an electric utility on a system-wide basis; and
    
    (6)  be supported by the sworn statement of an appropriate employee of the electric utility that affirms that:
    
    (A)  the filing is in compliance with the provisions of the tariff or rate schedule; and
    
    (B)  the filing is true and correct to the best of the employee's knowledge, information, and belief.
    
    (b)  An electric utility in the ERCOT power region, or an unbundled electric utility outside the ERCOT power region in whose service area retail competition is available, that requests a periodic rate adjustment under this section shall:
    
    (1)  except as provided by Subsection (f)(3) and to the extent possible, implement simultaneously all nonfuel rates to be adjusted in a 12-month period that are charged by the utility to retail electric providers; and
    
    (2)  provide notice to retail electric providers of the approved rates not later than the 45th day before the date the rates take effect.
    
    (c)  A periodic rate adjustment approved under this section may not be used to adjust the portion of a nonfuel rate relating to the generation of electricity.
    
    (d)  An electric utility may adjust the utility's rates under this section not more than twice per year.

    (1)  conflict with a provision contained in a financing order issued under Subchapter I of this chapter or Subchapter G or J, Chapter [39](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39);
    
    (2)  affect the limitation on the commission's jurisdiction under Section [32.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=32.002);
    
    (3)  include in a periodic rate adjustment authorized by this section costs adjusted under a transmission cost-of-service adjustment approved under Section [35.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=35.004)(d);
    
    (4)  limit the jurisdiction of a municipality over the rates, operations, and services of an electric utility as provided by Section [33.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=33.001);
    
    (5)  limit the ability of a municipality to obtain a reimbursement under Section [33.023](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=33.023) for the reasonable cost of services of a person engaged in an activity described by that section; or
    
    (6)  prevent the commission from:
    
    (A)  reviewing the investment costs included in a periodic rate adjustment or in the following comprehensive base rate proceeding to determine whether the costs were prudent, reasonable, and necessary; or
    
    (B)  refunding to customers any amount improperly recovered through the periodic rate adjustments, with appropriate carrying costs.
    
    (g)  The commission shall adopt rules necessary to implement this section.  The rules must provide for:
    
    (1)  a procedure by which a tariff or rate schedule is to be reviewed and approved;
    
    (2)  filing requirements and discovery consistent with Subsection (a);
    
    (3)  an earnings monitoring report that allows the commission to reasonably determine whether a utility is earning in excess of the utility's allowed return on investment as normalized for weather;
    
    (4)  denial of the electric utility's filing if the electric utility is earning more than the utility's authorized rate of return on investment, on a weather-normalized basis, at the time the periodic rate adjustment request is filed; and
    
    (5)  a mechanism by which the commission may refund customers any amounts determined to be improperly recovered through a periodic rate adjustment, including any interest on the amounts.
    
    (h)  An electric utility may file a request for a periodic rate adjustment under this section on any day on which the commission is open for business, except that if the utility has a base rate proceeding pending, the utility may not file the request before the 185th day after the date the base rate proceeding was initiated.  The electric utility may revise a request to reflect the final order issued in the base rate proceeding.  The fact that an electric utility has a base rate proceeding pending during a proceeding conducted under this section does not establish grounds for dismissal of either proceeding.

    Sec. 36.215.  RECOVERY OF INVESTMENT IN DISTRIBUTED GENERATION AND RATES FOR BACKUP ELECTRIC SERVICE FOR CERTAIN NON-ERCOT UTILITIES.  (a)  In this section:
    
    (1)  "Customer-sited distributed generation facility" means a dispatchable generation facility that is installed on the electric utility's side of the retail meter and owned and operated by the electric utility:
    
    (A)  with a nameplate capacity of not more than 10 megawatts;
    
    (B)  that is capable of generating and providing backup electric service to a customer during a power grid outage; and
    
    (C)  sited at or adjacent to the customer's premises.
    
    (2)  "Host customer" means a customer receiving backup electric service under this section.
    
    (b)  This section applies only to an electric utility that operates solely outside of ERCOT in areas of this state included in the Southeastern Electric Reliability Council.
    
    (c)  An electric utility may provide backup electric service to a nonresidential retail customer through a customer-sited distributed generation facility.
    
    (d)  The commission, on the petition of an electric utility, shall establish just and reasonable rates for backup electric service supplied using a customer-sited distributed generation facility, consistent with this chapter, provided that costs are allocated as follows:
    
    (1)  if the facility is capable of directly supplying energy to the distribution system or of disconnecting the host customer from the distribution system when not being used to supply backup electric service to the host customer and thereby reducing system load, the commission shall allocate the cost of owning and operating the facility between the host customer and the electric utility's broader customer base, including an allocation of any margins from energy sales attributable to the facility to the host customer in reasonable proportion to the allocation of nonfuel costs as provided by Subdivision (2); and
    
    (2)  the allocation of nonfuel costs to the host customer must be based on the cost to purchase, install, interconnect, own, operate, and maintain the facility that is above the electric utility's levelized avoided cost to install, own, operate, and maintain a single-cycle combustion turbine, on a per kilowatt basis, grossed up for avoided line losses based on the utility's transmission and distribution line loss factors last approved by the commission.
    
    (e)  In a rate proceeding in which an electric utility seeks to recover the utility's investment in a customer-sited distributed generation facility that is interconnected to the utility's distribution system:
    
    (1)  the full cost of the utility's investment is eligible for recovery; and
    
    (2)  the cost of the facility and backup electric service revenues must be allocated among customer classes on the same basis used to allocate the utility's distribution-level investments.

    Sec. 36.351.  DISCOUNTED RATES FOR CERTAIN INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION.  (a)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, each electric utility and municipally owned utility shall discount charges for electric service provided to a facility of a four-year state university, upper-level institution, Texas State Technical College, or college.
    
    (b)  The discount is a 20-percent reduction of the utility's base rates that would otherwise be paid under the applicable tariffed rate.
    
    (c)  An electric or municipally owned utility is exempt from this section if the 20-percent discount results in a reduction equal to more than one percent of the utility's total annual revenues.
    
    (d)  A municipally owned utility is exempt from this section if the municipally owned utility, on September 1, 1995, discounted base commercial rates for electric service provided to all four-year state universities or colleges in its service area by 20 percent or more.
    
    (e)  This section does not apply to a rate charged to an institution of higher education by a municipally owned utility that provides a discounted rate to the state for electric services below rates in effect on January 1, 1995, if the discounted rate provides a greater financial discount to the state than is provided to the institution of higher education through the discount provided by this section.
    
    (f)  An investor-owned electric utility may not recover from residential customers or any other customer class the assigned and allocated costs of serving a state university or college that receives a discount under this section.
    
    (g)  Each electric utility shall file tariffs with the commission reflecting the discount required under this section.  The initial tariff filing is not a rate change for purposes of Subchapter C.

    (b)  The discount under Subsection (a) is a 20 percent reduction of the base commercial rate that the municipally owned utility, electric cooperative, or electric utility would otherwise charge the military installation.
    
    (c)  An electric utility, municipally owned utility, or electric cooperative may assess a surcharge to all of the utility's retail customers in the state to recover the difference in revenue between the revenues from the discounted rate for military bases provided under Subsection (a) and the base commercial rate.  This subsection does not apply to an electric utility, municipally owned utility, or electric cooperative that was providing electric service to a military base on December 31, 2002, at a rate constituting a discount of 20 percent or more from the utility's base commercial rate that the utility would otherwise charge the military base.
    
    (d)  Each electric utility shall file a tariff with the commission reflecting the discount required by Subsection (a) and may file a tariff reflecting the surcharge provided by Subsection (c).  Not later than the 30th day after the date the commission receives the electric utility's tariff reflecting the surcharge, the commission shall approve the tariff.  A proceeding under this subsection is not a rate change for purposes of Subchapter C.
    
    (e)  An electric utility, municipally owned utility, or electric cooperative is exempt from the requirements of Subsection (a) if:
    
    (1)  the 20 percent discount would result in a reduction of revenue in an amount that is greater than one percent of the utility's total annual revenues;  or
    
    (2)  the utility:
    
    (A)  was providing electric service to a military base on December 31, 2002, at a rate constituting a discount of 20 percent or more from the utility's base commercial rate that the utility would otherwise charge the military base;  and
    
    (B)  continues to provide electric service to the military base at a rate constituting a discount of 20 percent or more from the utility's base commercial rate that the utility would otherwise charge the military base.
    
    (f)  Each electric utility shall provide the Texas Military Preparedness Commission with the base commercial rate that the utility would otherwise charge the military base and the rate the utility is charging the military base.

    RESTORATION COSTS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 36.401.  SECURITIZATION FOR RECOVERY OF SYSTEM RESTORATION COSTS; PURPOSE.  (a)  The purpose of this subchapter is to enable an electric utility to obtain timely recovery of system restoration costs and to use securitization financing to recover these costs, because that type of debt will lower the carrying costs associated with the recovery of these costs, relative to the costs that would be incurred using conventional financing methods.  The proceeds of the transition bonds may be used only for the purposes of reducing the amount of recoverable system restoration costs, as determined by the commission in accordance with this subchapter, including the refinancing or retirement of utility debt or equity.
    
    (b)  It is the intent of the legislature that:
    
    (1)  securitization of system restoration costs will be accomplished using the same procedures, standards, and protections for securitization authorized under Subchapter [G](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.301), Chapter [39](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39), as in effect on the effective date of this section, except as provided by this subchapter; and
    
    (2)  the commission will ensure that securitization of system restoration costs provides greater tangible and quantifiable benefits to ratepayers than would have been achieved without the issuance of transition bonds.

    Sec. 36.402.  SYSTEM RESTORATION COSTS; STANDARDS AND DEFINITIONS.  (a)  In this subchapter, "system restoration costs" means reasonable and necessary costs, including costs expensed, charged to self-insurance reserves, deferred, capitalized, or otherwise financed, that are incurred by an electric utility due to any activity or activities conducted by or on behalf of the electric utility in connection with the restoration of service and infrastructure associated with electric power outages affecting customers of the electric utility as the result of any tropical storm or hurricane, ice or snow storm, flood, or other weather-related event or natural disaster that occurred in calendar year 2008 or thereafter. System restoration costs include mobilization, staging, and construction, reconstruction, replacement, or repair of electric generation, transmission, distribution, or general plant facilities. System restoration costs shall include reasonable estimates of the costs of an activity or activities conducted or expected to be conducted by or on behalf of the electric utility in connection with the restoration of service or infrastructure associated with electric power outages, but such estimates shall be subject to true-up and reconciliation after the actual costs are known. System restoration costs include reasonable and necessary weatherization and storm-hardening costs incurred, as well as reasonable estimates of costs to be incurred, by the electric utility, but such estimates shall be subject to true-up and reconciliation after the actual costs are known.
    
    (b)  System restoration costs shall include carrying costs at the electric utility's weighted average cost of capital as last approved by the commission in a general rate proceeding from the date on which the system restoration costs were incurred until the date that transition bonds are issued or until system restoration costs are otherwise recovered pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter.
    
    (c)  To the extent a utility subject to this subchapter receives insurance proceeds, governmental grants, or any other source of funding that compensate it for system restoration costs, those amounts shall be used to reduce the utility's system restoration costs recoverable from customers.  If the timing of a utility's receipt of those amounts prevents their inclusion as a reduction to the system restoration costs that are securitized, or the commission later determines as a result of the true-up and reconciliation provided for in Subsection (a) that the actual costs incurred are less than estimated costs included in the determination of system restoration costs, the commission shall take those amounts into account in:
    
    (1)  the utility's next base rate proceeding; or
    
    (2)  any subsequent proceeding, other than a true-up proceeding under Section [39.307](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.307), in which the commission considers system restoration costs.
    
    (d)  If the commission determines that the insurance proceeds, governmental grants, or other sources of funding that compensate the electric utility for system restoration costs, or the amount resulting from a true-up of estimated system restoration costs are of a magnitude to justify a separate tariff rider, the commission may establish a tariff rider to credit such amounts against charges, other than transition charges or system restoration charges as defined in Section [36.403](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=36.403), being collected from customers.
    
    (e)  To the extent that the electric utility receives insurance proceeds, governmental grants, or any other source of funding that is used to reduce system restoration costs, the commission shall impute interest on those amounts at the same cost of capital included in the utility's system restoration costs until the date that those amounts are used to reduce the amount of system restoration costs that are securitized or otherwise reflected in the rates of the utility.

    (d)  For purposes of this subchapter, "qualified costs," as defined by Section [39.302](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.302) and as used in Subchapter [G](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.301), Chapter [39](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39), includes 100 percent of the electric utility's system restoration costs, net of any insurance proceeds, governmental grants, or other source of funding that compensate the utility for system restoration costs, received by the utility at the time it files an application for a financing order.  Qualified costs also include the costs of issuing, supporting, and servicing transition bonds and any costs of retiring and refunding existing debt and equity securities of an electric utility subject to this subchapter in connection with the issuance of transition bonds.  For purposes of this subchapter, the term qualified costs also includes:
    
    (1)  the costs to the commission of acquiring professional services for the purpose of evaluating proposed transactions under this subchapter; and
    
    (2)  costs associated with ancillary agreements such as any bond insurance policy, letter of credit, reserve account, surety bond, swap arrangement, hedging arrangement, liquidity or credit support arrangement, or other financial arrangement entered into in connection with the issuance or payment of transition bonds.
    
    (e)  For purposes of this subchapter, "transition bonds," as defined by Section [39.302](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.302) and as used in Subchapter [G](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.301), Chapter [39](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39), includes transition bonds issued in association with the recovery of system restoration costs.  Transition bonds issued to securitize system restoration costs may be called "system restoration bonds" or may be called by any other name acceptable to the issuer and the underwriters of the transition bonds.
    
    (f)  For purposes of this subchapter, "transition charges," as defined by Section [39.302](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.302) and as used in Subchapter [G](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.301), Chapter [39](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39), includes nonbypassable amounts to be charged for the use of electric services, approved by the commission under a financing order to recover system restoration costs, that shall be collected by an electric utility, its successors, an assignee, or other collection agents as provided for in the financing order.  Transition charges approved by the commission under a financing order to recover system restoration costs may be called "system restoration charges" or may be called by any other name acceptable to the issuer and the underwriters of the transition bonds.
    
    (g)  Notwithstanding Section [39.303](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.303)(c), system restoration costs shall be functionalized and allocated to customers in the same manner as the corresponding facilities and related expenses are functionalized and allocated in the electric utility's current base rates.  For an electric utility operating within the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, system restoration costs that are properly includable in the transmission cost of service mechanism adopted under Section [35.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=35.004) and associated deferred costs not included under Section [35.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=35.004) shall be recovered under the method of pricing provided for in that section and commission rules promulgated under that section; provided, however, that an electric utility operating under a rate freeze or other limitation on its ability to pass through wholesale costs to its customers may defer such costs and accrue carrying costs at its weighted average cost of capital as last approved by the commission in a general rate proceeding until such time as the freeze or limitation expires.
    
    (h)  The amount of any accumulated deferred federal income taxes offset, used to determine the securitization total, may not be considered in future rate proceedings.  Any tax obligation of the electric utility arising from its receipt of securitization bond proceeds, or from the collection and remittance of transition charges, shall be recovered by the electric utility through the commission's implementation of this subchapter.
    
    (i)  Notwithstanding a rate freeze or limitations on an electric utility's ability to change rates authorized or imposed by any other provision of this title or by a regulatory authority, an electric utility is entitled to recover system restoration costs consistent with the provisions of this subchapter.
    
    (j)  If in the course of a proceeding to adopt a financing order the commission determines that the recovery of all or any portion of an electric utility's system restoration costs, using securitization, is not beneficial to ratepayers of the electric utility, under one or more of the tests applied to determine those benefits, the commission shall nonetheless use the proceeding to issue an order permitting the electric utility to recover the remainder of its system restoration costs through an appropriate customer surcharge mechanism, including carrying costs at the electric utility's weighted average cost of capital as last approved by the commission in a general rate proceeding, to the extent that the electric utility has not securitized those costs.  A rate proceeding under Subchapter C or D shall not be required to determine and implement this surcharge mechanism.  On the final implementation of rates resulting from the filing of a rate proceeding under Subchapter C or D that provides for the recovery of all remaining system restoration costs, a rider or surcharge mechanism adopted under this subsection shall expire.  This subsection is limited to instances in which an electric utility has incurred system restoration costs of $100 million or more in any calendar year after January 1, 2008.

    Sec. 36.405.  DETERMINATION OF SYSTEM RESTORATION COSTS.  (a)  An electric utility is entitled to recover system restoration costs consistent with the provisions of this subchapter and is entitled to seek recovery of amounts not recovered under this subchapter, including system restoration costs not yet incurred at the time an application is filed under Subsection (b), in its next base rate proceeding or through any other proceeding authorized by Subchapter C or D.
    
    (b)  An electric utility may file an application with the commission seeking a determination of the amount of system restoration costs eligible for recovery and securitization.  The commission may by rule prescribe the form of the application and the information reasonably needed to support the application; provided, however, that if such a rule is not in effect, the electric utility shall not be precluded from filing its application and such application cannot be rejected as being incomplete.
    
    (c)  The commission shall issue an order determining the amount of system restoration costs eligible for recovery and securitization not later than the 150th day after the date an electric utility files its application.  The 150-day period begins on the date the electric utility files the application, even if the filing occurs before the effective date of this section.
    
    (d)  An electric utility may file an application for a financing order prior to the expiration of the 150-day period provided for in Subsection (c).  The commission shall issue a financing order not later than 90 days after the utility files its request for a financing order; provided, however, that the commission need not issue the financing order until it has determined the amount of system restoration costs eligible for recovery and securitization.
    
    (e)  To the extent the commission has made a determination of the eligible system restoration costs of an electric utility before the effective date of this section, that determination may provide the basis for the utility's application for a financing order pursuant to this subchapter and Subchapter [G](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.301), Chapter [39](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39).  A previous commission determination does not preclude the utility from requesting recovery of additional system restoration costs eligible for recovery under this subchapter, but not previously authorized by the commission.
    
    (f)  A rate proceeding under Subchapter C or D shall not be required to determine the amount of recoverable system restoration costs, as provided by this section, or for the issuance of a financing order.
    
    (g)  A commission order under this subchapter is not subject to rehearing.  A commission order may be reviewed by appeal only to a Travis County district court by a party to the proceeding filed within 15 days after the order is signed by the commission.  The judgment of the district court may be reviewed only by direct appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas filed within 15 days after entry of judgment.  All appeals shall be heard and determined by the district court and the Supreme Court of Texas as expeditiously as possible with lawful precedence over other matters.  Review on appeal shall be based solely on the record before the commission and briefs to the court and shall be limited to whether the order conforms to the constitution and laws of this state and the United States and is within the authority of the commission under this chapter.

    SUBCHAPTER J. LOWER-COST FINANCING MECHANISM FOR SECURITIZATION FOR RECOVERY OF SYSTEM RESTORATION COSTS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 36.451.  PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY.  (a) Except as otherwise specifically provided by this subchapter, the same procedures, standards, and protections for securitization authorized by Subchapter I of this chapter and, to the extent made applicable to Subchapter I of this chapter, by Subchapter [G](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.301), Chapter [39](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39), apply to the lower-cost financing mechanism for securitization of transition costs or system restoration costs as provided by Subchapter I. To the extent of any conflict between the provisions of this subchapter and Subchapter I of this chapter or, to the extent made applicable by Subchapter I of this chapter, Subchapter [G](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.301), Chapter [39](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39), in cases involving the securitization of system restoration costs under this subchapter, the provisions of this subchapter control.
    
    (b)  The purpose of this subchapter is to make available a lower-cost, supplemental financing mechanism to allow an electric utility operating solely outside of ERCOT to obtain timely recovery of system restoration costs under Subchapter I through securitization and the issuance of transition bonds or system restoration bonds by an issuer other than the electric utility or an affiliated special purpose entity. Financing of system restoration costs under this subchapter is a valid and essential public purpose.
    
    (c)  The Texas Electric Utility System Restoration Corporation is created under this subchapter as a special purpose public corporation and instrumentality of the state for the essential public purpose of providing a lower-cost, supplemental financing mechanism available to the commission and an electric utility to attract low-cost capital to finance system restoration costs.
    
    (d)  In approving securitization under this subchapter, the commission shall ensure that customers are not harmed as a result of any financing through the Texas Electric Utility System Restoration Corporation and that any financial savings or other benefits are appropriately reflected in customer rates.
    
    (e)  System restoration bonds issued under this subchapter will be solely the obligation of the issuer and the corporation as borrower, if applicable, and will not be a debt of or a pledge of the faith and credit of the state.
    
    (f)  System restoration bonds issued under this subchapter shall be nonrecourse to the credit or any assets of the state and the commission.
    
    (g)  This subchapter does not limit or impair the commission's jurisdiction under this title to regulate the rates charged and the services rendered by electric utilities in this state.
    
    (h)  An electric utility receiving the proceeds of securitization financing under this subchapter is not required to provide utility services to the corporation or the state as a result of receiving such proceeds except in the role of the corporation or the state as a customer of the electric utility. This subchapter does not create an obligation of the corporation or an issuer to provide electric services to the electric utility or its customers.

In the event of any rehabilitation, liquidation, or dissolution, the assets of the corporation must be applied first to pay all debts, liabilities, and obligations of the corporation, including the establishment of reasonable reserves for any contingent liabilities or obligations, and all remaining funds of the corporation must be applied and distributed as provided by an order of the commission.
    
    (f)  Before the date that is two years and one day after the date that the corporation no longer has any payment obligation with respect to any system restoration bonds, including any obligation to an issuer of any system restoration bonds outstanding, the corporation may not file a voluntary petition under federal bankruptcy law and neither any public official nor any organization, entity, or other person may authorize the corporation to be or to become a debtor under federal bankruptcy law during that period.
