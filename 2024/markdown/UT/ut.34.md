    (h)  For money deposited under Subsection (g) for a loan for the construction of a new facility, the commission:
    
    (1)  shall authorize the loan recipient to withdraw the deposit from the escrow account if the facility for which the loan was provided is interconnected in the ERCOT power region before the fourth anniversary of the date the initial loan funds were disbursed; or

    (i)  The commission by rule shall establish performance standards for grant recipients based on reliability metrics, appropriate for the types of facilities for which grants may be provided, for performance during the 100 hours with the least quantity of operating reserves for each year. The commission may not disburse a grant recipient's annual payment under Subsection (h) if the performance of the facility for which the grant was provided is equal to or below the median performance standard established under this subsection during a test period designated by the commission for that year. The commission may disburse a discounted amount of a grant recipient's annual payment under Subsection (h) if the performance of the facility for which the grant was provided is above the median performance standard established under this subsection during a test period designated by the commission for that year but less than an optimal performance standard established by the commission.
