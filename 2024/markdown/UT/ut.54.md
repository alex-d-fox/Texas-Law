(a)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, if a telecommunications utility installs facilities to serve customers located in a defined geographic area to provide telecommunications services, including basic local telecommunications service, before the holder of the certificate of convenience and necessity installs facilities to serve customers located in that defined geographic area, the holder of the certificate of convenience and necessity may petition the commission for an order relieving the utility of the utility's designation as the provider of last resort in that defined geographic area.

    (2)  another certificated telecommunications utility has installed facilities adequate to provide that service throughout that area;  and
