    SUBTITLE A. GAS UTILITY REGULATORY ACT
    
      
    
    
    CHAPTER 104. RATES AND SERVICES
    
      
    
    
    SUBCHAPTER A. GENERAL PROVISIONS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 104.001.  AUTHORIZATION TO ESTABLISH AND REGULATE RATES.  (a)  The railroad commission is vested with all the authority and power of this state to ensure compliance with the obligations of gas utilities in this subtitle.
    
    (b)  The regulatory authority may establish and regulate rates of a gas utility and may adopt rules for determining:
    
    (1)  the classification of customers and services;  and
    
    (2)  the applicability of rates.
    
    (c)  A rule or order of the regulatory authority may not conflict with a ruling of a federal regulatory body.
    
    
    
    
    Acts 1997, 75th Leg., ch. 166, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1997.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 104.002.  COMPLIANCE WITH SUBTITLE.  A gas utility may not:
    
    (1)  charge, collect, or receive a rate for utility service except as provided by this subtitle;  or
    
    (2)  impose a rule or regulation except as provided by this subtitle.
    
    
    
    
    Acts 1997, 75th Leg., ch. 166, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1997.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 104.003.  JUST AND REASONABLE RATES.  (a)  The regulatory authority shall ensure that each rate a gas utility or two or more gas utilities jointly make, demand, or receive is just and reasonable.  A rate may not be unreasonably preferential, prejudicial, or discriminatory but must be sufficient, equitable, and consistent in application to each class of consumer.  In establishing a gas utility's rates, the railroad commission may treat as a single class two or more municipalities that a gas utility serves if the commission considers that treatment to be appropriate.
    
    (b)  A rate for a pipeline-to-pipeline transaction or to a transportation, industrial, or similar large volume contract customer is considered to be just and reasonable and otherwise to comply with this section and shall be approved by the regulatory authority if:
    
    (1)  neither the gas utility nor the customer had an unfair advantage during the negotiations;
    
    (2)  the rate is substantially the same as the rate between the gas utility and at least two of those customers under the same or similar conditions of service;  or
    
    (3)  competition does or did exist with another gas utility, another supplier of natural gas, or a supplier of an alternative form of energy.
    
    (c)  Subsection (b) does not apply:
    
    (1)  if a complaint is filed with the railroad commission by a transmission pipeline purchaser of gas sold or transported under the pipeline-to-pipeline or transportation rate;  or
    
    (2)  to a direct sale for resale to a gas distribution utility at a city gate.
    
    (d)  The reasonableness of gas purchase costs included in a city gate rate proposed to be charged for a sale for resale to a gas distribution utility at a city gate may be reviewed at a city gate rate proceeding even though the costs have been previously approved as a rate for other parties under Subsection (b).
    
    (e)  Subsection (b)(1) does not apply to a rate charged or offered to be charged to an affiliated pipeline utility.

    Sec. 104.004.  UNREASONABLE PREFERENCE OR PREJUDICE PROHIBITED.  A gas utility may not:
    
    (1)  grant an unreasonable preference or advantage concerning rates or services to a person in a classification;
    
    (2)  subject a person in a classification to an unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage concerning rates or services;  or
    
    (3)  establish or maintain an unreasonable difference concerning rates of services between localities or between classes of service.

    Sec. 104.005.  EQUALITY OF RATES AND SERVICES.  (a)  A gas utility may not directly or indirectly charge, demand, collect, or receive from a person a greater or lesser compensation for a service provided or to be provided by the utility than the compensation prescribed by the applicable schedule of rates filed under Section [102.151](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=102.151).
    
    (b)  A person may not knowingly receive or accept a service from a gas utility for a compensation greater or less than the compensation prescribed by the schedules.  A rate charged and collected by a gas utility on September 1, 1983, may be continued until schedules are filed.
    
    (c)  After notice and hearing, the railroad commission may, in the public interest, order a gas utility to refund with interest compensation received in violation of this section.
    
    (d)  This subtitle does not prevent a cooperative corporation from returning to its members net earnings resulting from its operations in proportion to the members' purchases from or through the corporation.

    Sec. 104.006.  RATES FOR AREA NOT IN MUNICIPALITY.  Without the approval of the railroad commission, a gas utility's rates for an area not in a municipality may not exceed 115 percent of the average of all rates for similar services for all municipalities served by the same utility in the same county as that area.

    Sec. 104.007.  DISCRIMINATION AND RESTRICTION ON COMPETITION.  A gas utility may not:
    
    (1)  discriminate against a person who sells or leases equipment or performs services in competition with the gas utility;  or
    
    (2)  engage in a practice that tends to restrict or impair that competition.
    
    
    
    
    Acts 1997, 75th Leg., ch. 166, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1997.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 104.008.  BURDEN OF PROOF.  In a proceeding involving a proposed rate change, the gas utility has the burden of proving that:
    
    (1)  the rate change is just and reasonable, if the utility proposes the change;  or
    
    (2)  an existing rate is just and reasonable, if the proposal is to reduce the rate.

    SUBCHAPTER B. COMPUTATION OF RATES
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 104.051.  ESTABLISHING OVERALL REVENUES.  In establishing a gas utility's rates, the regulatory authority shall establish the utility's overall revenues at an amount that will permit the utility a reasonable opportunity to earn a reasonable return on the utility's invested capital used and useful in providing service to the public in excess of its reasonable and necessary operating expenses.
    
    
    
    
    Acts 1997, 75th Leg., ch. 166, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1997.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 104.052.  ESTABLISHING FAIR RATE OF RETURN.  The regulatory authority may not establish a rate that yields more than a fair return on the adjusted value of the invested capital used and useful in providing service to the public.
    
    
    
    
    Acts 1997, 75th Leg., ch. 166, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1997.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 104.053.  COMPONENTS OF ADJUSTED VALUE OF INVESTED CAPITAL.  (a)  Gas utility rates shall be based on the adjusted value of invested capital used and useful to the utility in providing service and that adjusted value shall be computed on the basis of a reasonable balance between:
    
    (1)  original cost, less depreciation;  and
    
    (2)  current cost, less an adjustment for present age and condition.
    
    (b)  The regulatory authority may determine a reasonable balance that reflects:
    
    (1)  not less than 60 percent nor more than 75 percent of the original cost of the property at the time the property was dedicated to public use, whether by the gas utility that is the present owner or by a predecessor, less depreciation;  and
    
    (2)  not less than 25 percent nor more than 40 percent of the current cost less an adjustment for present age and condition.
    
    (c)  In determining a reasonable balance, the regulatory authority may consider inflation, deflation, quality of service being provided, growth rate of the service area, and need for the gas utility to attract new capital.
    
    (d)  Construction work in progress, at cost as recorded on the gas utility's books, may be included as part of the adjusted value of invested capital used by and useful to the utility in providing service, as necessary to the financial integrity of the utility.
    
    (e)  Costs of facilities, revenues, expenses, taxes, and reserves shall be separated or allocated as prescribed by the regulatory authority.
    
    (f)  In this section, "original cost" means the actual money cost or the actual money value of consideration paid other than money.

    Sec. 104.054.  DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, AND DEPLETION.  (a)  The railroad commission shall establish proper and adequate rates and methods of depreciation, amortization, or depletion for each class of property of a gas utility or municipally owned utility.
    
    (b)  The rates and methods established under this section and the depreciation account required under Section [102.152](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=102.152) shall be used uniformly and consistently throughout rate-setting and appeal proceedings.

    Sec. 104.055.  NET INCOME;  ALLOWABLE EXPENSES.  (a)  Net income shall be used to establish just and reasonable rates.  For that purpose, "net income" means the total revenues of the gas utility from gas utility service less all reasonable and necessary expenses related to that gas utility service.  The regulatory authority shall determine those revenues and expenses in a manner consistent with this subchapter.
    
    (b)  In establishing a gas utility's rates, the regulatory authority may not allow a gas utility's payment to an affiliate for the cost of a service, property, right, or other item or for an interest expense to be included as capital cost or as expense related to gas utility service except to the extent that the regulatory authority finds the payment is reasonable and necessary for each item or class of items as determined by the regulatory authority.  That finding must include:
    
    (1)  a specific finding of the reasonableness and necessity of each item or class of items allowed;  and
    
    (2)  a finding that the price to the gas utility is not higher than the prices charged by the supplying affiliate to its other affiliates or divisions or to a nonaffiliated person for the same item or class of items.
    
    (c)  If an expense is allowed to be included in utility rates, or an investment is included in the utility rate base, the related income tax deduction or benefit shall be included in the computation of income tax expense to reduce the rates.  If an expense is disallowed or not included in utility rates, or an investment is not included in the utility rate base, the related income tax deduction or benefit may not be included in the computation of income tax expense to reduce the rates.  The income tax expense shall be computed using the statutory income tax rates.
    
    (d)  The regulatory authority may adopt reasonable rules complying with this section with respect to including and excluding certain expenses in computing the rates to be established.
    
    (e)  This section is not intended to increase gas utility rates to the customer not caused by utility service.  Utility rates may include only expenses caused by utility service.

    Sec. 104.056.  TREATMENT OF CERTAIN TAX BENEFITS.  (a)  In determining the allocation of tax savings derived from liberalized depreciation and amortization, the investment tax credit, and the application of similar methods, the regulatory authority shall:
    
    (1)  balance equitably the interests of present and future customers;  and
    
    (2)  apportion accordingly the benefits between consumers and the gas utility or municipally owned utility.
    
    (b)  If a gas utility or municipally owned utility retains a portion of the investment tax credit, that portion shall be deducted from the original cost of the facilities or other addition to the rate base to which the credit applied to the extent allowed by the Internal Revenue Code.

    Sec. 104.057.  CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN EXPENSES.  (a)  In establishing a gas utility's rates, the regulatory authority may not allow as a cost or expense an expenditure:
    
    (1)  described by Section [102.154](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=102.154) that the regulatory authority determines to be not in the public interest;  or
    
    (2)  for legislative advocacy.
    
    (b)  The regulatory authority may allow as a cost or expense reasonable charitable or civic contributions not to exceed the amount approved by the regulatory authority.
    
    
    
    
    Acts 1997, 75th Leg., ch. 166, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1997.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 104.058.  CONSIDERATION OF PROFIT OR LOSS FROM SALE OR LEASE OF MERCHANDISE.  In establishing a gas utility's or municipally owned utility's rates, the regulatory authority may not consider a profit or loss that results from the sale or lease of merchandise, including appliances, fixtures, or equipment, to the extent that merchandise is not integral to providing utility service.
    
    
    
    
    Acts 1997, 75th Leg., ch. 166, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1997.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 104.059.  PENSION AND OTHER POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS.  (a)  In establishing a gas utility's rates, the regulatory authority shall allow recovery of the gas utility's costs of pensions and other postemployment benefits, as determined by actuarial or other similar studies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, in amounts the regulatory authority finds reasonable and necessary.
    
    (b)  If a gas utility establishes one or more reserve accounts for the purpose of tracking changes in the costs of pensions and other postemployment benefits, the gas utility shall periodically record in a reserve account any difference between:
    
    (1)  the annual amount of pension and other postemployment benefits approved and included in the gas utility's then current rates or, if that annual amount cannot be determined from the regulatory authority's order, the amount recorded for pension and other postemployment benefits under generally accepted accounting principles during the first year that rates from the gas utility's last general rate proceeding were in effect; and
    
    (2)  the annual amount of costs of pensions and other postemployment benefits as determined by actuarial or other similar studies that would otherwise be recorded by the gas utility were this provision not applicable.
    
    (c)  The gas utility must:
    
    (1)  establish separate reserve accounts for pensions and for other postemployment benefits; and
    
    (2)  apply the same methodology to allocate pension and other postemployment benefits between capital and expense as in the gas utility's last rate case.
    
    (d)  A surplus in a reserve account exists if the amount of pension and other postemployment benefits under Subsection (b)(1) is greater than the amount determined under Subsection (b)(2).  A shortage in a reserve account exists if the amount of pension and other postemployment benefits under Subsection (b)(1) is less than the amount determined under Subsection (b)(2).
    
    (e)  If the gas utility establishes reserve accounts for the costs of pensions and other postemployment benefits, the regulatory authority at a subsequent general rate proceeding shall:
    
    (1)  review the amounts recorded to each reserve account to determine whether the amounts are reasonable and necessary;
    
    (2)  determine in accordance with Subsection (d) whether each reserve account has a surplus or shortage; and
    
    (3)  subtract any surplus from or add any shortage to the gas utility's rate base, with the surplus or shortage amortized over a reasonable time.

(a)  If a schedule modifying or increasing rates is filed with a regulatory authority, the regulatory authority shall, on complaint by an affected person, or may, on its own motion, not later than the 30th day after the effective date of the increase, enter on a hearing to determine the propriety of the increase.
    
    (b)  The regulatory authority shall hold a hearing in every case in which the increase constitutes a major change.

    (2)  the railroad commission may suspend the operation of the schedule for not longer than 150 days after the date the schedule would otherwise be effective.
    
    (b)  The 150-day period prescribed by Subsection (a)(2) shall be extended for two days for each day the actual hearing on the merits of the case exceeds 15 days.

    SUBCHAPTER G. INTERIM COST RECOVERY AND RATE ADJUSTMENT
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 104.301.  INTERIM ADJUSTMENT FOR CHANGES IN INVESTMENT.  (a)  A gas utility that has filed a rate case under Subchapter C within the preceding two years may file with the regulatory authority a tariff or rate schedule that provides for an interim adjustment in the utility's monthly customer charge or initial block rate to recover the cost of changes in the investment in service for gas utility services.  The adjustment shall be allocated among the gas utility's classes of customers in the same manner as the cost of service was allocated among classes of customers in the utility's latest effective rates for the area in which the tariff or rate schedule is implemented.  The gas utility shall file the tariff or rate schedule, or the annual adjustment under Subsection (c), with the regulatory authority at least 60 days before the proposed implementation date of the tariff, rate schedule, or annual adjustment.  The gas utility shall provide notice of the tariff, rate schedule, or annual adjustment to affected customers by bill insert or direct mail not later than the 45th day after the date the utility files the tariff, rate schedule, or annual adjustment with the regulatory authority.  During the 60-day period, the regulatory authority may act to suspend the implementation of the tariff, rate schedule, or annual adjustment for up to 45 days.  After the issuance of a final order or decision by a regulatory authority in a rate case that is filed after the implementation of a tariff or rate schedule under this section, any change in investment that has been included in an interim adjustment in accordance with the tariff or rate schedule under this section shall no longer be subject to subsequent review for reasonableness or prudence.  Until the issuance of a final order or decision by a regulatory authority in a rate case that is filed after the implementation of a tariff or rate schedule under this section, all amounts collected under the tariff or rate schedule before the filing of the rate case are subject to refund.
    
    (b)  The amount the gas utility shall adjust the utility's rates upward or downward under the tariff or rate schedule each calendar year is based on the difference between the value of the invested capital for the preceding calendar year and the value of the invested capital for the calendar year preceding that calendar year.  The value of the invested capital is equal to the original cost of the investment at the time the investment was first dedicated to public use minus the accumulated depreciation related to that investment.
    
    (c)  The interim adjustment shall be recalculated on an annual basis in accordance with the requirements of Subsection (b).  The gas utility may file a request with the regulatory authority to suspend the operation of the tariff or rate schedule for any year.  The request must be in writing and state the reasons why the suspension is justified.  The regulatory authority may grant the suspension on a showing by the utility of reasonable justification.
    
    (d)  A gas utility may only adjust the utility's rates under the tariff or rate schedule for the return on investment, depreciation expense, ad valorem taxes, revenue related taxes, and incremental federal income taxes related to the difference in the value of the invested capital as determined under Subsection (b).  The return on investment, depreciation, and incremental federal income tax factors used in the computation must be the same as the factors reflected in the final order issued by or settlement agreement approved by the regulatory authority establishing the gas utility's latest effective rates for the area in which the tariff or rate schedule is implemented.
    
    (e)  A gas utility that implements a tariff or rate schedule under this section shall file with the regulatory authority an annual report describing the investment projects completed and placed in service during the preceding calendar year and the investments retired or abandoned during the preceding calendar year.  The annual report shall also state the cost, need, and customers benefited by the change in investment.
    
    (f)  In addition to the report required under Subsection (e), the gas utility shall file with the regulatory authority an annual earnings monitoring report demonstrating the utility's earnings during the preceding calendar year.
    
    (g)  If the gas utility is earning a return on invested capital, as demonstrated by the report filed under Subsection (f), of more than 75 basis points above the return established in the latest effective rates approved by a regulatory authority for the area in which the tariff or rate schedule is implemented under this section, the gas utility shall file a statement with that report stating the reasons why the rates are not unreasonable or in violation of law.
    
    (h)  If a gas utility that implements a tariff or rate schedule under this section does not file a rate case under Subchapter C before the fifth anniversary of the date on which the tariff or rate schedule takes effect, the gas utility shall file a rate case under that subchapter not later than the 180th day after that anniversary in relation to any rates subject to the tariff or rate schedule.
    
    (i)  This section does not limit the power of a regulatory authority under Section [104.151](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=104.151).
    
    (j)  A gas utility implementing a tariff or rate schedule under this section shall reimburse the railroad commission the utility's proportionate share of the railroad commission's costs related to the administration of the interim rate adjustment mechanism provided by this section.

    SUBCHAPTER I.  CUSTOMER RATE RELIEF BONDS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 104.361.  PURPOSE; RAILROAD COMMISSION DUTY.  (a)  The purpose of this subchapter is to reduce the cost that customers would otherwise experience because of extraordinary costs that gas utilities incurred to secure gas supply and provide service during Winter Storm Uri, and to restore gas utility systems after that event, by providing securitization financing for gas utilities to recover those costs.  The securitization financing mechanism authorized by this subchapter will:
    
    (1)  provide rate relief to customers by extending the period during which the costs described by this subsection are recovered from customers; and
    
    (2)  support the financial strength and stability of gas utility companies.
    
    (b)  The railroad commission shall ensure that securitization provides tangible and quantifiable benefits to customers, greater than would have been achieved absent the issuance of customer rate relief bonds.

    Sec. 104.367.  PROPERTY RIGHTS.  (a)  Customer rate relief bonds are the limited obligation solely of the issuing financing entity and are not a debt of a gas utility or a debt or a pledge of the faith and credit of this state or any political subdivision of this state.
    
    (b)  Customer rate relief bonds are nonrecourse to the credit or any assets of this state or the authority.  A trust fund created in connection with the issuance of customer rate relief bonds is not subject to Subtitle B, Title 9, Property Code.
    
    (c)  The rights and interests of an issuing financing entity or the successor under a financing order, including the right to receive customer rate relief charges authorized in the financing order, are only contract rights until pledged in connection with the issuance of the customer rate relief bonds, at which time the rights and interests become customer rate relief property.
    
    (d)  Customer rate relief property created under a financing order is vested ab initio in the issuing financing entity.  Customer rate relief property constitutes a present property right for purposes of contracts concerning the sale or pledge of property, notwithstanding that the imposition and collection of customer rate relief charges depends on further  acts of the gas utility or others that have not yet occurred.  The financing order remains in effect, and the customer rate relief property continues to exist, for the same period as the pledge of the state described by Section [104.374](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=104.374).
    
    (e)  All revenue and collections resulting from customer rate relief charges constitute proceeds only of a property right arising from the financing order.
    
    (f)  An amount owed by an issuing financing entity under an ancillary agreement or a credit agreement is payable from and secured by a pledge and interest in the customer rate relief property to the extent provided in the documents evidencing the ancillary agreement or credit agreement.

    Sec. 104.368.  PROPERTY INTEREST NOT SUBJECT TO SETOFF, COUNTERCLAIM, SURCHARGE, OR DEFENSE.  The interest of an issuing financing entity or pledgee in customer rate relief property, including the revenue and collections arising from customer rate relief charges, is not subject to setoff, counterclaim, surcharge, or defense by the gas utility or any other person or in connection with the bankruptcy of the gas utility, the authority, or any other entity.  A financing order remains in effect and unabated notwithstanding the bankruptcy of the gas utility, the authority, an issuing financing entity, or any successor or assignee of the gas utility, authority, or issuing financing entity.

    Sec. 104.370.  TRUE-UP MECHANISM.  (a)  A financing order must include a formulaic true-up charge adjustment mechanism that requires that the customer rate relief charges be reviewed and adjusted at least annually by the servicer or replacement servicer, including a subservicer or replacement subservicer, at time periods and frequencies provided in the financing order, to:
    
    (1)  correct any overcollections or undercollections of the preceding 12 months; and
    
    (2)  ensure the expected recovery of amounts sufficient to provide for the timely payment of customer rate relief bond principal and interest payments and other financing costs.
    
    (b)  True-up charge adjustments must become effective not later than the 30th day after the date the railroad commission receives a true-up charge adjustment letter from the servicer or replacement servicer notifying the railroad commission of the pending adjustment.
    
    (c)  Any administrative review of true-up charge adjustments must be limited to notifying the servicer of mathematical or clerical errors in the calculation.

    Sec. 104.371.  SECURITY INTERESTS; ASSIGNMENT; COMMINGLING; DEFAULT.  (a)  Customer rate relief property does not constitute an account or general intangible under Section [9.106](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.106), Business & Commerce Code.  The creation, granting, perfection, and enforcement of liens and security interests in customer rate relief property that secures customer rate relief bonds are governed by Chapter [1208](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=1208), Government Code.
    
    (b)  The priority of a lien and security interest perfected under this section is not impaired by any later adjustment of customer rate relief charges under a mechanism adopted under Section [104.370](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=104.370) or by the commingling of funds arising from customer rate relief charges with other funds.  Any other security interest that may apply to those funds is terminated when the funds are transferred to a segregated account for the issuing financing entity or a financing party.  If customer rate relief property has been transferred to a trustee or another pledgee of the issuing financing entity, any proceeds of that property must be held in trust for the financing party.
    
    (c)  If a default or termination occurs under the customer rate relief bonds, a district court of Travis County, on application by or on behalf of the financing parties, shall order the sequestration and payment to the financing parties of revenue arising from the customer rate relief charges.

    Sec. 104.372.  BOND PROCEEDS IN TRUST.  (a)  The issuing financing entity may deposit proceeds of customer rate relief bonds issued by the issuing financing entity under this subchapter with a trustee selected by the issuing financing entity or the proceeds may be held by the comptroller in a dedicated trust fund outside the state treasury in the custody of the comptroller.
    
    (b)  Bond proceeds, net of the financing costs and reserves described by Subdivisions (2) and (3), including investment income, must be held in trust for the exclusive benefit of the railroad commission's policy of reimbursing gas utility costs and applied in accordance with the financing order.  The issuing financing entity shall deliver the net proceeds, as provided in the applicable financing order, to:
    
    (1)  reimburse each gas utility the regulatory asset amount determined to be reasonable for that gas utility in the financing order;
    
    (2)  pay the financing costs of issuing the bonds; and
    
    (3)  provide bond reserves or fund any capitalized interest, as applicable.

A gas utility and its successors, assignees, or replacements shall continue to bill and collect customer rate relief charges from the gas utility's current and future customers until all customer rate relief bonds and financing costs are paid in full.
    
    (b)  The authority shall report to the railroad commission the amount of the outstanding customer rate relief bonds issued by the issuing financing entity under this subchapter and the estimated amount of annual bond administrative expenses.
    
    (c)  All revenue collected from the customer rate relief charges shall be remitted promptly by the applicable servicers to the issuing financing entity or the bond trustee for the customer rate relief bonds to pay bond obligations and ongoing financing costs, including bond administrative expenses, to ensure timely payment of bond obligations and financing costs.

    Sec. 104.374.  PLEDGE OF STATE.  (a)  Customer rate relief bonds issued under this subchapter and any related ancillary agreements or credit agreements are not a debt or pledge of the faith and credit of this state or a state agency or political subdivision of this state.  A customer rate relief bond, ancillary agreement, or credit agreement is payable solely from customer rate relief charges as provided by this subchapter.
    
    (b)  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), this state, including the railroad commission and the authority, pledges for the benefit and protection of the financing parties and the gas utility that this state will not take or permit any action that would impair the value of customer rate relief property, or, except as permitted by Section [104.370](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=104.370), reduce, alter, or impair the customer rate relief charges to be imposed, collected, and remitted to financing parties until the principal, interest and premium, and contracts to be performed in connection with the related customer rate relief bonds and financing costs have been paid and performed in full.
