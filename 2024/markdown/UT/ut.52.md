    SUBCHAPTER A. GENERAL POWERS AND DUTIES OF COMMISSION
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 52.001.  POLICY.  (a)  It is the policy of this state to protect the public interest in having adequate and efficient telecommunications service available to each resident of this state at just, fair, and reasonable rates.
    
    (b)  The telecommunications industry, through technical advancements, federal legislative, judicial, and administrative actions, and the formulation of new telecommunications enterprises, has become and will continue to be in many and growing areas a competitive industry that does not lend itself to traditional public utility regulatory rules, policies, and principles.  As a result, the public interest requires that rules, policies, and principles be formulated and applied to:
    
    (1)  protect the public interest;  and
    
    (2)  provide equal opportunity to each telecommunications utility in a competitive marketplace.

(a)  To carry out the public policy stated by Section [52.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=52.001) and to regulate rates, operations, and services so that the rates are just, fair, and reasonable and the services are adequate and efficient, the commission has exclusive original jurisdiction over the business and property of a telecommunications utility in this state subject to the limitations imposed by this title.
    
    (b)  The commission's regulatory authority as to a telecommunications utility other than a public utility is only as prescribed by this title.
    
    (c)  The commission may not require a telecommunications utility that is not a public utility, including a deregulated or transitioning company, to comply with a requirement or standard that is more burdensome than a requirement or standard the commission imposes on a public utility.
    
    (d)  Notwithstanding any other law, a department, agency, or political subdivision of this state may not by rule, order, or other means directly or indirectly regulate rates charged for, service or contract terms for, conditions for, or requirements for entry into the market for Voice over Internet Protocol services or other Internet Protocol enabled services.  This subsection does not:
    
    (1)  affect requirements pertaining to use of a right-of-way or payment of right-of-way fees applicable to Voice over Internet Protocol services under Chapter [283](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=283), Local Government Code;
    
    (2)  affect any person's obligation to provide video or cable service, as defined under applicable state or federal law, the applicability of Chapter [66](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=66), or a requirement to make a payment under Chapter [66](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=66);
    
    (3)  require or prohibit assessment of enhanced 9-1-1, relay access service, or universal service fund fees on Voice over Internet Protocol service;
    
    (4)  affect any entity's obligations under Sections 251 and 252, Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. Sections 251 and 252), or a right granted to an entity by those sections;
    
    (5)  affect any applicable wholesale tariff;
    
    (6)  grant, modify, or affect the authority of the commission to implement, carry out, or enforce the rights or obligations provided by Sections 251 and 252, Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. Sections 251 and 252), or of an applicable wholesale tariff through arbitration proceedings or other available mechanisms and procedures;
    
    (7)  require or prohibit payment of switched network access rates or other intercarrier compensation rates, as applicable;
    
    (8)  limit any commission authority over the subjects listed in Subdivisions (1)-(7) or grant the commission any authority over those subjects; or
    
    (9)  affect the assessment, administration, collection, or enforcement of any tax or fee over which the comptroller has authority.

    (2)  may make changes in its tariffs, price lists, and customer service agreements in relation to services that are not subject to regulation without commission approval; and
    
    (3)  may cross-reference its federal tariff in its state tariff if the provider's intrastate switched access rates are the same as the provider's interstate switched access rates.
    
    (c)  A telecommunications provider may withdraw a tariff, price list, or customer service agreement not required to be filed or maintained with the commission under this section if the telecommunications provider:

    (1)  a nonbasic retail service or the service's rates, terms, or conditions; or
    
    (2)  for a market that has been deregulated, a basic network service or the service's rates, terms, or conditions.
    
    (d-3)  Unless an interconnection agreement contract specifies otherwise, an incumbent local exchange carrier shall continue to provide to affected resellers of retail services the same notice of rate changes or withdrawal of detariffed services that it was required to provide prior to detariffing.

    (2)  the extent to which the service is available in the relevant market;
