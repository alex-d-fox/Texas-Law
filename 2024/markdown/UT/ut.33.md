The charge imposed shall be equal to the total electric franchise fee revenue due the municipality from electric utilities, municipally owned utilities, or electric cooperatives, as appropriate, for calendar year 1998 divided by the total kilowatt hours delivered during 1998 by the applicable electric utility, municipally owned utility, or electric cooperative to retail customers whose consuming facilities' points of delivery were located within the municipality's boundaries.

    (e)  A municipality may conduct an audit or other inquiry or may pursue any cause of action in relation to an electric utility's, transmission and distribution utility's, municipally owned utility's, or electric cooperative's payment of charges authorized by this section only if such audit, inquiry, or pursuit of a cause of action concerns a payment made less than two years before commencement of such audit, inquiry, or pursuit of a cause of action;  provided, however, that this subsection does not apply to an audit, inquiry, or cause of action commenced before September 1, 1999.  An electric utility, transmission and distribution utility, municipally owned utility, or electric cooperative shall, on request of the municipality in connection with a municipal audit, identify the service provider and the type of service delivered for any service in addition to electricity delivered directly to retail customers through the utility's electricity-conducting facilities that are located in the municipality's streets, alleys, or public ways and for which the utility receives compensation.
    
    (f)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, on the expiration of a franchise agreement existing on September 1, 1999, an electric utility, transmission and distribution utility, municipally owned utility, or electric cooperative and a municipality may mutually agree to a different level of compensation or to a different method for determining the amount the municipality may charge for the use of a municipal street, alley, or public way in connection with the delivery of electricity at retail within the municipality.
    
    (g)  After the end of the freeze period or after implementation of customer choice by the municipally owned utility or electric cooperative, as appropriate, a newly incorporated municipality or a municipality that has not previously collected compensation for the delivery of electricity at retail within the municipality may adopt and collect compensation based on the same rate per kilowatt hour that is collected by any other municipality in the same county that is served by the same electric utility, transmission and distribution utility, municipally owned utility, or electric cooperative.

    SUBCHAPTER E. RATE DETERMINATION AND APPEAL OF ORDERS OF CERTAIN MUNICIPAL UTILITIES
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 33.121.  APPLICATION OF COMMISSION REVIEW.  A municipally owned utility is subject to this subchapter if the utility is a utility:
    
    (1)  whose rates are appealed under Subchapter D; 
    
    (2)  for which the commission orders a decrease in annual nonfuel base revenues that exceeds the greater of $25,000,000 or 10 percent of the utility's nonfuel base revenues, as computed on a total system basis without regard to the utility's municipal boundaries and established in the appealed rate ordinance;  and
    
    (3)  for which the commission finds that the rates paid by the combined residential or other major customer class, other than a class in which the municipality is the customer of the municipally owned utility, are removed from cost-of-service levels to the extent that, under the nonfuel base revenue requirement adopted by the commission as computed on a total system basis without regard to the municipality's boundaries, a change in nonfuel base rate revenues in excess of 50 percent from adjusted test year levels would be required to move that class to a relative rate of return of unity (1.00 or 100 percent) under the cost-of-service methodology adopted by the commission in an appeal under Subchapter D.
    
    
    
    
    Acts 1997, 75th Leg., ch. 166, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1997.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 33.122.  REVIEW OF CERTAIN RATE DECISIONS.  (a)  Except as provided by Subsections (b)-(f), for a period of 10 years beginning on the later of August 28, 1989, or the effective date of the rate ordinance that is the subject of the commission's final order invoking the application of this section, the commission has appellate jurisdiction over the rates charged by the municipally owned utility, both inside and outside the municipality, in the same manner and subject to the same commission powers and authority provided by this subtitle for an electric utility.
    
    (b)  The commission has jurisdiction to review the cost allocation and rate design methodologies adopted by the governing body of a municipally owned utility subject to this section.  If the commission finds that the cost-of-service methodologies result in rates that are unjust, unreasonable, or unreasonably discriminatory, or unduly preferential to a customer class, the commission may order the implementation of ratesetting methodologies the commission finds reasonable.
    
    (c)  The commission shall ensure that a customer class, other than a class in which the municipality is the customer of the municipally owned utility, does not pay rates that result in a relative rate of return of more than 115 percent under the cost-of-service methodology found reasonable by the commission.  A customer class may not experience a percentage base rate increase that is greater than 1-1/2 times the system average base increase.  In moving an above-cost class toward cost-of-service levels, each class farthest above cost shall be moved sequentially toward cost so that no above-cost class moves toward cost until no other class is further removed from cost.
    
    (d)  A municipality subject to this section may design residential rates, as a matter of intra-class rate design, to accomplish reasonable energy conservation goals, notwithstanding any other provision of this title.
    
    (e)  The commission's jurisdiction under this section may be invoked by any party to a local rate proceeding required by this section in the same manner as an appeal of the rates of an electric utility under Section [33.051](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=33.051).
    
    (f)  The commission's jurisdiction under this section does not extend to a municipally owned utility's:
    
    (1)  revenue requirements, whether base rate or fuel revenues;
    
    (2)  invested capital;
    
    (3)  return on invested capital;
    
    (4)  debt service coverage ratio;  or
    
    (5)  level of transfer of revenues from the utility to the municipality's general fund.
    
    (g)  The governing body of a municipally owned utility subject to this section shall establish procedures similar to the procedures of a municipality that retains original jurisdiction under Section [33.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=33.001) to regulate an electric utility operating in the municipality.  The procedures must include a public hearing process in which an affected ratepayer is granted party status on request and is grouped for purposes of participation in accordance with common or divergent interests, including the particular interests of all-electric residential ratepayers and residential ratepayers outside the municipality.
    
    (h)  This section does not require the governing body of a municipality or the governing board of a municipally owned utility subject to this section to adopt procedures that require the use of the Texas Rules of Evidence, the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, or the presentation of sworn testimony or any other form of sworn evidence.
    
    (i)  The governing body of a municipally owned utility subject to this section shall appoint a consumer advocate to represent the interests of residential and small commercial ratepayers in the municipality's local rate proceedings.  The consumer advocate's reasonable costs of participating in a proceeding, including the reasonable costs of ratemaking consultants and expert witnesses, shall be funded by and recovered from residential and small commercial ratepayers.
    
    (j)  The commission shall adopt rules applicable to a party to an appeal under Subchapter D  that provide for the public disclosure of financial and in-kind contributions and expenditures related to preparing and filing an appeal petition and preparing expert testimony or legal representation for an appeal.  A party or customer who is a member of a party who makes a financial contribution or in-kind contribution to assist in an appeal by another party or customer class under Subchapter D shall be required, on a finding of the commission to that effect, to pay the municipally owned utility a penalty equivalent in amount to two times the amount of the contribution.
    
    (k)  This section does not limit the right of a party or customer to spend money to represent its own interests following the filing of a petition with the commission under Subchapter D.

    Sec. 33.123.  REVIEW OF CERTAIN DECISIONS FOR RATES CHARGED OUTSIDE MUNICIPALITY.  (a)  For a period of 10 years beginning on the later of August 28, 1989, or the effective date of the rate ordinance that is the subject of the commission's final order invoking the application of this section, the commission has appellate jurisdiction over the rates charged by the municipally owned utility, outside the municipality, as provided by this section.
    
    (b)  Except as otherwise provided by this section, a ratepayer of a municipally owned utility subject to this section who resides outside the municipality may appeal any action of the governing body of a municipality affecting the rates charged by the municipally owned utility outside the municipality by filing a petition for review with the commission in the manner provided for an appeal under Subchapter D.  The petition must plainly disclose that the cost of the appeal will be funded by a surcharge on the monthly electric bills of ratepayers outside the municipality as prescribed by the commission.
    
    (c)  After the commission approves the sufficiency of a petition, the appellants shall submit to the office for approval a budget itemizing the scope and expected cost of consultant services to be purchased by the appellants in the appeal.
    
    (d)  Not later than the 120th day after the date the commission enters its final order, the municipality shall assess a onetime surcharge on a per capita basis among residential ratepayers who reside outside the municipality to pay the reasonable consultant and legal costs approved by the counsellor.  The municipality shall reimburse the appellants for incurred costs not later than the 90th day after the date the commission enters its final order.
    
    (e)  A municipality may not:
    
    (1)  include the costs associated with its defense of an appeal under this section in the rates charged a ratepayer outside the municipality;  or
    
    (2)  if the municipality appeals an order entered by the commission under this section, include the costs associated with its appeal in the rates charged a ratepayer outside the municipality.
    
    (f)  A ratepayer who brings an appeal under this section may not receive funding for rate case expenses except from a residential ratepayer who resides outside the municipality or from another municipality inside whose boundaries the municipally owned utility provides service.  The commission shall adopt rules for reporting financial and in-kind contributions in support of an appeal under this section.  If the commission finds that an appellant has received contributions from a source other than from a ratepayer who resides outside the municipality or from another municipality, the appeal and each commission order entered in the appeal are void.
    
    (g)  The commission has jurisdiction in an appeal under this section to review and ensure that the revenue requirements of a municipally owned utility subject to this section are reasonable.  The jurisdiction under this subsection does not extend to regulating the use and level of a transfer of the utility's revenues to the municipality's general fund.
    
    (h)  The commission has jurisdiction to review the cost allocation and rate design methodologies adopted by the governing body of a municipally owned utility subject to this section.  If the commission finds that the cost-of-service methodologies result in rates that are unjust, unreasonable, or unreasonably discriminatory or unduly preferential to a customer class, the commission may order the implementation of ratesetting methodologies the commission finds reasonable.  The commission's jurisdiction under this subsection does not include intra-class residential rate design.
    
    (i)  An intervenor in an appeal under this section is limited to presenting evidence on cost allocation and rate design methodologies, except that an intervenor may present evidence in support of the municipality on an issue related to utility revenues.
    
    (j)  A ratepayer of a municipally owned utility subject to this section who resides outside the municipality may elect to petition for review under either this section or Subchapter D when appealing a rate ordinance or other ratesetting action of the governing body of a municipality.
