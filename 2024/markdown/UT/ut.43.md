    SUBTITLE B. ELECTRIC UTILITIES
    
      
    
    
    CHAPTER 43.  PROVISION OF MIDDLE MILE BROADBAND SERVICE BY ELECTRIC UTILITIES
    
      
    
    
    SUBCHAPTER A.  GENERAL PROVISIONS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 43.001.  LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.  (a)  The legislature finds that access to quality, high-speed broadband Internet service is important to this state, is a necessary prerequisite for enabling economic development and improving education, health care, public safety, and government services in this state, and provides other benefits to its citizens.
    
    (b)   The legislature finds that broadband development in unserved and underserved areas of Texas can be facilitated by the participation of electric utilities in this state that own and operate facilities that may be useful for the full deployment of broadband service by Internet service providers throughout this state.
    
    (c)  The legislature finds that electric utilities have existing infrastructure in place throughout this state and that excess fiber capacity on that infrastructure could be used to provide middle mile broadband service in unserved and underserved areas.
    
    (d)  The legislature finds that it is in the public interest to encourage the deployment of broadband service in unserved and underserved areas by permitting electric utilities to own, construct, or operate fiber facilities for the support of electric service and to lease excess fiber capacity for the provision of middle mile broadband service.  The purpose of this chapter is to provide the appropriate framework to facilitate the leasing of excess fiber capacity on electric utility facilities.
    
    (e)  The legislature finds that an electric utility may choose to implement middle mile broadband service to lease excess fiber capacity to Internet service providers under the procedures set forth in this chapter, but is not required to do so.  The electric utility shall have the right to decide, in its sole discretion, whether to implement middle mile broadband service and may not be penalized for deciding to implement or not to implement that service.

    Sec. 43.053.  NO ADDITIONAL EASEMENTS OR CONSIDERATION REQUIRED.  (a)  Because broadband systems provide benefits to electric delivery systems, the installation of facilities to provide middle mile broadband service on an electric delivery system or other facilities does not require the electric utility or an entity defined in Section [11.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=11.003)(9) to obtain, modify, or expand easements or other rights-of-way for the middle mile broadband service or to give additional consideration as a result of the installation or the operation of middle mile broadband service on the electric delivery system or other facilities of the electric utility or entity, unless the property owner protests the use as provided by this section.
    
    (b)  Not later than the 60th day before the date an electric utility begins construction in an easement or other property right of fiber optic cables and other facilities for providing middle mile broadband service, the electric utility shall provide written notice to the owners of the affected property of the electric utility's intent to use the easement or other property right for middle mile broadband service.
    
    (c)  Notice under this section must:
    
    (1)  be sent by first class mail to the last known address of each person in whose name the affected property is listed on the most recent tax roll of each county authorized to levy property taxes against the property; and
    
    (2)  state whether any new fiber optic cables used for middle mile broadband service will be located above or below ground in the easement or other property right.
    
    (d)  Not later than the 60th day after the date an electric utility mails notice under this section, a property owner entitled to the notice may submit to the electric utility a written protest of the intended use of the easement or other property right for middle mile broadband service.  An electric utility that receives a timely written protest may not use the easement or other property right for middle mile broadband service unless the protestor later agrees in writing to that use or that use is authorized by law.  If a property owner fails to submit a timely written protest, an electric utility may proceed under Subsection (a) without modifying or expanding the easement for that property owner.
    
    (e)  An electric utility that receives a timely written protest under Subsection (d) regarding proposed middle mile broadband service may cancel the project at any time.
    
    (f)  The requirements of this section do not apply to an existing easement that permits the provision of third-party middle mile broadband service on an electric delivery system.

    Sec. 43.054.  RELIABILITY OF ELECTRIC SYSTEMS MAINTAINED.  An electric utility that installs and operates facilities to provide middle mile broadband service shall employ all reasonable measures to ensure that the operation of the middle mile broadband service does not interfere with or diminish the reliability of the utility's electric delivery system.  If a disruption in the provision of electric service occurs, the electric utility is governed by the terms and conditions of the retail electric delivery service tariff.  The electric utility may take all necessary actions regarding its middle mile broadband service and the facilities required in the provision of that service to address circumstances that may pose health, safety, security, or reliability concerns.  At all times, the provision of broadband service is secondary to the reliable provision of electric delivery services.  Except as provided by contract or tariff, an electric utility is not liable to any person, including an Internet service provider, for any damages, including direct, indirect, physical, economic, exemplary, or consequential damages, including loss of business, loss of profits or revenue, or loss of production capacity caused by a fluctuation, disruption, or interruption of middle mile broadband service that is caused in whole or in part by:
    
    (1)  force majeure; or 
    
    (2)  the electric utility's provision of electric delivery services, including actions taken by the electric utility to ensure the reliability and security of the electric delivery system and actions taken in response to address all circumstances that may pose health, safety, security, or reliability concerns.
