    TITLE 2. PUBLIC UTILITY REGULATORY ACT
    
      
    
    
    SUBTITLE B. ELECTRIC UTILITIES
    
      
    
    
    CHAPTER 31. GENERAL PROVISIONS
    
      
    
    
    SUBCHAPTER A.  GENERAL PROVISIONS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 31.001.  LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS;  PURPOSE OF SUBTITLE.  (a)  This subtitle is enacted to protect the public interest inherent in the rates and services of electric utilities.  The purpose of this subtitle is to establish a comprehensive and adequate regulatory system for electric utilities to assure rates, operations, and services that are just and reasonable to the consumers and to the electric utilities.
    
    (b)  Electric utilities are by definition monopolies in many of the services provided and areas they serve.  As a result, the normal forces of competition that regulate prices in a free enterprise society do not always operate.  Public agencies regulate electric utility rates, operations, and services, except as otherwise provided by this subtitle.
    
    (c)  The wholesale electric industry, through federal legislative, judicial, and administrative actions, is becoming a more competitive industry that does not lend itself to traditional electric utility regulatory rules, policies, and principles.  As a result, the public interest requires that rules, policies, and principles be formulated and applied to protect the public interest in a more competitive marketplace.  The development of a competitive wholesale electric market that allows for increased participation by electric utilities and certain nonutilities is in the public interest.
