    (2)  interest expense.

    (1)  a specific finding of the reasonableness and necessity of each item or class of items allowed;  and
    
    (2)  except as provided by Subsection (d), a finding that the price to the utility is not higher than the prices charged by the supplying affiliate to:
    
    (A)  its other affiliates or divisions for the same item or class of items;  or
    
    (B)  a nonaffiliated person within the same market area or having the same market conditions.
    
    (d)  A finding under this section is not required as to the prices charged by the supplying affiliate to its other affiliates or divisions if the supplying affiliate computed its charges to the utility in a manner consistent with Federal Communications Commission rules.
    
    (e)  If the commission finds that the affiliate expense for the test period is unreasonable, the commission shall:
    
    (1)  determine the reasonable level of the expense;  and
    
    (2)  include that expense in determining the utility's cost of service.

(a)  Unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the commission that it was reasonable to choose not to consolidate returns, a public utility's income taxes shall be computed as though a consolidated return had been filed and the utility had realized its fair share of the savings resulting from that return, if:
    
    (1)  the utility is a member of an affiliated group eligible to file a consolidated income tax return;  and
    
    (2)  it is advantageous to the utility to do so.
    
    (b)  The amount of income tax that a consolidated group of which a public utility is a member saves, because the consolidated return eliminates the intercompany profit on purchases by the utility from an affiliate, shall be applied to reduce the cost of the property or service purchased from the affiliate.
    
    (c)  The investment tax credit allowed against federal income taxes, to the extent retained by the utility, shall be applied as a reduction in the rate-based contribution of the assets to which the credit applies, to the extent and at the rate allowed by the Internal Revenue Code.

    (3)  any other expenditure, including an executive salary, advertising expense, legal expense, or civil penalty or fine the commission finds to be unreasonable, unnecessary, or not in the public interest.

    (b)  The commission shall approve a self-insurance plan under this section if the commission finds that:
    
    (1)  the coverage is in the public interest;
    
    (2)  the plan, considering all costs, is a lower cost alternative to purchasing commercial insurance;  and
    
    (3)  ratepayers will receive the benefits of the savings.
    
    (c)  In computing a utility's reasonable and necessary expenses under this subchapter, the commission, to the extent the commission finds is in the public interest, shall allow as a necessary expense money credited to a reserve account for self-insurance.  The commission shall determine reasonableness under this subsection:
    
    (1)  from information provided at the time the self-insurance plan and reserve account are established;  and
    
    (2)  on the filing of a rate case by a utility that has a reserve account.
    
    (d)  After a reserve account for self-insurance is established, the commission shall:
    
    (1)  determine whether the account has a surplus or shortage under Subsection (e);  and
    
    (2)  subtract any surplus from or add any shortage to the utility's rate base.
    
    (e)  A surplus in the reserve account exists if the charges against the account are less than the money credited to the account.  A shortage in the reserve account exists if the charges against the account are greater than the money credited to the account.
    
    (f)  The commission shall adopt rules governing self-insurance under this section.
