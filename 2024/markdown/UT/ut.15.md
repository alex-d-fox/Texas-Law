The commission may approve the plan only if the commission determines that the plan is in the public interest.  The voluntary mitigation plan must be reviewed at least once every two years and not later than the 90th day after the implementation date of a wholesale market design change.  As part of the review, the commission must determine whether the voluntary mitigation plan remains in the public interest. If the commission determines that the voluntary mitigation plan is no longer in the public interest, the commission and the person must agree to a modification of the plan or the commission must terminate the plan.  Adherence to the plan must be considered in determining whether a violation occurred and, if so, the penalty to be assessed.
    
    (g)  In this subchapter, "excess revenue" means revenue in excess of revenue that would have occurred absent a violation.

(a)  If the executive director determines that a violation has occurred, the executive director may issue to the commission a report that states the facts on which the determination is based and the executive director's recommendation on the imposition of an administrative penalty, including a recommendation on the amount of the penalty.

The administrative law judge shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law and promptly issue to the commission a proposal for a decision about the occurrence of the violation and the amount of a proposed penalty.  Based on the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and proposal for a decision, the commission by order may find that a violation has occurred and impose a penalty or disgorgement order or may find that no violation occurred.

The person who files an affidavit has the burden of proving that the person is financially unable to pay the amount of the penalty and to give a supersedeas bond.
    
    (d)  If the person does not pay the amount of the penalty and the enforcement of the penalty is not stayed, the executive director may refer the matter to the attorney general for collection of the amount of the penalty.
