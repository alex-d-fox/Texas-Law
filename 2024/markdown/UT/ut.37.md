    CHAPTER 37. CERTIFICATES OF CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY
    
      
    
    
    SUBCHAPTER A. DEFINITIONS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 37.001.  DEFINITIONS.  In this chapter:
    
    (1)  "Certificate" means a certificate of convenience and necessity.
    
    (2)  "Electric utility" includes an electric cooperative.
    
    (3)  "Retail electric utility" means a person, political subdivision, electric cooperative, or agency that operates, maintains, or controls in this state a facility to provide retail electric utility service.  The term does not include a corporation described by Section [32.053](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=32.053) to the extent that the corporation sells electricity exclusively at wholesale and not to the ultimate consumer.  A qualifying cogenerator that sells electric energy at retail to the sole purchaser of the cogenerator's thermal output under Sections [35.061](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=35.061) and [36.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=36.007) is not for that reason considered to be a retail electric utility.  The owner or operator of a qualifying cogeneration facility who was issued the necessary environmental permits from the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission after January 1, 1998, and who commenced construction of such qualifying facility before July 1, 1998, may provide electricity to the purchasers of the thermal output of that qualifying facility and shall not for that reason be considered an electric utility or a retail electric utility, provided that the purchasers of the thermal output are owners of manufacturing or process operation facilities that are located on a site entirely owned before September, 1987, by one owner who retained ownership after September, 1987, of some portion of the facilities and that those facilities now share some integrated operations, such as the provision of services and raw materials.  A person who is an electric generation equipment lessor or operator is not for that reason considered to be a retail electric utility. A person who owns or operates equipment used solely to provide electricity charging service for consumption by an alternatively fueled vehicle, as defined by Section [502.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=502.004), Transportation Code, is not for that reason considered to be a retail electric utility.

    SUBCHAPTER B. CERTIFICATE OF CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 37.051.  CERTIFICATE REQUIRED.  (a)  An electric utility may not directly or indirectly provide service to the public under a franchise or permit unless the utility first obtains from the commission a certificate that states that the public convenience and necessity requires or will require the installation, operation, or extension of the service.
    
    (b)  Except as otherwise provided by this chapter, a retail electric utility may not furnish or make available retail electric utility service to an area in which retail electric utility service is being lawfully furnished by another retail electric utility unless the utility first obtains a certificate that includes the area in which the consuming facility is located.
    
    (c)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, including Subsection (a), an electric cooperative is not required to obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the construction, installation, operation, or extension of any generating facilities or necessary interconnection facilities.
    
    (c-1)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this title except Section [11.009](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=11.009), and except as provided by Subsection (c-2), a person, including an electric utility or municipally owned utility, may not interconnect a facility to the ERCOT transmission grid that enables additional power to be imported into or exported out of the ERCOT power grid unless the person obtains a certificate from the commission stating that public convenience and necessity requires or will require the interconnection.  The person must apply for the certificate not later than the 180th day before the date the person seeks any order from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission related to the interconnection.  The commission shall apply Section [37.056](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=37.056) in considering an application under this subsection.  In addition, the commission must determine that the application is consistent with the public interest before granting the certificate.  The commission may adopt rules necessary to implement this subsection.  This subsection does not apply to a facility that is in service on December 31, 2014.
    
    (c-2)  The commission, not later than the 185th day after the date the application is filed, shall approve an application filed under Subsection (c-1) for a facility that is to be constructed under an interconnection agreement appended to an offer of settlement approved in a final order of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that was issued in Docket No. TX11-01-001 on or before December 31, 2014, directing physical connection between the ERCOT and SERC regions under Sections 210, 211, and 212 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. Sections 824i, 824j, and 824k).  In approving the application, the commission may prescribe reasonable conditions to protect the public interest that are consistent with the final order of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
    
    (c-3)  Nothing in Subsection (c-1) or (c-2) is intended to restrict the authority of the commission or the independent organization certified under Section [39.151](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=39.151) for the ERCOT power region to adopt rules or protocols of general applicability.

    Sec. 37.056.  GRANT OR DENIAL OF CERTIFICATE.  (a)  The commission may approve an application and grant a certificate only if the commission finds that the certificate is necessary for the service, accommodation, convenience, or safety of the public.
    
    (b)  The commission may:
    
    (1)  grant the certificate as requested;
    
    (2)  grant the certificate for the construction of a portion of the requested system, facility, or extension or the partial exercise of the requested right or privilege;  or
    
    (3)  refuse to grant the certificate.
    
    (c)  The commission shall grant each certificate on a nondiscriminatory basis after considering:
    
    (1)  the adequacy of existing service;
    
    (2)  the need for additional service;
    
    (3)  the effect of granting the certificate on the recipient of the certificate and any electric utility serving the proximate area; and
    
    (4)  other factors, such as:
    
    (A)  community values;
    
    (B)  recreational and park areas;
    
    (C)  historical and aesthetic values;
    
    (D)  environmental integrity;
    
    (E)  the probable improvement of service or lowering of cost to consumers in the area if the certificate is granted, including any potential economic or reliability benefits associated with dual fuel and fuel storage capabilities in areas outside the ERCOT power region; and
    
    (F)  the need for extending transmission service where existing or projected electrical loads will be underserved, including where:
    
    (i)  the existing transmission service is unreasonably remote;
    
    (ii)  the available capacity is unreasonably limited at transmission or distribution voltage level; or
    
    (iii)  the electrical load cannot be interconnected in a timely manner.
    
    (c-1)  In considering the need for additional service under Subsection (c)(2) for a reliability transmission project that serves the ERCOT power region or under Subsection (c)(4)(F), the commission must consider the historical load, forecasted load growth, and additional load currently seeking interconnection, including load for which the electric utility has yet to sign an interconnection agreement, as determined by the electric utility with the responsibility for serving the load.
    
    (d)  The commission by rule shall establish criteria, in addition to the criteria described by Subsection (c), for granting a certificate for a transmission project that serves the ERCOT power region and that is not necessary to meet state or federal reliability standards.  The criteria must include a comparison of the estimated cost of the transmission project for consumers and the estimated congestion cost savings for consumers that may result from the transmission project, considering both current and future expected congestion levels and the transmission project's ability to reduce those congestion levels.  The commission shall include with its decision on an application for a certificate to which this subsection applies findings on the criteria.
    
    (e)  A certificate to build, own, or operate a new transmission facility that directly interconnects with an existing electric utility facility or municipally owned utility facility may be granted only to the owner of that existing facility.  If a new transmission facility will directly interconnect with facilities owned by different electric utilities or municipally owned utilities, each entity shall be certificated to build, own, or operate the new facility in separate and discrete equal parts unless they agree otherwise.
    
    (f)  Notwithstanding Subsection (e), if a new transmission line, whether single or double circuit, will create the first interconnection between a load-serving station and an existing transmission facility, the entity with a load-serving responsibility or an electric cooperative that has a member with a load-serving responsibility at the load-serving station shall be certificated to build, own, or operate the new transmission line and the load-serving station.  The owner of the existing transmission facility shall be certificated to build, own, or operate the station or tap at the existing transmission facility to provide the interconnection, unless after a reasonable period of time the owner of the existing transmission facility is unwilling to build, and then the entity with the load-serving responsibility or an electric cooperative that has a member with a load-serving responsibility may be certificated to build the interconnection facility.
    
    (g)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an electric utility or municipally owned utility that is authorized to build, own, or operate a new transmission facility under Subsection (e) or (f) may designate another electric utility that is currently certificated by the commission within the same electric power region, coordinating council, independent system operator, or power pool or a municipally owned utility to build, own, or operate a portion or all of such new transmission facility, subject to any requirements adopted by the commission by rule. 
    
    (h)  The division of any required certification of facilities described in this section shall apply unless each entity agrees otherwise.  Nothing in this section is intended to require a certificate for facilities that the commission has determined by rule do not require certification to build, own, or operate.
    
    (i)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an electric cooperative may be certificated to build, own, or operate a new facility in place of any other electric cooperative if both cooperatives agree.

    (b)  An electric utility may file with the commission a request that the commission:
    
    (1)  grant a certificate for an electric generating facility;
    
    (2)  make a public interest determination for the purchase of an existing electric generating facility under Section [14.101](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=14.101); or

    Sec. 37.060.  DIVISION OF MULTIPLY CERTIFICATED SERVICE AREAS.  (a)  This subsection and Subsections (b)-(g) apply only to areas in which each retail electric utility that is authorized to provide retail electric utility service to the area is providing customer choice.  For purposes of this subsection, an electric cooperative or a municipally owned electric utility shall be deemed to be providing customer choice if it has approved a resolution adopting customer choice that is effective on January 1, 2002, or effective within 24 months after the date of the resolution adopting customer choice.  All other retail electric utilities shall be deemed to be providing customer choice if customer choice will be allowed for customers of the retail electric utility on January 1, 2002.  In areas in which each certificated retail electric utility is providing customer choice, the commission, if requested by a retail electric utility, shall examine all areas within the service area of the retail electric utility making the request that are also certificated to one or more other retail electric utilities and, after notice and hearing, shall amend the retail electric utilities' certificates so that only one retail electric utility is certificated to provide distribution services in any such area.  Only retail electric utilities certificated to serve an area on June 1, 1999, may continue to serve the area or portion of the area under an amended certificate issued under this subsection.
    
    (b)  This section does not apply in any area in which a municipally owned utility is certificated to provide retail electric utility service if the municipally owned utility serving the area files with the commission by October 1, 2001, a request that areas within the certificated service area of the municipally owned utility remain as presently certificated.
    
    (c)  The commission shall enter its order dividing multiply certificated areas within one year of the date a request is received.
    
    (d)  In amending certificates under this section, the commission shall take into consideration the factors prescribed by Section [37.056](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=37.056).
    
    (e)  Notwithstanding Section [37.059](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=37.059), the commission shall revoke certificates to the extent necessary to achieve the division of retail electric service areas as provided by this section.
    
    (f)  Unless otherwise agreed by the affected retail electric utilities, each retail electric utility shall be allowed to continue to provide service to the location of electricity-consuming facilities it is serving on the date an application for division of the affected multiply certificated service areas is filed.  No customer located within the affected multiply certificated service areas shall be permitted to switch from one retail electric utility to another while an application for division of the affected multiply certificated service areas is pending.
    
    (g)  If on June 1, 1999, retail service is being provided in an area by another retail electric utility with the written consent of the retail electric utility certificated to serve the area, that consent shall be filed with the commission.  On notification of that consent and a request by an affected retail electric utility to amend the relevant certificates, the commission may grant an exception or amend a retail electric utility's certificate.  This provision shall not be construed to limit the commission's authority to grant exceptions or to amend a retail electric utility's certificate, upon request and notification, for areas to which retail service is being provided pursuant to written consent granted after June 1, 1999.
    
    (h)  The commission may not grant an additional retail electric utility certificate to serve an area if the effect of the grant would cause the area to be multiply certificated unless the commission finds that the certificate holders are not providing service to any part of the area for which a certificate is sought and are not capable of providing adequate service to the area in accordance with applicable standards.  However, neither this subsection nor the deadline of June 1, 1999, provided by Subsection (a) shall apply to any application for multiple certification filed with the commission on or before February 1, 1999, and those applications may be processed in accordance with applicable law in effect on the date the application was filed.  Applications for multiple certification filed with the commission on or before February 1, 1999, may not be amended to expand the area for which a certificate is sought except for contiguous areas within municipalities that provide consent, as required by Section [37.053](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=37.053)(b), not later than June 1, 1999.
    
    (i)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if requested by a municipally owned utility, the commission shall examine all areas within the municipally owned utility's service area that are also certificated to one or more other retail electric utilities and, after notice and hearing, may amend the retail electric utilities' certificates so that only one retail electric utility is certificated to provide distribution services in the area, provided that:
    
    (1)  the application is filed with the commission within 12 months of the effective date of this provision and is limited to single certification of the area within the municipality's boundaries as of February 1, 1999;
    
    (2)  the commission preserves the right of an electric utility or an electric cooperative to serve its existing customers, including any property owned or leased by any customer;  and
    
    (3)  the municipality is a member city of a municipal power agency, as that term is used in Section [40.059](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=40.059).

    (2)  the municipally owned utility has an agreement existing before January 1, 1999, with a public utility serving the area that the public utility will not contest an application to amend the certificate to add municipal territory;  and
    
    (3)  the area for which a certificate is requested is not certificated to a retail electric utility that is not a party to the agreement and that has not consented in writing to certification of the area to the municipality.
    
    (b)  The commission may not amend the certificate of the public utility serving the affected area based on the granting of a certificate to the municipally owned utility.

    (b)  Notwithstanding any other law, an electric utility has the right to:
    
    (1)  continue and extend service within the utility's certificated area;  and
    
    (2)  use roads, streets, highways, alleys, and public property to furnish retail electric utility service.
    
    (c)  The governing body of a municipality may require an electric utility to relocate the utility's facility at the utility's expense to permit the widening or straightening of a street by:
    
    (1)  giving the electric utility 30 days' notice;  and
    
    (2)  specifying the new location for the facility along the right-of-way of the street.
    
    (d)  This section does not:
    
    (1)  limit the power of a city, town, or village to incorporate or of a municipality to extend its boundaries by annexation;  or
    
    (2)  prohibit a municipality from levying a tax or other special charge for the use of the streets as authorized by Section [182.025](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=182.025), Tax Code.

    (b)  In singly certificating an area under Subsection (a), the commission shall preserve the right of an electric utility to serve the customers the electric utility was serving on June 17, 1983.  This subsection does not apply to a customer at least partially served by a nominal 69,000 volts system who gave notice of termination to the utility servicing that customer before June 17, 1983.
