    (1)  provide a framework for an orderly transition from the traditional regulation of return on invested capital to a fully competitive telecommunications marketplace in which all telecommunications providers compete on fair terms;
    
    (2)  preserve and enhance universal telecommunications service at affordable rates;
    
    (3)  upgrade the telecommunications infrastructure of this state;
    
    (4)  promote network interconnectivity;  and
    
    (5)  promote diversity in the supply of telecommunications services and innovative products and services throughout the entire state, including urban and rural areas.

    (b)  The requirements prescribed by Subsection (a) do not apply to an electing company serving fewer than five million access lines after the date on which it completes the infrastructure improvements described in this subsection.

    (b)  The primary means of achieving this goal is through encouraging private investment in this state's telecommunications infrastructure by creating incentives for that investment and promoting the development of competition.
    
    (c)  The best way to bring the benefits of an advanced telecommunications network infrastructure to communities in this state is through innovation and competition among all the state's communications providers.  Competition will provide residents of this state with a choice of telecommunications providers and will drive technology deployment, innovation, service quality, and cost-based prices as competing firms try to satisfy customer needs.

    (3)  ensure the universal availability of basic local telecommunications services at reasonable rates;
    
    (4)  encourage the continued development and deployment of advanced and reliable capabilities and services in telecommunications networks;
    
    (5)  ensure interconnection and interoperability, based on uniform technical standards, among telecommunications carriers;
    
    (6)  eliminate unnecessary administrative procedures that impose regulatory barriers to competition and ensure that competitive entry is fostered on an economically rational basis;
    
    (7)  ensure consumer protection and protection against anticompetitive conduct;
    
    (8)  regulate a provider of services only to the extent the provider has market power to control the price of services to customers;
    
    (9)  encourage cost-based pricing of telecommunications services so that consumers pay a fair price for services they use;  and
    
    (10)  subject to Subchapter C, develop appropriate quality of service standards for local exchange companies so as to place this state among the leaders in deployment of an advanced telecommunications infrastructure.
