(a)  If a shareholder of the insurance company who is given notice under Section [862.152](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=862.152) does not pay the amount called for by the company under that section, the company may:
    
    (1)  require the return of the original certificate of stock held by the shareholder; and
    
    (2)  issue a new certificate for a number of shares that the shareholder may be entitled to in the proportion that the value of the funds of the company, computed without inclusion of any money or other property paid by shareholders in response to the notice under Section [862.152](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=862.152), bears to the total amount of the original capital and the minimum surplus of the company required by Section [822.054](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=822.054) or [822.210](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=822.210), subject to Subchapter B, Chapter [404](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=404).
    
    (b)  The value of any shares for which new certificates are issued under Subsection (a)(2) shall be computed under the direction of the commissioner.  The insurance company shall pay for the fractional parts of shares.
    
    (c)  Any interested person may pay all or any part of the amount of the deficit resulting from a shareholder default under Subsection (a).  The company shall issue to each person who makes a payment a stock certificate that is representative of the number of shares to which the person is entitled.  The certificate must be for the number of shares in proportion to the total number of forfeited shares that the payment made by the person bears to the deficit that resulted from the forfeited shares.
