    SUBCHAPTER A.  GENERAL PROVISIONS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 2210.001.  PURPOSE.  The primary purpose of the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association is the provision of an adequate market for windstorm and hail insurance in the seacoast territory of this state.  The legislature finds that the provision of adequate windstorm and hail insurance is necessary to the economic welfare of this state, and without that insurance, the orderly growth and development of this state would be severely impeded.  This chapter provides a method by which adequate windstorm and hail insurance may be obtained in certain designated portions of the seacoast territory of this state.  The association is intended to serve as a residual insurer of last resort for windstorm and hail insurance in the seacoast territory.  The association shall:
    
    (1)  function in such a manner as to not be a direct competitor in the private market; and
    
    (2)  provide windstorm and hail insurance coverage to those who are unable to obtain that coverage in the private market.

The association shall be reviewed during the period in which state agencies abolished in 2031 are reviewed.  The association shall pay the costs incurred by the Sunset Advisory Commission in performing the review of the association under this subsection.  The Sunset Advisory Commission shall determine the costs of the review performed under this subsection, and the association shall pay the amount of those costs promptly on receipt of a statement from the Sunset Advisory Commission regarding those costs.

(a)  Except as provided by Subsection (h), for purposes of this chapter and subject to this section, "insurable property" means immovable property at a fixed location in a catastrophe area or corporeal movable property located in that immovable property, as designated in the plan of operation, that is determined by the association according to the criteria specified in the plan of operation to be in an insurable condition against windstorm and hail, as determined by normal underwriting standards.  The term includes property described by Section [2210.209](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=2210.209).
    
    (b)  A structure located in a catastrophe area, construction of which began on or after the 30th day after the date of publication of the plan of operation, that is not built in compliance with building specifications set forth in the plan of operation or continued in compliance with those specifications, does not constitute an insurable risk for purposes of windstorm and hail insurance except as otherwise provided by this chapter.
    
    (c)  A structure, or an addition to a structure, that is constructed in conformity with plans and specifications that comply with the specifications set forth in the plan of operation at the time construction begins may not be declared ineligible for windstorm and hail insurance as a result of subsequent changes in the building specifications set forth in the plan of operation.
    
    (d)  Except as otherwise provided by this section, if repair of damage to a structure involves replacement of items covered in the building specifications set forth in the plan of operation, the repairs must be completed in a manner that complies with those specifications for the structure to continue to be insurable property for windstorm and hail insurance.
    
    (e)  If repair to a structure, other than a roof repair that exceeds 100 square feet, is less than five percent of the total amount of property coverage on the structure, the repairs may be completed in a manner that returns the structure to the structure's condition immediately before the loss without affecting the eligibility of the structure to qualify as insurable property.
    
    (f)  This chapter does not  preclude special rating of individual risks as may be provided in the plan of operation.
    
    (g)  For purposes of this chapter, a residential structure is insurable property if:
    
    (1)  the residential structure is not:
    
    (A)  a condominium, apartment, duplex, or other multifamily residence; or
    
    (B)  a hotel or resort facility;
    
    (2)  the residential structure is located within an area designated as a unit under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. No. 97-348); and
    
    (3)  a building permit or plat for the residential structure was filed with the municipality, the county, or the United States Army Corps of Engineers before June 11, 2003.
    
    (h)  For purposes of this chapter, a structure is not  insurable property if the commissioner of the General Land Office notifies the association of a determination that the structure is located on the public beach under procedures established under Section [61.011](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=61.011), Natural Resources Code, and that the structure:
    
    (1)  constitutes an imminent hazard to safety, health, or public welfare; or
    
    (2)  substantially interferes with the free and unrestricted right of the public to enter or leave the public beach or traverse any part of the public beach.

    (b)   The commissioner shall revoke a designation made under Subsection (a) if the commissioner determines, after at least 10 days' notice and a hearing, that the applicable insurance coverage is no longer reasonably unavailable to a substantial number of owners of insurable property within the designated territory.
    
    (c)  If the association determines that windstorm and hail insurance is no longer reasonably unavailable to a substantial number of owners of insurable property in a territory designated as a catastrophe area, the association may request in writing that the commissioner revoke the designation.  After at least 10 days' notice and a hearing, but not later than the 30th day after the date of the hearing, the commissioner shall:
    
    (1)  approve the request and revoke the designation; or

    Sec. 2210.202.  APPLICATION FOR COVERAGE; DECLINATION REQUIREMENT.  (a)  A person who has an insurable interest in insurable property may apply to the association for insurance coverage provided under the plan of operation and an inspection of the property, subject to any rules established by the board of directors and approved by the commissioner.  The association shall make insurance available to each applicant in the catastrophe area whose property is insurable property but who, after diligent efforts, is unable to obtain property insurance through the voluntary market, as evidenced by one declination from an insurer authorized to engage in the business of, and writing, property insurance providing windstorm and hail coverage in the first tier coastal counties.  For purposes of this section, "declination" has the meaning assigned by the plan of operation and shall include a refusal to offer coverage for the perils of windstorm and hail and the inability to obtain substantially equivalent insurance coverage for the perils of windstorm and hail.  Notwithstanding Section [2210.203](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=2210.203)(c), evidence of one declination every three calendar years is required before renewal of an association policy.
    
    (b)  A property and casualty agent must submit an application for initial insurance coverage on behalf of the applicant on forms prescribed by the association.   An application for initial coverage must contain:
    
    (1)  a statement as to whether the applicant has submitted or will submit the required premium payment from personal funds or, if not, to whom a balance is or will be due; and
    
    (2)  a statement that the agent acting on behalf of the applicant possesses proof of the declination described by Subsection (a) and proof of flood insurance coverage or unavailability of that coverage as described by Section [2210.203](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=2210.203)(a-1).

    Sec. 2210.203.  ISSUANCE OF COVERAGE; TERM; RENEWAL.  (a)  If the association determines that the property for which an application for initial insurance coverage is made is insurable property, the association, on payment of the premium in full or in part as authorized under Section [2210.2032](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=2210.2032), shall direct the issuance of an insurance policy as provided by the plan of operation.
    
    (a-1)  This subsection applies only to a structure constructed, altered, remodeled, or enlarged on or after September 1, 2009, and only for insurable property located in areas designated by the commissioner.  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), if all or any part of the property to which this subsection applies is located in Zone V or another similar zone with an additional hazard associated with storm waves, as defined by the National Flood Insurance Program, and if flood insurance under that federal program is available, the association may not issue an insurance policy for initial or renewal coverage unless evidence that the property is covered by a flood insurance policy is submitted to the association.  An agent offering or selling a Texas windstorm and hail insurance policy in any area designated by the commissioner under this subsection shall offer flood insurance coverage to the prospective insured, if that coverage is available.
    
    (b)  A policy issued under this section is for a one-year term.
    
    (c)  A policy may be renewed annually as long as the property continues to be insurable property.
    
    (c-1)  With the advice of the association, the commissioner shall adopt rules establishing a grace period of not more than 10 days after the due date for the receipt of payment of premium for the renewal of a policy.
    
    (d)  The commissioner, after receiving a recommendation from the board of directors, shall approve a commission structure for payment of an agent who submits an application for coverage to the association on behalf of a person who has an insurable interest in insurable property.  The commission structure adopted by the commissioner must be fair and reasonable, taking into consideration the amount of work performed by an agent in submitting an application to the association and the prevailing commission structure in the private windstorm market.

    (d)  If an insured requests cancellation of the insurance coverage, the association shall refund the unearned premium only if the cancellation was for one of the following reasons:

    (3)  total loss of the insured property; or

    (d)  A structure constructed, altered, remodeled, enlarged, or repaired or to which additions were made before January 1, 1988, that is located in an area that was governed at the time of the construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, repair, or addition by a building code recognized by the association is insurable property eligible for windstorm and hail insurance coverage from the association without compliance with the inspection or approval requirements of this section or the plan of operation.
    
    (e)  A structure constructed, altered, remodeled, enlarged, or repaired or to which additions were made before January 1, 1988, that is located in an area not governed by a building code recognized by the association is insurable property eligible for windstorm and hail insurance coverage from the association without compliance with the inspection or approval requirements of this section or the plan of operation if the structure was previously insured by an insurer authorized to engage in the business of insurance in this state and the structure is in essentially the same condition as when previously insured, except for normal wear and tear, and is without any structural change other than a change made according to code.  For purposes of this subsection, evidence of previous insurance coverage must reflect coverage for the perils of windstorm and hail for the property within the 12-month period immediately preceding the date of the application for coverage through the association and includes:
    
    (1)  a copy of a previous insurance policy;
    
    (2)  copies of canceled checks or agent's records that show payments for previous policies; and
    
    (3)  a copy of the title to the structure or mortgage company records that show previous policies.
    
    (f)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, insurance coverage for a residential structure may be issued or renewed through the association subject to the inspection requirements imposed under Section [2210.258](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=2210.258), if applicable.

The surcharge under this subsection applies to each policy issued or renewed by the association on or after the effective date of Sections 5 through 49, H.B. No. 4409, Acts of the 81st Legislature, Regular Session, 2009, and is due on the issuance or renewal of the policy.

    Sec. 2210.574.  DISPUTES CONCERNING AMOUNT OF ACCEPTED COVERAGE.  (a)  If  the association accepts coverage for a claim in full and a claimant disputes only the amount of loss the association will pay for the claim, or if the association accepts coverage for a claim in part and a claimant disputes the amount of loss the association will pay for the accepted portion of the claim, the claimant may request from the association a detailed summary of the manner in which the association determined the amount of loss the association will pay.
    
    (b)  If a claimant disputes the amount of loss the association will pay for a claim or a portion of a claim, the claimant, not later than the 60th day after the date the claimant receives the notice described by Section [2210.573](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=2210.573)(d)(1) or (2), may demand appraisal in accordance with the terms of the association policy.
    
    (c)  If a claimant, on a showing of good cause and not later than the 15th day after the expiration of the 60-day period described by Subsection (b), requests in writing that the 60-day period be extended, the association may grant an additional 30-day period in which the claimant may demand appraisal.
    
    (d)  If a claimant demands appraisal under this section:
    
    (1)  the appraisal must be conducted as provided by the association policy;
    
    (2)  the claimant and the association are responsible in equal shares for paying any costs incurred or charged in connection with the appraisal, including a fee charged under Subsection (e); and
    
    (3)  the appraisal must be completed within the period established under Subsection (d-1).
    
    (d-1)  In consultation with the association, the commissioner shall adopt rules establishing the period in which an appraisal demanded under this section must be completed.  In adopting the rules, the commissioner shall:
    
    (1)  allow flexibility for an adequate investigation of the claim that is the subject of the appraisal; and
    
    (2)  consider the time necessary to preserve the independence of the appraisers.
    
    (e)  If a claimant demands appraisal under this section and the appraiser retained by the claimant and the appraiser retained by the association are able to agree on an appraisal umpire to participate in the resolution of the dispute, the appraisal umpire is the umpire chosen by the two appraisers.  If the appraiser retained by the claimant and the appraiser retained by the association are unable to agree on an appraisal umpire to participate in the resolution of the dispute, the commissioner shall select an appraisal umpire from a roster of qualified umpires maintained by the department.  The department may:
    
    (1)  require appraisers to register with the department as a condition of being placed on the roster of umpires; and
    
    (2)  charge a reasonable registration fee to defray the cost incurred by the department in maintaining the roster and the commissioner in selecting an appraisal umpire under this subsection.
    
    (f)  Except as provided by Subsection (g), the appraisal decision is binding on the claimant and the association as to the amount of loss the association will pay for a fully accepted claim or the accepted portion of a partially accepted claim and is not appealable or otherwise reviewable.  A claimant that does not demand appraisal before the expiration of the periods described by Subsections (b) and (c) waives the claimant's right to contest the association's determination of the amount of loss the association will pay with reference to a fully accepted claim or the accepted portion of a partially accepted claim.
    
    (g)  A claimant or the association may, not later than the second anniversary of the date of an appraisal decision, file an action in a district court in the county in which the loss that is the subject of the appraisal occurred to vacate the appraisal decision and begin a new appraisal process if:
    
    (1)  the appraisal decision was obtained by corruption, fraud, or other undue means;
    
    (2)  the rights of the claimant or the association were prejudiced by:
    
    (A)  evident partiality by an appraisal umpire;
    
    (B)  corruption in an appraiser or appraisal umpire; or
    
    (C)  misconduct or wilful misbehavior of an appraiser or appraisal umpire; or
    
    (3)  an appraiser or appraisal umpire:
    
    (A)  exceeded the appraiser's or appraisal umpire's powers;
    
    (B)  refused to postpone the appraisal after a showing of sufficient cause for the postponement;
    
    (C)  refused to consider evidence material to the claim; or
    
    (D)  conducted the appraisal in a manner that substantially prejudiced the rights of the claimant or the association.
    
    (h)  Except as provided by Subsection (g), a claimant may not bring an action against the association with reference to a claim for which the association has accepted coverage in full.

    (b)  If a claimant provides notice of intent to bring an action under Subsection (a), the association may require the claimant, as a prerequisite to filing the action against the association, to submit the dispute to alternative dispute resolution by mediation or moderated settlement conference, as provided by Chapter [154](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=154), Civil Practice and Remedies Code.  A claimant that does not provide notice of intent to bring an action before the expiration of the period described by Subsection (a) waives the claimant's right to contest the association's partial or full denial of coverage and is barred from bringing an action against the association concerning the denial of coverage.
    
    (c)  The association must request alternative dispute resolution of a dispute described by Subsection (b) not later than the 60th day after the date the association receives from the claimant notice of intent to bring an action.
    
    (d)  Alternative dispute resolution under this section must be completed not later than the 60th day after the date a request for alternative dispute resolution is made under Subsection (c).  The 60-day period described by this subsection may be extended by the commissioner by rule in accordance with Section [2210.581](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=2210.581) or by the association and a claimant by mutual consent.
    
    (e)  If the claimant is not satisfied after completion of alternative dispute resolution, or if alternative dispute resolution is not completed before the expiration of the 60-day period described by Subsection (d) or any extension under that subsection, the claimant may bring an action against the association in a district court in the county in which the loss that is the subject of the coverage denial occurred. An action brought under this subsection shall be presided over by a judge appointed by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation designated under Section [74.161](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=74.161), Government Code.  A judge appointed under this section must be an active judge, as defined by Section [74.041](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=74.041), Government Code, who is a resident of the county in which the loss that is the basis of the disputed denied coverage occurred or of a first tier coastal county or a second tier coastal county adjacent to the county in which that loss occurred.
    
    (f)  If a claimant brings an action against the association concerning a partial or full denial of coverage, the court shall abate the action until the notice of intent to bring an action has been provided and, if requested by the association, the dispute has been submitted to alternative dispute resolution, in accordance with this section.
    
    (g)  A moderated settlement conference under this section may be conducted by a panel consisting of one or more impartial third parties.
    
    (h)  If the association requests mediation under this section, the claimant and the association are responsible in equal shares for paying any costs incurred or charged in connection with the mediation.
    
    (i)  If the association requests mediation under this section, and the claimant and the association are able to agree on a mediator, the mediator is the mediator agreed to by the claimant and the association.  If the claimant and the association are unable to agree on a mediator, the commissioner shall select a mediator from a roster of qualified mediators maintained by the department.  The department may:
    
    (1)  require mediators to register with the department as a condition of being placed on the roster; and
    
    (2)  charge a reasonable registration fee to defray the cost incurred by the department in maintaining the roster and the commissioner in selecting a mediator under this section.
    
    (j)  The commissioner shall establish rules to implement this section, including provisions for expediting alternative dispute resolution, facilitating the ability of a claimant to appear with or without counsel, establishing qualifications necessary for mediators to be placed on the roster maintained by the department under Subsection (i), and providing that formal rules of evidence shall not apply to the proceedings.
