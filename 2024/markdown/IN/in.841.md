    (b)  A ceding insurer may not be deemed to have an unfair advantage if the pricing of the policies and contracts reinsured by the limited purpose subsidiary life insurance company reflects, at the time the policies and contracts were issued, a reasonable long-term estimate of the cost to the ceding insurer of an alternative third-party transaction, and uses current pricing assumptions.
    
    (c)  The ceding insurer shall keep documentation between examinations that sets forth the manner in which a senior actuarial officer arrived at the conclusions in the certification.
