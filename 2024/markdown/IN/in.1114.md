    (d)  On receipt of a request to borrow, surrender, or withdraw any policy values, the existing insurer shall send a notice advising the policy owner that the release of policy values may affect the guaranteed elements, nonguaranteed elements, face amount, or surrender value of the policy from which the values are released.  The notice must be sent separately from the payment if the payment is sent to any person other than the policy owner. In the case of consecutive automatic premium loans, the insurer is only required to send the notice at the time of the first loan.

    Sec. 1114.055.  DUTIES OF INSURERS REGARDING DIRECT RESPONSE SOLICITATIONS.  (a)  In the case of an application initiated as a result of a direct response solicitation, the insurer shall require submission of a statement asking whether the applicant, by applying for the proposed policy or contract, intends to replace, discontinue, or change an existing policy or contract.  The statement may be included with,  or submitted as part of, each completed application for a policy or contract.  If the applicant indicates a replacement or change is not intended or if the applicant fails to respond to the statement, the insurer shall send the applicant, with the policy or contract, a notice, in a form adopted or approved by the commissioner, regarding replacement.
    
    (b)  If the insurer has proposed the replacement or if the applicant indicates a replacement is intended and the insurer continues with the replacement, the insurer shall:
    
    (1)  provide to the applicant or prospective applicant, with the policy or contract, a notice adopted or approved by the commissioner; and
    
    (2)  comply with the requirements of:
    
    (A)  Section [1114.053](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1114.053)(c), if the applicant furnishes the names of the existing insurers; and
    
    (B)  Sections [1114.053](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1114.053)(d), (e), and (f).
    
    (c)  In a situation described by Subsection (b)(1), the insurer may use a notice that deletes references to the agent, including the agent's signature, and references not applicable to the product being sold or replaced, without having to obtain prior approval of the notice from the commissioner. The insurer's obligation to obtain the applicant's signature is satisfied if the insurer can demonstrate that the insurer has made a diligent effort to secure a signed copy of the notice. The requirement to make a diligent effort is deemed satisfied if the insurer includes in the mailing a self-addressed postage prepaid envelope with instructions for the return of the signed notice.

    Sec. 1114.101.  UNFAIR METHOD OF COMPETITION; SANCTIONS AND PENALTIES.  (a)  A failure by an insurer or agent to comply with this chapter constitutes a violation of Chapter [541](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=541) and is subject to sanctions and penalties as provided by that chapter. For purposes of this section, examples of violations include:
    
    (1)  deceptive or misleading information set forth in any sales material;
    
    (2)  failing to ask the applicant in completing the application the pertinent questions regarding the possibility of financing or replacement;
    
    (3)  intentionally recording an answer incorrectly;
    
    (4)  advising an applicant to respond negatively to any question regarding replacement in order to prevent notice to the existing insurer; or
    
    (5)  advising a policy or contract owner to contact the insurer directly in such a way as to attempt to obscure the identity of the replacing agent or insurer.
    
    (b)  A policy or contract owner has the right to replace an existing life insurance policy or annuity contract after indicating in or as a part of applications for new coverage that replacement is not the intention.  However, patterns of that  action by policy or contract owners of the same agent shall be deemed prima facie evidence of the agent's knowledge that replacement was intended in connection with the identified transactions, and those patterns of action shall be deemed prima facie evidence of the agent's intent to violate this chapter.
    
    (c)  If it is determined that the requirements of this chapter have not been met, the replacing insurer shall provide to the policy owner:
    
    (1)  an in force illustration or, if an in force illustration is not available, a policy summary for the replacement policy or an available disclosure document for the replacement contract; and
    
    (2)  the appropriate notice regarding replacements.

    (1)  make restitution in the manner provided by Section [82.053](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=82.053);
