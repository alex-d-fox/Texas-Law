However, if the insurer or authorized agent requires an application for reinstatement and issues a conditional receipt for the premium tendered, the policy will be reinstated on approval of the application by the insurer or, if the application is not approved, on the 45th day after the date of the conditional receipt unless the insurer before that date has notified the insured in writing of the insurer's disapproval of the application.  The reinstated policy covers only loss resulting from an accidental injury sustained after the date of reinstatement and loss due to sickness that begins more than 10 days after the date of reinstatement.  In all other respects the insured and insurer have the same rights under the reinstated policy as they had under the policy immediately before the due date of the defaulted premium, subject to any provisions endorsed in the policy or attached to the policy in connection with the reinstatement.  Any premium accepted in connection with a reinstatement shall be applied to a period for which premium has not been previously paid, but not to any period more than 60 days before the date of reinstatement."

For a claim for any other loss, a written proof of loss must be provided to the insurer at the insurer's designated office before the 91st day after the date of the loss.
