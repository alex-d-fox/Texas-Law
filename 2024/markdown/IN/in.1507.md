    Sec. 1507.001.  PURPOSE.

The legislature, therefore, seeks to increase the availability of health insurance coverage by allowing insurers authorized to engage in the business of insurance in this state to issue accident and sickness policies that, in whole or in part, do not offer or provide state-mandated health benefits.
