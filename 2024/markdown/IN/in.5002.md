    TITLE 15.  INTERSTATE INSURANCE COMPACTS
    
      
    
    
    CHAPTER 5002.  INTERSTATE HEALTH CARE COMPACT
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 5002.001.  EXECUTION OF COMPACT.  This state enacts the Interstate Health Care Compact and enters into the compact with all other states legally joining in the compact in substantially the following form:
    
    Whereas, the separation of powers, both between the branches of the Federal government and between Federal and State authority, is essential to the preservation of individual liberty;
    
      
    
    
    Whereas, the Constitution creates a Federal government of limited and enumerated powers, and reserves to the States or to the people those powers not granted to the Federal government;
    
      
    
    
    Whereas, the Federal government has enacted many laws that have preempted State laws with respect to Health Care, and placed increasing strain on State budgets, impairing other responsibilities such as education, infrastructure, and public safety;
    
      
    
    
    Whereas, the Member States seek to protect individual liberty and personal control over Health Care decisions, and believe the best method to achieve these ends is by vesting regulatory authority over Health Care in the States;
    
      
    
    
    Whereas, by acting in concert, the Member States may express and inspire confidence in the ability of each Member State to govern Health Care effectively; and
    
      
    
    
    Whereas, the Member States recognize that consent of Congress may be more easily secured if the Member States collectively seek consent through an interstate compact;
    
      
    
    
    NOW THEREFORE, the Member States hereto resolve, and by the adoption into law under their respective State Constitutions of this Health Care Compact, agree, as follows:

    (f)  The Commission shall not take any action within a Member State that contravenes any State law of that Member State.
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 7.  Congressional Consent.  This Compact shall be effective on its adoption by at least two Member States and consent of the United States Congress.  This Compact shall be effective unless the United States Congress, in consenting to this Compact, alters the fundamental purposes of this Compact, which are:
    
      
    
    
    (a)  To secure the right of the Member States to regulate Health Care in their respective States pursuant to this Compact and to suspend the operation of any conflicting federal laws, rules, regulations, and orders within their States; and
    
      
    
    
    (b)  To secure Federal funding for Member States that choose to invoke their authority under this Compact, as prescribed by Section 5 above.
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 8.  Amendments.  The Member States, by unanimous agreement, may amend this Compact from time to time without the prior consent or approval of Congress and any amendment shall be effective unless, within one year, the Congress disapproves that amendment.  Any State may join this Compact after the date on which Congress consents to the Compact by adoption into law under its State Constitution.
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 9.  Withdrawal; Dissolution.  Any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by adopting a law to that effect, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until six months after the Governor of the withdrawing Member State has given notice of the withdrawal to the other Member States.  A withdrawing State shall be liable for any obligations that it may have incurred prior to the date on which its withdrawal becomes effective.  This Compact shall be dissolved upon the withdrawal of all but one of the Member States.
