    Sec. 2701.001.  ABSTRACT OF TITLE DISTINGUISHED;  PROHIBITION ON REGULATION OF ABSTRACT OF TITLE.  (a)  In this section, "commitment for title insurance" means a title insurance form under which a title insurance company offers to issue a title insurance policy subject to stated exceptions, requirements, and terms.  The term includes a mortgagee title policy binder on an interim construction loan.
    
    (b)  A commitment for title insurance constitutes a statement of the terms and conditions on which a title insurance company is willing to issue its policy.  A title insurance policy or other title insurance form constitutes a statement of the terms and conditions of the indemnity under the policy or form.
    
    (c)  An abstract of title prepared from an abstract plant for a chain of title to real property described in the abstract of title is not title insurance, a commitment for title insurance, or any other title insurance form.  A commitment for title insurance, title insurance policy, or other title insurance form is not an abstract of title.
    
    (d)  The commissioner may not adopt rules relating to abstracts of title.
