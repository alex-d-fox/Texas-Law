    Sec. 2254.003. REFUND OR DISCOUNT BASED ON EXCESSIVE OR UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATORY PREMIUM RATES.  (a)  This section applies to a rate for personal automobile insurance or residential property insurance filed on or after the effective date of Chapter 206, Acts of the 78th Legislature, Regular Session, 2003.
    
    (b)  Except as provided by Section [2254.004](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=2254.004)(c), if the commissioner determines that an insurer has charged a rate for personal automobile insurance or residential property insurance that is excessive or unfairly discriminatory, as described by Section [2251.051](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=2251.051), the commissioner may:
    
    (1)  order the insurer to refund directly to each affected policyholder the portion of the premium, plus interest on that amount, that is excessive or unfairly discriminatory, if that portion of the premium is at least 7.5 percent of the total premium charged for the coverage; or
    
    (2)  if that portion of the premium is less than 7.5 percent of the total premium, order the insurer to provide, to each affected policyholder:
    
    (A)  who renews the policy, a future premium discount equal to the amount of the excessive or unfairly discriminatory portion of the premium, plus interest on that amount; and
    
    (B)  who does not renew or whose coverage is otherwise terminated, a refund in the amount described by Subdivision (1).
    
    (c)  The rate for interest assessed under Subsection (b) is the lesser of 18 percent or the sum of six percent and the prime rate for the calendar year in which the commissioner's order finding that the rate is excessive or unfairly discriminatory is issued.  For purposes of this subsection, the prime rate is the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal for the first day of the calendar year that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.  The period for the refund and interest begins on the date the department first provides the insurer with formal written notice that the insurer's filed rate is excessive or unfairly discriminatory, and interest continues to accrue until the refund is paid.  An insurer may not be required to pay any interest penalty if the insurer prevails in an appeal of the commissioner's order under Subchapter D, Chapter [36](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=36).
    
    (d)  An insurer may not claim a premium tax credit to which the insurer is otherwise entitled unless the insurer complies with Subsection (b).
