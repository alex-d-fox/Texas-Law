    Sec. 4003.001.  LICENSE EXPIRATION.  (a)  Unless a staggered renewal system is adopted under Section [4003.002](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=4003.002), each license issued or renewed by the department under Chapter [981](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=981) or Subtitle A, B, or C and not suspended or revoked by the commissioner expires on:

    (2)  except as provided in Subsection (c):
    
    (A)  for a license issued or renewed in an even-numbered year, the individual license holder's birthday each even-numbered year; or
    
    (B)  for a license issued or renewed in an odd-numbered year, the individual license holder's birthday each odd-numbered year.
    
    (b)  The commissioner by rule may change the two-year expiration period if the commissioner determines that the change is necessary to promote uniformity of license periods of this state with those of other states.
    
    (c)  If a person holds more than one license, all licenses issued to the person expire on the earliest expiration date of the licenses held.  Thereafter, all licenses expire in accordance with Subsection (a).
    
    (d)  Notwithstanding Section [4003.002](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=4003.002)(b), the commissioner may not prorate the initial application fee for a license based on the expiration period of the license under Subsection (c).
