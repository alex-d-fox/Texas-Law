The agent may place varying levels of importance on each of those factors based on the facts and circumstances of a particular case, but may not consider one factor in isolation.
    
    (d)  In the case of an exchange or replacement of an annuity, the agent shall consider the whole transaction, including whether:

    (2)  any riders and similar product enhancements.
    
    (f)  An agent shall be held to standards applicable to an agent with similar authority and licensure with respect to the requirements of this section.  This section does not create a fiduciary obligation or relationship and only creates a regulatory obligation.  This section does not affect any ongoing monitoring obligation an agent may have under a fiduciary, consulting, investment advising, or financial planning agreement between the consumer and the agent.

    (b)  Each insurer shall establish and maintain a supervision system that is reasonably designed to achieve the insurer's and the insurer's agent's compliance with this chapter, including:
    
    (1)  establishing and maintaining reasonable procedures to inform the insurer's agents of the requirements of this chapter and incorporating the requirements of this chapter into relevant agent training manuals;
    
    (2)  establishing and maintaining standards for agent product training and establishing and maintaining reasonable procedures to require the insurer's agents to comply with the requirements of Section [1115.056](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1115.056);
    
    (3)  providing product-specific training and training materials that explain all material features of the insurer's annuity products to the insurer's agents;
    
    (4)  establishing and maintaining procedures to review each recommendation electronically, physically, or otherwise before the issuance of an annuity that:
    
    (A)  are designed to ensure that there is a reasonable basis to determine that the recommended annuity would effectively address the consumer's financial situation, insurance needs, and financial objectives; and
    
    (B)  may:
    
    (i)  include the application of a screening system to identify selected transactions for additional review; and
    
    (ii)  be designed to require additional review only of those transactions identified for additional review by the selection criteria;

    (b-1)  Subsection (b)(8) does not prohibit the receipt by employees of health insurance, office rent, office support, retirement benefits, or other employee benefits so long as those benefits are not based on the volume of sales of a specific annuity within a limited period of time.
    
    (c)  This subsection and Subsection (c-1) do not prohibit an insurer from contracting for the performance of a function, including maintenance of procedures, required by Subsection (b).  An insurer is responsible for taking appropriate corrective action and may be subject to sanctions and penalties under Section [1115.102](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1115.102) regardless of whether the insurer contracts for performance of a function and regardless of whether the insurer complies with Subsection (c-1).
