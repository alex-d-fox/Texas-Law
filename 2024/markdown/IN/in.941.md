(a)  Except as provided by Subsection (c), a Lloyd's plan may not assume or write insurance risks in this state, for residents of this state, or covering property located in this state that produce an amount of net premium income that exceeds 10 times the value of the net assets of the underwriters.
    
    (b)  If the insurance risks written or assumed by a Lloyd's plan produce a net premium income that exceeds the limit specified by Subsection (a), the Lloyd's plan may not write or assume an additional insurance risk until the net assets have been increased to a level that brings the net premium income produced by the additional insurance risk within that limit.
    
    (c)  The limit imposed by Subsection (a) does not apply to a Lloyd's plan if:
    
    (1)  the Lloyd's plan's net assets equal at least the amount of money required of a stock insurance company engaged in the same kind of business in this state;  or
    
    (2)  the department determines that the Lloyd's plan, through reinsurance or other contracts with other responsible and solvent insurers, has reduced the net lines at risk carried by the Lloyd's plan so that its operations are safe and its solvency is not in danger.
    
    (d)  An attorney in fact for a Lloyd's plan may not assume an insurance risk that exceeds one-tenth of the sum of the amount of the net assets of the underwriters as described in this subchapter and the amount of the additional liability assumed by the individual underwriters in the articles of agreement and in policies or contracts of insurance, unless the excess insurance risk is promptly reinsured.
