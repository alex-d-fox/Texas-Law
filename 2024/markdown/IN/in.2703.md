    (e)  The commissioner may not prescribe an owner title insurance policy form for residential real property or an endorsement to the policy if the policy form or endorsement is not written in plain language.  For purposes of this subsection, a policy form or endorsement is written in plain language if it achieves the minimum score established by the commissioner on the Flesch reading ease test or an equivalent test selected by the commissioner or, at the commissioner's option, if it conforms to the language requirements in a National Association of Insurance Commissioners model act relating to plain language.  This subsection does not apply to policy language required by state or federal law.
    
    (f)  For an owner title insurance policy on residential real property that is issued to an individual, the commissioner may adopt coverages that insure against ad valorem taxes, including penalties and interest, to be paid with respect to the property for a previous tax year:
    
    (1)  that are delinquent on the effective date of the policy because of sale, diversion, or change of use, unless excluded because the insured has actual knowledge of the delinquent taxes;  or
    
    (2)  that result from an exemption granted to a previous owner of the property under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13), Tax Code, or from an improvement not assessed for a previous tax year, unless excluded because the insured has actual knowledge of the taxes.
    
    (g)  For an owner's title insurance policy on residential real property that is issued to an individual, the commissioner shall adopt terms that provide for continuation of coverage subject to rights and defenses against the original named insured for:
    
    (1)  a person who inherits the original named insured's title on the original named insured's death;
    
    (2)  the original named insured's spouse who receives title in a dissolution of marriage with the original named insured;
    
    (3)  the trustee or successor of a trust established by the original named insured to whom the original named insured transfers title after the date of policy; or
    
    (4)  the beneficiaries of a trust described by Subdivision (3) on the death of the original named insured.

    (b)  The commissioner may not fix or promulgate the premium rates for reinsurance between title insurance companies.  Title insurance companies may establish the premium rates in amounts to which the companies agree.
    
    (c)  Except for a premium charged for reinsurance, a premium may not be charged for a title insurance policy or for another prescribed or approved form at a rate different than the rate fixed and promulgated by the commissioner.

    Sec. 2703.152.  FACTORS CONSIDERED IN FIXING PREMIUM RATES.  (a)  In fixing premium rates, the commissioner shall consider all relevant income and expenses of title insurance companies and title insurance agents attributable to engaging in the business of title insurance in this state.
    
    (b)  The premium rates fixed by the commissioner must be:
    
    (1)  reasonable as to the public;  and

    Sec. 2703.153.  COLLECTION OF DATA FOR FIXING PREMIUM RATES; ANNUAL STATISTICAL REPORT.

    (1)  loss experience;
    
    (2)  expense of operation; and
    
    (3)  other material matters.
    
    (b)  The information must be submitted in the form prescribed by the department.
    
    (c)  Not less frequently than once every five years, the commissioner shall evaluate the information required under this section to determine whether the department needs additional or different information or no longer needs certain information to promulgate rates.  If the department requires a title insurance company or title insurance agent to include new or different information in the statistical report, that information may be considered by the commissioner in fixing premium rates if the information collected is reasonably credible for the purposes for which the information is to be used.
    
    (d)  A title insurance company or a title insurance agent aggrieved by a department requirement concerning the submission of information may bring a suit in a district court in Travis County alleging that the request for information:
    
    (1)  is unduly burdensome; or
    
    (2)  is not a request for information material to fixing and promulgating premium rates or another matter that may be the subject of the periodic hearing and is not a request reasonably designed to lead to the discovery of that information.
    
    (e)  On filing of a suit under Subsection (d), the requirement that the title insurance company or title insurance agent bringing the suit comply with the request for the information is abated as to that title insurance company or title insurance agent. The district court may enter an order requiring the title insurance company or title insurance agent to comply with the request for information subject to the limitations, if any, imposed by the court.
    
    (f)  A title insurance company or title insurance agent must bring suit under Subsection (d) not later than the 30th day after the date the company or agent receives the request for information from the department.
    
    (g)  This section may not be construed to limit the department's authority to request information under Section [38.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=38.001) or other applicable provisions of this code.
    
    (h)  The contents of the statistical report, including any amendments to the statistical report, must be established in a rulemaking hearing under Subchapter [B](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001.021), Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code.
