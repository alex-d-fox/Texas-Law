    SUBTITLE C. DELINQUENT INSURERS
    
      
    
    
    CHAPTER 441.  SUPERVISION AND CONSERVATORSHIP
    
      
    
    
    SUBCHAPTER A.  GENERAL PROVISIONS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 441.001.  FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  (a)  An insurer delinquency, or the state's inability to properly proceed in a threatened delinquency, directly or indirectly affects other insurers by creating a lack of public confidence in insurance and insurers.  Insurer delinquencies destroy public confidence in the state's ability to regulate insurers.  The harmful results of insurer delinquencies, including those described by this subsection, are properly minimized by laws designed to protect and assist insureds, creditors, and owners.
    
    (b)  Placing an insurer in receivership often destroys or diminishes, or is likely to destroy or diminish, the value of the insurer's assets, including:
    
    (1)  the insurer's insurance account or in-force business;
    
    (2)  the insurer as a going concern; and
    
    (3)  the insurer's agency force.
    
    (c)  The value of the assets described by Subsection (b) should be preserved if the circumstances of the insurer's financial condition warrant an attempt to rehabilitate or conserve the insurer and the rehabilitation or conservation is otherwise feasible.
    
    (d)  It is a proper concern of this state and proper policy to attempt to correct or remedy insurer misconduct, ineptness, or misfortune.
    
    (e)  The purpose of this chapter is to:
    
    (1)  provide for the rehabilitation and conservation of insurers by authorizing and requiring supervision and conservatorship by the commissioner;
    
    (2)  authorize action to determine whether an attempt should be made to rehabilitate and conserve an insurer;
    
    (3)  avoid, if possible and feasible, the necessity of placing an insurer under temporary or permanent receivership;
    
    (4)  provide for the protection of an insurer's assets pending determination of whether the insurer may be successfully rehabilitated; and
    
    (5)  alleviate concerns regarding insurance and insurers.
    
    (f)  Rehabilitation of an insurer might not be accomplished in every case, but this chapter facilitates and directs an attempt to rehabilitate an insurer without immediate resort to the harsher remedy of receivership.  If receivership becomes necessary, the preliminary supervision and conservatorship may prevent a dissipation of assets, which will benefit policyholders, creditors, and owners.
    
    (g)  For the reasons stated by this section, the substance and procedures of this chapter are the public policy of this state and are necessary to the public welfare.  That policy and welfare require the availability of this chapter and the application of this chapter if circumstances warrant.
    
    (h)  This chapter provides, in conjunction with other law, a generally ordered sequence, and provides for review at each step, of supervision, concurrent conservatorship and rehabilitation, including reinsurance, and cessation of the conservatorship by rehabilitation or by receivership and liquidation if at any time that cessation is indicated or determined to be appropriate.
