(a)  To permit the receiver or association to properly defend a pending cause of action, a proceeding in which an impaired title insurance company is a party or is obligated to defend a party in a court in this state, other than a proceeding directly related to the receivership or instituted by the receiver, is stayed for:
    
    (1)  a six-month period beginning on the later of the date of the designation of impairment or the date an ancillary proceeding is brought in this state;  and
    
    (2)  any subsequent period as determined by the court.
    
    (b)  If a covered claim arises from a judgment, order, verdict, finding, or other decision based on the default of an impaired title insurance company or its failure to defend an insured, the association on its own behalf or on behalf of the insured may apply to the court or administrator that made the decision to have the decision set aside and may defend the claim on its merits.
    
    (c)  In a proceeding considering a covered claim, a judgment against an insured taken after the date the delinquency proceeding or supervision begins or a conservator is appointed is not evidence of liability or of the amount of damages, and a default or consent judgment against an insured or the impaired title insurance company or a settlement, release, or judgment entered into by the insured or the impaired title insurance company does not bind the association and is not evidence of liability or of the amount of damages in connection with a claim brought against the association or another party under this chapter.

    (2)  has repaid in full the amount of guaranty fees paid by the association.

    (c)  A person who was an affiliate that controlled the title insurance company when the distribution described by Subsection (b) was paid is liable for the amount of the distribution received.

    (1)  the distribution was lawful and reasonable on the date of payment;  and
