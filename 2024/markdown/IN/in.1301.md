    (B)  more than a total of four times within a 21-year period for each county in a service area for issues that may be remedied through good faith efforts; and
    
    (6)  authorize the commissioner to issue a waiver that would otherwise be unavailable under Subdivision (5) if the waiver request demonstrates, and the department confirms annually, that there are no uncontracted physicians or health care providers in the area to meet the specific standard for a county in a service area.

    (c)  Subsection (b)(6) does not apply to an exclusive provider benefit plan if the plan has:
    
    (1)  contracted with preferred provider hospitals in sufficient number capable of meeting the covered inpatient and outpatient health care benefits for current and actuarially projected utilization in accordance with Subsection (b)(3); or
    
    (2)  received a waiver under Subsection (a).

    Sec. 1301.0056.  EXAMINATIONS AND FEES.  (a)  The commissioner shall by rule adopt a process for the commissioner to examine a preferred provider benefit plan before an insurer offers the plan for delivery to insureds to determine whether the plan meets the quality of care and network adequacy standards of this chapter.  An insurer may not offer a preferred provider benefit plan or an exclusive provider benefit plan before the commissioner determines that the network meets the quality of care and network adequacy standards of this chapter or the insurer receives a waiver under Section [1301.0055](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1301.0055).
    
    (a-1)  An insurer is subject to a qualifying examination of the insurer's preferred provider benefit plans and subsequent quality of care and network adequacy examinations by the commissioner at least once every three years, in connection with a public hearing under Section [1301.00565](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1301.00565) concerning a material deviation from network adequacy standards by a previously authorized plan or a request for a waiver of a network adequacy standard, and whenever the commissioner considers an examination necessary. Documentation provided to the commissioner during an examination conducted under this section is confidential and is not subject to disclosure as public information under Chapter [552](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552), Government Code.
    
    (b)  An insurer examined under this section shall pay the cost of the examination in an amount determined by the commissioner.
    
    (c)  The department shall collect an assessment in an amount determined by the commissioner from the insurer at the time of the examination to cover all expenses attributable directly to the examination, including the salaries and expenses of department employees and all reasonable expenses of the department necessary for the administration of this chapter.
    
    (d)  The department shall deposit an assessment collected under this section to the credit of the account described by Section [401.156](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=401.156)(a).  Money deposited under this subsection shall be used to pay the salaries and expenses of examiners and all other expenses relating to the examination of insurers under this section.
    
    (e)  Rules adopted under this section must require insurers to provide access to or submit data or information necessary for the commissioner to evaluate and make a determination of compliance with quality of care and network adequacy standards.  The rules must require insurers to provide access to or submit data or information that includes:
    
    (1)  a searchable and sortable database of network physicians and health care providers by national provider identifier, county, physician specialty, hospital privileges and credentials, and type of health care provider or licensure, as applicable;
    
    (2)  actuarial data of current and projected number of insureds by county;
    
    (3)  actuarial data of current and projected utilization of each preferred provider type listed in Section [1301.00553](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1301.00553) and described by Section [1301.00554](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1301.00554) by county; and

    (b)  The commissioner shall set a public hearing for a determination of whether there is good cause for a waiver when an insurer:
    
    (1)  requests a waiver that does not satisfy Section [1301.0055](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1301.0055)(a)(6);
    
    (2)  requests a waiver that the commissioner does not deny; and

    (c)  The commissioner shall notify affected physicians and health care providers that may be the subject of a discussion of good faith efforts on behalf of the insurer to meet network adequacy standards and provide the physicians and health care providers with an opportunity to submit evidence, including written testimony, and to attend the public hearing and offer testimony either in person or virtually.  An out-of-network physician or hospital, including a physician group or health care system referenced in the insurer's waiver request or notice of material deviation, may not be identified by name at the hearing unless the physician or hospital consents to the identification in advance of the hearing.
    
    (d)  At the hearing, the commissioner shall consider all written and oral testimony and evidence submitted by the insurer and the public pertinent to the requested waiver, including:
    
    (1)  the total number of physicians or health care providers in each preferred provider type listed in Section [1301.00553](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1301.00553) within the county and service area being submitted for the waiver and whether the insurer made a good faith effort to contract with those required preferred provider types to meet network adequacy standards of this chapter;
    
    (2)  the total number of facilities, and availability of pediatric, for-profit, nonprofit, tax-supported, and teaching facilities, within the county and service area being submitted for a waiver and whether the insurer made a good faith effort to contract with these facilities and facility-based physicians and health care providers to meet network adequacy standards of this chapter;
    
    (3)  population, density, and geographical information to determine the possibility of meeting travel time and distance requirements within the county and service area being submitted for a waiver; and
    
    (4)  availability of services, population, and density within the county and service area being submitted for the waiver.
    
    (e)  The commissioner may not consider a prohibition on balance billing in determining whether to grant a waiver from network adequacy standards.
    
    (f)  The commissioner may not grant a waiver without a public hearing.
    
    (g)  Except as provided by this subsection, any evidence submitted to the commissioner as evidence for the public hearing that is proprietary in nature is confidential and not subject to disclosure as public information under Chapter [552](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552), Government Code.  Information related to provider directories, credentials, and privileges, estimates of patient populations, and actuarial estimates of needed providers to meet the estimated patient population is not protected under this subsection.
    
    (h)  A policyholder is entitled to seek judicial review of the commissioner's decision to grant a waiver under this section in a Travis County district court.  Review by the district court under this subsection is de novo.

    Sec. 1301.0642.  CONTRACT PROVISIONS ALLOWING CERTAIN ADVERSE MATERIAL CHANGES PROHIBITED.  (a)  In this section, "adverse material change" means a change to a preferred provider contract with a physician, health care practitioner, or organization of physicians or health care practitioners that would decrease the preferred provider's payment or compensation, change the provider's tier to a less preferred tier, or change the administrative procedures in a way that may reasonably be expected to significantly increase the provider's administrative expenses or decrease the provider's payment or compensation.  The term does not include:
    
    (1)  a decrease in payment or compensation resulting solely from a change in a published governmental fee schedule on which the payment or compensation is based if the applicability of the schedule is clearly identified in the contract;
    
    (2)  a decrease in payment or compensation that was anticipated under the terms of the contract, if the amount and date of applicability of the decrease is clearly identified in the contract;
    
    (3)  an administrative change that may significantly increase the provider's administrative expense, the specific applicability of which is clearly identified in the contract;
    
    (4)  a change that is required by federal or state law;
    
    (5)  a termination for cause; or
    
    (6)  a termination without cause at the end of the term of the contract.
    
    (b)  An adverse material change to a preferred provider contract may only be made during the term of the preferred provider contract with the mutual agreement of the parties.  A provision in a preferred provider contract that allows the insurer to unilaterally make an adverse material change during the term of the contract is void and unenforceable.
    
    (c)  Any adverse material change to the preferred provider contract may not go into effect until the 120th day after the date the preferred provider affirmatively agrees to the adverse material change in writing.
    
    (d)  A proposed amendment by an insurer seeking an adverse material change to a preferred provider contract must include notice that clearly and conspicuously states that a preferred provider may choose to not agree to the amendment and that the decision to not agree to the amendment may not affect:
    
    (1)  the terms of the provider's existing contract with the insurer; or
    
    (2)  the provider's participation in other health plans or products.
    
    (e)  A preferred provider's failure to agree to an adverse material change to a preferred provider contract does not affect:
    
    (1)  the terms of the provider's existing contract with the insurer; or
    
    (2)  the provider's participation in other health care products or plans.
    
    (f)  An insurer's failure to include the notice described by Subsection (d) with the proposed amendment makes an otherwise agreed-to adverse material change void and unenforceable.
    
    (g)  This section does not apply to a preferred provider contract:
    
    (1)  with an unspecified and indefinite duration;
    
    (2)  with no stated or automatic renewal period or event; and
    
    (3)  that may only be terminated by notice from one party to the other.

    Sec. 1301.065.  SHIFTING OF INSURER'S TORT LIABILITY PROHIBITED.

    (1)  on behalf of an insured, reasonably filed a complaint against the insurer;  or
    
    (2)  appealed a decision of the insurer.

    (1)  regarding the patient's health care, including the patient's medical condition or treatment options;  or
    
    (2)  in good faith regarding the provisions, terms, requirements, or services of the health insurance policy as they relate to the patient's medical needs.
    
    (a-1)  An insurer may not, as a condition of payment with a physician or health care provider or in any other manner, require a physician or health care provider to provide a notification form stating that the physician or health care provider is an out-of-network provider to a current, prospective, or former patient, or a person designated by the patient, if the form contains additional information that is intended, or is otherwise required to be presented in a manner that is intended, to intimidate the patient.
    
    (b)  An insurer may not in any way penalize, terminate the participation of, or refuse to compensate for covered services a physician or health care provider for discussing or communicating with a current, prospective, or former patient, or a person designated by a patient, pursuant to this section.

    Sec. 1301.137.  VIOLATION OF CLAIMS PAYMENT REQUIREMENTS; PENALTY.  (a)  Except as provided by this section, if a clean claim submitted to an insurer is payable and the insurer does not determine under Subchapter C that the claim is payable and pay the claim on or before the date the insurer is required to make a determination or adjudication of the claim, the insurer shall pay the preferred provider making the claim the contracted rate owed on the claim plus a penalty in the amount of the lesser of:
    
    (1)  50 percent of the difference between the billed charges, as submitted on the claim, and the contracted rate; or
    
    (2)  $100,000.
    
    (b)  If the claim is paid on or after the 46th day and before the 91st day after the date the insurer is required to make a determination or adjudication of the claim, the insurer shall pay a penalty in the amount of the lesser of:
    
    (1)  100 percent of the difference between the billed charges, as submitted on the claim, and the contracted rate; or

    (c)  If the claim is paid on or after the 91st day after the date the insurer is required to make a determination or adjudication of the claim, the insurer shall pay a penalty computed under Subsection (b) plus 18 percent annual interest on that amount.  Interest under this subsection accrues beginning on the date the insurer was required to pay the claim and ending on the date the claim and the penalty are paid in full.
    
    (d)  Except as provided by this section, an insurer that determines under Subchapter C that a claim is payable, pays only a portion of the amount of the claim on or before the date the insurer is required to make a determination or adjudication of the claim, and pays the balance of the contracted rate owed for the claim after that date shall pay to the preferred provider, in addition to the contracted amount owed, a penalty on the amount not timely paid in the amount of the lesser of:
    
    (1)  50 percent of the underpaid amount; or
    
    (2)  $100,000.
    
    (e)  If the balance of the claim is paid on or after the 46th day and before the 91st day after the date the insurer is required to make a determination or adjudication of the claim, the insurer shall pay a penalty on the balance of the claim in the amount of the lesser of:
    
    (1)  100 percent of the underpaid amount; or
    
    (2)  $200,000.
    
    (f)  If the balance of the claim is paid on or after the 91st day after the date the insurer is required to make a determination or adjudication of the claim, the insurer shall pay a penalty on the balance of the claim computed under Subsection (e) plus 18 percent annual interest on that amount.  Interest under this subsection accrues beginning on the date the insurer was required to pay the claim and ending on the date the claim and the penalty are paid in full.
    
    (g)  For the purposes of Subsections (d) and (e), the underpaid amount is computed on the ratio of the amount underpaid on the contracted rate to the contracted rate as applied to an amount equal to the billed charges as submitted on the claim minus the contracted rate.
    
    (h)  An insurer is not liable for a penalty under this section:
    
    (1)  if the failure to pay the claim in accordance with Subchapter C is a result of a catastrophic event and:
    
    (A)  the commissioner published a notice allowing an extension of the applicable prompt payment deadlines due to the catastrophic event; or
    
    (B)  the department approved the insurer's request for an extension due to the substantial interference of the catastrophic event with the normal business operations of the insurer; or
    
    (2)  if the claim was paid in accordance with Subchapter C, but for less than the contracted rate, and:
    
    (A)  the preferred provider notifies the insurer of the underpayment after the 270th day after the date the underpayment was received; and
    
    (B)  the insurer pays the balance of the claim on or before the 30th day after the date the insurer receives the notice.
    
    (i)  Subsection (h) does not relieve the insurer of the obligation to pay the remaining unpaid contracted rate owed the preferred provider.
    
    (j)  An insurer that pays a penalty under this section shall clearly indicate on the explanation of payment statement in the manner prescribed by the commissioner by rule the amount of the contracted rate paid and the amount paid as a penalty.
    
    (k)  In addition to any other penalty or remedy authorized by this code, an insurer that violates Section [1301.103](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1301.103), [1301.104](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1301.104), or [1301.105](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1301.105) in processing more than two percent of clean claims submitted to the insurer is subject to an administrative penalty under Chapter [84](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=84).  For each day an administrative penalty is imposed under this subsection, the penalty may not exceed $1,000 for each claim that remains unpaid in violation of Section [1301.103](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1301.103), [1301.104](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1301.104), or [1301.105](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1301.105).  In determining whether an insurer has processed preferred provider claims in compliance with Section [1301.103](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1301.103), [1301.104](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1301.104), or [1301.105](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1301.105), the commissioner shall consider paid claims, other than claims that have been paid under Section [1301.105](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1301.105), and shall compute a compliance percentage for physician and provider claims, other than institutional provider claims, and a compliance percentage for institutional provider claims.
    
    (l)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, this subsection governs the payment of a penalty under this section.  For a penalty under this section relating to a clean claim submitted by a preferred provider other than an institutional provider, the insurer shall pay the entire penalty to the preferred provider, except for any interest computed under Subsection (c), which shall be paid to the Texas Health Insurance Risk Pool.  For a penalty under this section relating to a clean claim submitted by an institutional provider, the insurer shall pay 50 percent of the penalty amount computed under this section, including interest, to the institutional provider and the remaining 50 percent of that amount to the Texas Health Insurance Risk Pool.

    (1)  is based on:
    
    (A)  the amount initially determined payable by the insurer; or
