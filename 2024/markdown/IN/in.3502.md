    "NOTICE OF RIGHT TO CANCEL PRIVATE MORTGAGE INSURANCE:  If you currently pay private mortgage insurance premiums, you may have the right to cancel the insurance and cease paying premiums.  This would permit you to make a lower total monthly mortgage payment and to possibly receive a refund of any unearned premiums on the policy. In most cases, you have the right to cancel private mortgage insurance if the principal balance of your loan is 80 percent or less of the current fair market appraised value of your home.  If you want to learn whether you are eligible to cancel this insurance, please contact us at (address and telephone number of lender) or the Texas Department of Insurance consumer help line at (the appropriate toll-free telephone number)."
