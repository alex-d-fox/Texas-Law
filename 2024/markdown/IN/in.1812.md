(a)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this code relating to the delivery of policy forms, an insurer may elect to make a personal automobile, commercial automobile, inland marine, or residential property insurance policy available to an insured by posting a specimen policy on the insurer's Internet website instead of other authorized means.  An insurer making the election must comply with Section [1812.003](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1812.003).
    
    (b)  On request of and at no cost to an insured, an insurer shall provide to the insured a copy of a specimen policy applicable to the insured that is posted on the insurer's Internet website.
    
    (c)  The office of public insurance counsel may post an insurer's specimen policy on the office's Internet website.  The posting, other than a posting described by Subsection (a), of an insurer's specimen policy on an Internet website does not create a duty to comply with the requirements of this chapter.
