    Sec. 463.151.  MAKING AND PAYMENT OF ASSESSMENT.  (a)  The association shall assess member insurers, separately for each account under Section [463.105](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=463.105), in the amounts and at the times the board determines necessary to provide money for the association to exercise the association's powers, perform the association's duties, and carry out the purposes of this chapter.  The association may not authorize and call an assessment to meet the requirements of the association with respect to an impaired or insolvent insurer until the assessment is necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.  The board shall classify assessments under Section [463.152](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=463.152) and determine the amount of assessments with reasonable accuracy, recognizing that exact determinations may not always be possible.
    
    (a-1)  The association shall notify each member insurer of its anticipated pro rata share of an authorized assessment not yet called not later than the 180th day after the date the assessment is authorized.
    
    (b)  An assessment is due on the date the association specifies, which may not be earlier than the 30th day after the date the association gives written notice of the assessment to member insurers.  Interest accrues on an unpaid amount at a rate of 10 percent beginning on the due date.
    
    (c)  An insurer whose certificate of authority to engage in business in this state is revoked or surrendered remains liable for any unpaid assessment made before the date of the revocation or surrender.

    (1)  annual premium receipts;
    
    (2)  admitted assets; or
    
    (3)  insurance in force.
    
    (b)  Class B assessments on a member insurer for each account under Section [463.105](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=463.105) shall be authorized and called in the proportion that the premiums received on business in this state by the member insurer on policies or contracts covered by each account for the three most recent calendar years for which information is available preceding the year in which the impaired or insolvent member insurer became impaired or insolvent bear to premiums received on business in this state for those calendar years by all assessed member insurers.  Except for assessments related to long-term care insurance as described by Subsection (b-1), the amount of a Class B assessment shall be allocated among the separate accounts in accordance with an allocation formula that may be based on:
    
    (1)  the premiums or reserves of the impaired or insolvent insurer; or
    
    (2)  any other standard deemed by the board in the board's sole discretion as being fair and reasonable under the circumstances.
    
    (b-1)  The amount of a Class B assessment for long-term care insurance written by an impaired or insolvent member insurer shall be allocated according to a methodology included in the plan of operation and approved by the commissioner.  The methodology must provide for 50 percent of the assessment to be allocated to accident and health member insurers and 50 percent to be allocated to life and annuity member insurers.  This subsection does not apply to a rider to a member insurer's life insurance policy or annuity contract that provides long-term care benefits.
    
    (c)  The total amount of assessments on a member insurer for each account under Section [463.105](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=463.105) may not in one calendar year exceed two percent of the insurer's average annual premiums on the policies covered by the account during the three calendar years preceding the year in which the impaired or insolvent member insurer became an impaired or insolvent insurer.  If two or more assessments are authorized in a calendar year with respect to member insurers that become impaired or insolvent in different calendar years, the average annual premiums for purposes of the aggregate assessment percentage limitation described by this subsection shall be equal to the higher of the three-year average annual premiums for the applicable subaccount or account as computed in accordance with this section.  If the maximum assessment and the other assets of the association do not provide in a year an amount sufficient to carry out the association's responsibilities, the association shall make necessary additional assessments as soon as this chapter permits.

    Sec. 463.201.  PERSONS COVERED.  (a)  Subject to Subsections (b) and (c), this chapter provides coverage for a policy or contract described by Section [463.202](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=463.202) to a person who is:
    
    (1)  a person, other than a certificate holder under a group policy or contract who is not a resident, who is a beneficiary, assignee, or payee, including a health care provider who renders services covered under a health insurance policy or certificate, of a person described by Subdivision (2);
    
    (2)  a person who is an owner of or certificate holder or enrollee under a policy or contract specified by Section [463.202](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=463.202), other than an unallocated annuity contract or structured settlement annuity, and who is:
    
    (A)  a resident; or
    
    (B)  not a resident, but only under all of the following conditions:
    
    (i)  the member insurers that issued the policies or contracts are domiciled in this state;
    
    (ii)  the state in which the person resides has an association similar to the association; and
    
    (iii)  the person is not eligible for coverage by an association in any other state because the insurer or health maintenance organization was not licensed in the state at the time specified in that state's guaranty association law;
    
    (3)  a person who is the owner of an unallocated annuity contract issued to or in connection with:
    
    (A)  a benefit plan whose plan sponsor has the sponsor's principal place of business in this state; or
    
    (B)  a government lottery, if the owner is a resident; or
    
    (4)  a person who is the payee under a structured settlement annuity, or beneficiary of the payee if the payee is deceased, if:
    
    (A)  the payee is a resident, regardless of where the contract owner resides;
    
    (B)  the payee is not a resident, the contract owner of the structured settlement annuity is a resident, and the payee is not eligible for coverage by the association in the state in which the payee resides; or
    
    (C)  the payee and the contract owner are not residents, the insurer that issued the structured settlement annuity is domiciled in this state, the state in which the contract owner resides has an association similar to the association, and neither the payee or, if applicable, the payee's beneficiary, nor the contract owner is eligible for coverage by the association in the state in which the payee or contract owner resides.
    
    (b)  This chapter does not provide coverage to:
    
    (1)  a person who is a payee or the beneficiary of a payee with respect to a contract the owner of which is a resident of this state, if the payee or the payee's beneficiary is afforded any coverage by the association of another state;
    
    (2)  a person otherwise described by Subsection (a)(3), if any coverage is provided by the association of another state to that person; or
    
    (3)  a person who acquires rights to receive payments through a structured settlement factoring transaction as defined by Section 5891(c)(3)(A), Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. Section 5891(c)(3)(A)), regardless of whether the transaction occurred before, on, or after the date that section became effective.
    
    (c)  This chapter is intended to provide coverage to persons who are residents of this state, and in those limited circumstances as described in this chapter, to nonresidents.  In order to avoid duplicate coverage, if a person who would otherwise receive coverage under this chapter is provided coverage under the laws of any other state, the person may not be provided coverage under this chapter.  In determining the application of the provisions of this subsection in situations in which a person could be covered by the association of more than one state, whether as an owner, payee, enrollee, beneficiary, or assignee, this chapter shall be construed in conjunction with other state laws to result in coverage by only one association.

    (2)  was entitled only to change a premium by class.
    
    (h)  Substitute coverage is available for a group policy or contract under Subsection (f) only if the formerly insured or enrolled individual was entitled under law or the terminated policy or contract to convert group coverage to individual coverage.

The association shall offer the reissued or alternative policy without requiring evidence of insurability, at actuarially justified rates.  The reissued or alternative policy may not provide for a waiting period or exclusion that would not have applied under the terminated policy.  The association may reinsure a reissued or alternative policy.

    (b)  The association's subrogation rights under Subsection (a) have the same priority against the assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer as that held by the person entitled to receive a benefit under this chapter.

    (d)  The rights of the association under Subsection (c) include, in the case of a structured settlement annuity, any rights of the owner, beneficiary, or payee of the annuity, to the extent of benefits received under this chapter, against any person originally or by succession responsible for the losses arising from the personal injury relating to the annuity or payment for the annuity, other than a person responsible solely by reason of serving as an assignee in respect of a qualified assignment under Section 130, Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C.

Two or more persons liable for the same distribution are jointly and severally liable.  If a person liable under this subsection is insolvent, all of the affiliates that controlled the insolvent person when the distribution was paid are jointly and severally liable for any resulting deficiency in the amount recovered from the insolvent person.
