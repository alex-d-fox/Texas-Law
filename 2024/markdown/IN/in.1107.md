    Sec. 1107.051.  MINIMUM NONFORFEITURE AMOUNT.  The minimum value under Subchapter C of a paid-up annuity, cash surrender, or death benefit shall be computed on the basis of the minimum nonforfeiture amount prescribed by this subchapter.

    Sec. 1107.052.  CONTRACT WITH FLEXIBLE CONSIDERATIONS.  (a)  This section applies only to an annuity contract that provides for the payment of flexible considerations.
    
    (b)  The minimum nonforfeiture amount on or before annuity payments begin is an amount equal to the accumulation of the prescribed percentages of the amount of net considerations paid to the date of computation, which are accumulated at an interest rate of three percent per year, plus any additional amount credited to the contract by the company, less the amount of:
    
    (1)  any withdrawal from or partial surrender of the contract made before the minimum nonforfeiture amount is computed, accumulated at an interest rate of three percent per year;  and
    
    (2)  any indebtedness to the company on the contract, including any accrued interest due on the indebtedness.
    
    (c)  For the purposes of this section, the amount of net consideration for a contract year may not be less than $0 and is computed by subtracting from the amount of gross considerations credited to the contract during that contract year:
    
    (1)  an annual contract charge of $30;  and
    
    (2)  a collection charge of $1.25 for each consideration credited to the contract during that year.
    
    (d)  Except as provided by Subsection (e), the percentage of the amount of net consideration to be used in computing a minimum nonforfeiture amount under Subsection (b) is:
    
    (1)  65 percent for the first contract year;  and
    
    (2)  87.5 percent for each subsequent contract year.
    
    (e)  For a renewal contract year, the percentage of the amount of net consideration to be used to compute a minimum nonforfeiture amount under Subsection (b) is 65 percent of the portion of the total amount of net consideration that exceeds by not more than two times the sum of those portions of the amount of net consideration in all preceding contract years for which the percentage was 65 percent.

    Sec. 1107.053.  CONTRACT WITH FIXED, SCHEDULED CONSIDERATIONS.  (a)  For an annuity contract that provides for the payment of fixed, scheduled considerations, the minimum nonforfeiture amount is computed in the same manner as the minimum nonforfeiture amount for an annuity contract with flexible considerations that are paid annually, except that:
    
    (1)  the amount of net consideration for a contract year is computed using an annual contract charge equal to the lesser of:
    
    (A)  $30;  or
    
    (B)  10 percent of the amount of the gross annual considerations paid on the contract;  and
    
    (2)  the percentage of the net consideration amount for the first contract year to be used to compute the minimum nonforfeiture amount is 65 percent of the amount of net consideration for the first contract year plus 22.5 percent of the amount by which the amount of net consideration for the first contract year exceeds the lesser of:
    
    (A)  the amount of net consideration for the second contract year;  or
    
    (B)  the amount of net consideration for the third contract year.
    
    (b)  The computation made under Subsection (a) must assume that the considerations are paid annually in advance.

    Sec. 1107.054.  CONTRACT WITH SINGLE CONSIDERATION.  For an annuity contract that provides for the payment of a single consideration, the minimum nonforfeiture amount is computed in the same manner as the minimum nonforfeiture amount for a contract with flexible considerations, except that:
    
    (1)  the net consideration amount to be used to compute the minimum nonforfeiture amount is the amount of the gross considerations paid under the contract less a contract charge of $75;  and
    
    (2)  the percentage of the net consideration amount to be used to compute the minimum nonforfeiture amount is 90 percent.

    Sec. 1107.055.  INTEREST RATE.  The interest rate used in determining minimum nonforfeiture amounts shall be an annual rate of interest determined as the lesser of three percent per annum and the following, which must be specified in the contract if the interest rate will be redetermined:
    
    (1)  the five-year Constant Maturity Treasury Rate reported by the Federal Reserve as of a date, or average over a period, rounded to the nearest 1/20th of one percent, specified in the contract no longer than 15 months prior to the contract issue date or redetermination date under Subdivision (4);
    
    (2)  reduced by 125 basis points;
    
    (3)  where the resulting interest rate is not less than 0.15 percent; and
    
    (4)  the interest rate shall apply for an initial period and may be redetermined for additional periods.  The redetermination date, basis, and period, if any, shall be stated in the contract.  As used in this section, basis is the date, or average over a specified period, which produces the five-year Constant Maturity Treasury Rate to be used at each redetermination date.
