(a)  The total charges of a domestic title insurer for title insurance policies written or assumed on or after January 1, 1997, and before January 1, 1998, are computed by adding the following, as described in the insurer's annual statement:

    (1)  6-1/5 percent if the insurer had $250 million or more in direct premium written for the year 1996;  or
