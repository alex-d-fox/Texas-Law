    SUBCHAPTER A. GENERAL PROVISIONS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 1109.001.  APPLICABILITY OF CHAPTER.  (a)  This chapter applies to proceeds held and owing by a life insurance company engaged in the business of insurance in this state if:
    
    (1)  the last known address, according to the company's records, of the person entitled to the proceeds is located in this state;  and
    
    (2)  the proceeds have been unclaimed and unpaid for at least three years after the date, according to the company's records, that the proceeds became due and payable under a life or endowment insurance policy or annuity contract that has matured or terminated.
    
    (b)  If a person other than the insured or annuitant is entitled to the proceeds and that person's address is not known to the company or if the identity of the person entitled to the proceeds is not certain from the company's records, it is presumed that the last known address of the person entitled to the proceeds is the same as the last known address of the insured or annuitant according to the company's records.
    
    (c)  For purposes of Subsection (a), a life insurance policy not matured by proof of the death of the insured is considered to be matured and the proceeds of the policy are considered to be due and payable only if the policy is in force at the time the insured attained the limiting age under the mortality table on which the reserve is based.
    
    (d)  An annuity or other obligation, the payment of which is conditioned on the continued life of any individual, is not considered due and payable for purposes of Subsection (a) without proof that the individual was alive at the time or times required by the contract.
    
    (e)  Proceeds otherwise admittedly due and payable under a life or endowment insurance policy or annuity contract that has matured or terminated are considered to be held and owing even if the policy or contract has not been surrendered as required.

(a)  An insurer shall compare its in-force life insurance policies, annuity contracts, and retained asset accounts against a Death Master File at least semiannually to identify potential Death Master File matches.

    (1)  complete a documented good faith effort to confirm the death of the insured or retained asset account holder against other available records and information;
    
    (2)  review the insurer's records to determine whether the deceased individual had purchased or was otherwise covered by any of the insurer's other products; and
    
    (3)  determine whether proceeds may be due in accordance with the applicable policy or contract or terms governing the applicable account.
    
    (b)  For group life insurance or a group annuity contract, an insurer is required to confirm the possible death of an insured or retained asset account holder under this section only if the insurer provides recordkeeping services for the group policy or group annuity contract.
    
    (c)  If the insurer determines under Subsection (a)(3) that proceeds may be due and a beneficiary or other authorized representative has not communicated with the insurer on or before the 90th day after the date the insurer identifies a Death Master File match, the insurer shall:
    
    (1)  complete a documented good faith effort to locate and contact each beneficiary or other authorized representative on the relevant policy, contract, or account; and
    
    (2)  provide to the beneficiary or authorized representative the appropriate claim forms, instructions, or information to make a claim, including information about any need to provide an official death certificate or show proof of death under the applicable policy or contract or terms governing the applicable account.
    
    (d)  If an insurer is unable to confirm the death of an insured or retained asset account holder after the insurer identifies a Death Master File match, the insurer may consider the relevant policy, contract, or account to remain in force according to its terms.
    
    (e)  To the extent permitted by law, the insurer may disclose minimum necessary personal information about the insured, retained asset account holder, or beneficiary to a person the insurer reasonably believes may be able to assist the insurer in locating a person entitled to payment of the claim proceeds.
    
    (f)  An insurer or the insurer's service provider may not charge an insured, retained asset account holder, beneficiary, or authorized representative any fees or costs associated with conducting a Death Master File comparison under this subchapter or verifying a Death Master File match under this subchapter.
