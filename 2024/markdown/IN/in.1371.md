    Sec. 1371.003.  REQUIRED COVERAGE FOR PROSTHETIC DEVICES, ORTHOTIC DEVICES, AND RELATED SERVICES.  (a)  A health benefit plan must provide coverage for prosthetic devices, orthotic devices, and professional services related to the fitting and use of those devices that equals the coverage provided under federal laws for health insurance for the aged and disabled under Sections 1832, 1833, and 1834, Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. Sections 1395k, 1395l, and 1395m), and 42 C.F.R. Sections 410.100, 414.202, 414.210, and 414.228, as applicable.
    
    (b)  Covered benefits under this chapter are limited to the most appropriate model of prosthetic device or orthotic device that adequately meets the medical needs of the enrollee as determined by the  enrollee's treating physician or podiatrist and prosthetist or orthotist, as applicable.
    
    (c)  Subject to applicable copayments and deductibles, the repair and replacement of a prosthetic device or orthotic device is a covered benefit under this chapter unless the repair or replacement is necessitated by misuse or loss by the enrollee.
    
    (d)  Coverage required under this section:
    
    (1)  must be provided in a manner determined to be appropriate in consultation with the treating physician or podiatrist and prosthetist or orthotist, as applicable, and the enrollee;

    Sec. 1371.005.  MANAGED CARE PLAN.  A health benefit plan provider may require that, if coverage is provided through a managed care plan, the benefits mandated under this chapter are covered benefits only if the prosthetic devices or orthotic devices are provided by a vendor or a provider, and related services are rendered by a provider, that contracts with or is designated by the health benefit plan provider.  If the health benefit plan provider provides in-network and out-of-network services, the coverage for prosthetic devices or orthotic devices provided through out-of-network services must be comparable to that provided through in-network services.
