    (e)  The commissioner shall adopt rules that govern the manner in which an employer may terminate, because of a financial hardship affecting the employer, participation in a health group cooperative.
    
    (f)  An employer's participation in a health group cooperative is voluntary, but an employer electing to participate in a health group cooperative must commit to purchasing coverage through the health group cooperative for two years, except as provided by Subsection (e).

    (2)  regulates the differences in rates applicable to services provided within a health benefit plan network or outside the network.
    
    (j)  The commissioner by rule shall implement the exemption authorized by Subsection (i).

At the expiration of 60 days after the date of receipt by the department of a filed application, the application is considered approved by the department unless, before that date, the application was either affirmatively approved or disapproved by written order of the commissioner.  The commissioner, after notice and opportunity for hearing, may rescind an approval granted to a health benefit plan issuer under this subsection if the commissioner finds that the health benefit plan issuer has failed to market fairly to all eligible employers in the state or the expanded service area.

Evidence of the election must be filed in writing with the commissioner in the form and at the time prescribed by the commissioner by rule.
    
    (q)  Except as provided by Subsection (r), a health group cooperative may file an election with the commissioner, on a form and in the manner prescribed by the commissioner, to permit eligible single-employee businesses to join the cooperative and to enroll in health benefit plan coverage.  The election must be filed not later than the 90th day before the date coverage for eligible single-employee businesses is to become effective.
    
    (r)  A health group cooperative may file an election under Subsection (q) only if a small or large employer health benefit plan issuer has agreed in writing to offer to issue coverage to the cooperative based on its membership after the election to permit eligible single-employee businesses to participate in the cooperative has become effective.
    
    (s)  On the date an election under Subsection (q) becomes effective and until the election is rescinded, the provisions of this subchapter relating to guaranteed issuance of plans, to rating requirements, and to mandated benefits that are applicable to small employers apply to eligible single-employee businesses that are members of the health group cooperative.
    
    (t)  A health group cooperative that files an election with the commissioner to permit an eligible single-employee business to join the health group cooperative and enroll in health benefit plan coverage must permit participation and enrollment in the cooperative's health benefit plan coverage during the initial enrollment and annual open enrollment periods by each eligible single-employee business that elects to participate and agrees to satisfy requirements associated with participation in and coverage through the cooperative.  For purposes of this subsection, the provisions of Subsection (a-1) applicable to small employers apply to eligible single-employee businesses.
    
    (u)  A health group cooperative may rescind its election to permit eligible single-employee businesses to join the cooperative and enroll in health benefit plan coverage only if:
    
    (1)  the election has been effective for at least two years, except as provided by Subsection (v);
    
    (2)  the health group cooperative files notice of the rescission with the commissioner not later than the 180th day before the effective date of the rescission; and
    
    (3)  the health group cooperative provides written notice of termination of coverage to all eligible single-employee business members of the cooperative not later than the 180th day before the effective date of the termination.
    
    (v)  The commissioner shall adopt rules under which a health group cooperative may for good cause rescind an election described by Subsection (u) before the second anniversary of the effective date of the election.
    
    (w)  Notwithstanding Subsection (u), a health group cooperative that files notice of rescission may choose to permit existing eligible single-employee businesses to remain active, covered members of the cooperative, but only if all such members of the cooperative are provided the same opportunity.
    
    (x)  A health group cooperative that has rescinded an election under Subsection (u) may not file a subsequent election to permit eligible single-employee businesses to join the cooperative and enroll in health benefit plan coverage before the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the rescission.

    Sec. 1501.153.  EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION.  (a)  This chapter does not require a small employer to make an employer contribution to the premium paid to a small employer health benefit plan issuer, but the issuer may require an employer contribution in accordance with the issuer's usual and customary practices applicable to the issuer's employer group health benefit plans in this state.  The issuer shall apply the employer contribution level uniformly to each small employer offered or issued coverage by the issuer in this state.
    
    (a-1)  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), a small employer health benefit plan issuer may offer a small employer the option of a small employer health benefit plan for which the employer is required to contribute 100 percent of the premium paid.  A plan offered under this subsection may be offered in addition to a plan offered by the issuer in accordance with Subsection (a) that requires a lower percentage of the premium paid to be contributed by the employer.  A plan issued under this subsection must require the employer to contribute 100 percent of the premium paid for each eligible participating employee.
    
    (b)  If two or more small employer health benefit plan issuers participate in a purchasing cooperative established under Section [1501.056](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1501.056), each participating issuer may use the employer contribution requirement established by the cooperative for policies marketed by the cooperative.
    
    (c)  A small employer that elects to make an employer contribution to the premium paid to a small employer health benefit plan issuer is not required to pay any amount with respect to an employee who elects not to be covered.
    
    (d)  A small employer may elect to pay the premium for additional coverage.

Rating factors must produce premium rates for identical groups that:
    
    (1)  differ only by the amounts attributable to health benefit plan design;  and
