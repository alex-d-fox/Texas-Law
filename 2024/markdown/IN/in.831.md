    CHAPTER 831. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ANNUAL DISCLOSURE
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 831.0001.  APPLICABILITY AND PURPOSE.  (a)  The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public interest by:
    
    (1)  requiring annual disclosure of an insurer or insurance group's corporate governance structure, policies, and practices to permit the commissioner to gain and maintain an understanding of the insurer's corporate governance framework; and
    
    (2)  providing for the confidential treatment of the corporate governance annual disclosure and related information as the disclosure and related information will contain confidential and sensitive information related to an insurer or insurance group's internal operations and proprietary and trade-secret information which, if made public, could potentially cause the insurer or insurance group competitive harm or disadvantage.
    
    (b)  This chapter may not be construed to prescribe or impose corporate governance standards and internal procedures beyond that which is required under applicable state corporate law.
    
    (c)  Notwithstanding Subsection (b), this chapter may not be construed to limit the commissioner's authority, or the rights or obligations of third parties, under Chapter [401](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=401).
    
    (d)  This chapter applies to each insurer domiciled in this state, except that this chapter does not apply to a domestic insurer that is authorized, admitted, or eligible to engage in the business of insurance only in this state. For the purposes of this chapter, an insurer is not considered to be authorized, admitted, or eligible to engage in the business of insurance only in this state if the insurer is a member of an insurance group that writes or assumes insurance in any manner in another state.
