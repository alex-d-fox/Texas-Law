    (b)  A rate used under this code:
    
    (1)  must be just, fair, reasonable, and adequate; and
    
    (2)  may not be:

    (B)  excessive for the risks to which the rate applies; or
    
    (C)  unfairly discriminatory.
    
    (c)  For purposes of this section, a rate is:
    
    (1)  inadequate if the rate is insufficient to sustain projected losses and expenses to which the rate applies, and continued use of the rate:
    
    (A)  endangers the solvency of an insurer using the rate; or
    
    (B)  has the effect of substantially lessening competition or creating a monopoly in any market;

    (3)  unfairly discriminatory if the rate:
    
    (A)  is not based on sound actuarial principles;
    
    (B)  does not bear a reasonable relationship to the expected loss and expense experience among risks; or
    
    (C)  is based wholly or partly on the race, creed, color, ethnicity, or national origin of the policyholder or an insured.
