The legislature finds that it is appropriate to provide additional remedies to these persons.
    
    (b)  The commissioner's powers under this Act shall be liberally construed to support the purpose stated in Subsection (a).
    
    (c)  This chapter does not limit the powers granted the commissioner under other provisions of law.  The powers and authority of the commissioner under this chapter are cumulative and are in addition to all other powers and authority that are available to the commissioner.
