In addition to any other requirements, the annual statement must specify the total number, aggregate face amount, and life settlement proceeds of policies settled during the immediately preceding calendar year, together with a breakdown of the information by policy issue year.  The annual statement must also include the names of each insurance company whose policies have been settled and the brokers that have settled the policies.
    
    (b)  The information required under Subsection (a) is limited to only those transactions in which the insured is a resident of this state and may not include individual transaction data regarding the business of life settlements or information if there is a reasonable basis to find that the information could be used to identify the owner or the insured.
    
    (c)  A provider that wilfully fails to file an annual statement as required in this section, or wilfully fails to reply not later than the 30th day after the date the provider receives a written inquiry from the department about the filing of the annual statement, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by this chapter, after notice and opportunity for hearing be subject to a penalty of up to $250 for each day of delay, not to exceed $25,000 in the aggregate, for the failure to file or respond.
    
    (d)  Except as otherwise allowed or required by law, a provider, broker, insurance company, insurance agent, information bureau, rating agency or company, or any other person with actual knowledge of an insured's identity, may not disclose the identity of an insured or information that there is a reasonable basis to believe could be used to identify the insured or the insured's financial or medical information to any other person unless the disclosure is:
    
    (1)  necessary to effect a life settlement contract between the owner and a provider and the owner and insured have provided prior written consent to the disclosure;
    
    (2)  necessary to effectuate the sale of a life settlement contract, or interests in the contract, as an investment, provided the sale is conducted in accordance with applicable state and federal securities law and provided further that the owner and the insured have both provided prior written consent to the disclosure;

    (4)  a term or condition of the transfer of a policy by one provider to another licensed provider, in which case the receiving provider shall comply with the confidentiality requirements of this subsection;
    
    (5)  necessary to allow the provider or broker or the provider's or broker's authorized representative to make contact for the purpose of determining health status provided that in this subdivision, authorized representative does not include a person who has or may have a financial interest in the settlement contract other than a provider, licensed broker, financing entity, related provider trust, or special purpose entity and that the provider or broker requires the authorized representative to agree in writing to adhere to the privacy provisions of this chapter; or
    
    (6)  required to purchase stop loss coverage.
    
    (e)  Nonpublic personal information solicited or obtained in connection with a proposed or actual life settlement contract is subject to the provisions applicable to financial institutions under the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (Pub. L. No. 106-102), and any other state and federal laws relating to confidentiality of nonpublic personal information.

    (4)  the fact that receipt of proceeds from a life settlement contract may adversely affect the recipients' eligibility for public assistance or other government benefits or entitlements and that advice should be obtained from the appropriate agency;
    
    (5)  the fact that the owner has a right to terminate a life settlement contract within 15 days of the date the contract is executed by all parties and the owner has received the disclosures described in this section, that rescission, if exercised by the owner, is effective only if both notice of the rescission is given and the owner repays all proceeds and any premiums, loans, and loan interest paid on account of the provider during the rescission period, and that if the insured dies during the rescission period, the contract is considered rescinded subject to repayment by the owner or the owner's estate of all proceeds and any premiums, loans, and loan interest to the provider;
    
    (6)  the fact that proceeds will be sent to the owner within three business days after the provider has received the insurer or group administrator's acknowledgement that ownership of the policy or interest in the certificate has been transferred and the beneficiary has been designated in accordance with the terms of the life settlement contract;
    
    (7)  the fact that entering into a life settlement contract may cause the owner to forfeit other rights or benefits, including conversion rights and waiver of premium benefits that may exist under the policy or certificate of a group policy, and that assistance should be sought from a professional financial advisor;
    
    (8)  the amount and method of calculating the compensation, including anything of value, paid or given, or to be paid or given, to the broker, or any other person acting for the owner in connection with the transaction;
    
    (9)  the date by which the funds will be available to the owner and the identity of the transmitter of the funds;

    (11)  the following language:  "All medical, financial, or personal information solicited or obtained by a provider or broker about an insured, including the insured's identity or the identity of family members or a spouse or a significant other, may be disclosed as necessary to effect the life settlement contract between the owner and provider.  If you are asked to provide this information, you will be asked to consent to the disclosure.  The information may be provided to someone who buys the policy or provides funds for the purchase.  You may be asked to renew your permission to share information every two years.";
    
    (12)  the fact that the commissioner requires providers and brokers to print separate signed fraud warnings on the applications and on the life settlement contracts as follows:  "Any person who knowingly presents false information in an application for insurance or a life settlement contract is guilty of a crime and may be subject to fines and confinement in prison.";
    
    (13)  the fact that the insured may be contacted by either the provider or broker or an authorized representative of the provider or broker for the purpose of determining the insured's health status or to verify the insured's address and that this contact is limited to once every three months if the insured has a life expectancy of more than one year, and not more than once per month if the insured has a life expectancy of one year or less;
    
    (14)  the affiliation, if any, between the provider and the issuer of the insurance policy to be settled;
    
    (15)  that a broker represents exclusively the owner, and not the insurer or the provider or any other person, and owes a fiduciary duty to the owner, including a duty to act according to the owner's instructions and in the best interest of the owner;
    
    (16)  the name, address, and telephone number of the provider;
    
    (17)  the name, business address, and telephone number of the independent third party escrow agent, and the fact that the owner may inspect or receive copies of the relevant escrow or trust agreements or documents; and

    (b)  The written disclosures described by Subsection (a) must be conspicuously displayed in a life settlement contract furnished to the owner by a provider, including any affiliations or contractual arrangements between the provider and the broker.
    
    (c)  A broker shall provide the owner and the provider with at least the following disclosures not later than the date on which the life settlement contract is signed by all parties and which must be conspicuously displayed in the life settlement contract or in a separate document signed by the owner:

    (2)  a full, complete, and accurate description of all the offers, counter-offers, acceptances, and rejections relating to the proposed life settlement contract;

    Sec. 1111A.013.  DISCLOSURE TO INSURER.  (a)  Without limiting the ability of an insurer to assess the insurability of a policy applicant and to determine whether to issue the policy, and in addition to other questions an insurance carrier may lawfully pose to a life insurance applicant, an insurer may inquire in the application for insurance whether the proposed owner intends to pay premiums with the assistance of financing from a lender that will use the policy as collateral to support the financing.
    
    (b)  If, as described in Sections [1111A.002](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1111A.002)(11) and (11-A), the loan provides funds that can be used for a purpose other than paying for the premiums, costs, and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining the life insurance policy and loan, and notwithstanding any other law, the application must be rejected as a violation of Section [1111A.017](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1111A.017).
    
    (c)  If the financing does not violate Section [1111A.017](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1111A.017), the insurance carrier:
    
    (1)  may make disclosures, not later than the date of the delivery of the policy, to the applicant and the insured, either on the application or on an amendment to the application that include the following or substantially similar statements:
    
    "If you have entered into a loan arrangement in which the policy is used as collateral, and the policy does change ownership at some point in the future in satisfaction of the loan, the following may be true:
    
    (A)  a change of ownership could lead to a stranger owning an interest in the insured's life;
    
    (B)  a change of ownership could in the future limit your ability to purchase future insurance on the insured's life because there is a limit to how much coverage insurers will issue on one life;
    
    (C)  should there be a change of ownership and you wish to obtain more insurance coverage on the insured's life in the future, the insured's higher issue age, a change in health status, or other factors may reduce the ability to obtain coverage or may result in significantly higher premiums; and
    
    (D)  you should consult a professional advisor, since a change in ownership in satisfaction of the loan may result in tax consequences to the owner, depending on the structure of the loan.";
    
    (2)  may require certifications, such as the following, from the applicant or the insured:
    
    (A)  "I have not entered into any agreement or arrangement providing for the future sale of this life insurance policy";
    
    (B)  "My loan arrangement for this policy provides funds sufficient to pay for some or all of the premiums, costs, and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining my life insurance policy, but I have not entered into any agreement by which I am to receive consideration in exchange for procuring this policy"; and
    
    (C)  "The borrower has an insurable interest in the insured."

    Sec. 1111A.014.  GENERAL RULES.  (a)  Before entering into a life settlement contract with an owner of a policy with respect to which the insured is terminally or chronically ill, the provider must obtain:
    
    (1)  if the owner is the insured, a written statement from a licensed attending physician that the owner is of sound mind and under no constraint or undue influence to enter into a settlement contract; and
    
    (2)  a document in which the insured consents to the release of medical records to a provider, settlement broker, or insurance agent and, if the policy was issued less than two years after the date of application for a settlement contract, to the insurance company that issued the policy.
    
    (b)  An insurer shall respond to a request for verification of coverage submitted by a provider, settlement broker, or life insurance agent not later than the 30th calendar day after the date the request is received.  The request for verification of coverage must be made on a form approved by the commissioner.  The insurer shall complete and issue the verification of coverage or indicate in which respects the insurer is unable to respond.  In the response, the insurer shall indicate whether at the time of the response, based on the medical evidence and documents provided, the insurer intends to pursue an investigation about the validity of the insurance contract.
    
    (c)  On or before the date of execution of the life settlement contract, the provider shall obtain a witnessed document in which the owner consents to the settlement contract, represents that the owner has a full and complete understanding of the settlement contract and of the benefits of the policy, acknowledges that the owner is entering into the settlement contract freely and voluntarily, and, for persons with a terminal or chronic illness or condition, acknowledges that the insured has a terminal or chronic illness and that the terminal or chronic illness or condition was diagnosed after the policy was issued.
    
    (d)  The insurer may not unreasonably delay effecting change of ownership or beneficiary with any life settlement contract lawfully entered into in this state or with a resident of this state.
    
    (e)  If a settlement broker or life insurance agent performs any of these activities required of the provider, the provider is deemed to have fulfilled the requirements of this section.
    
    (f)  If a broker performs the verification of coverage activities required of the provider, the provider is deemed to have fulfilled the requirements of Section [1111A.012](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1111A.012).
    
    (g)  Not later than the 20th day after the date that an owner executes the life settlement contract, the provider shall give written notice to the insurer that issued that insurance policy that the policy has become subject to a life settlement contract.  The notice shall be accompanied by the documents required by Section [1111A.013](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1111A.013)(c).
    
    (h)  Medical information solicited or obtained by a license holder is subject to the applicable provision of state law relating to confidentiality of medical information, if not otherwise provided in this chapter.
    
    (i)  A life settlement contract entered into in this state must provide that the owner may rescind the contract on or before 15 days after the date the contract is executed by all parties to the contract.  Rescission, if exercised by the owner, is effective only if notice of the rescission is given and the owner repays all proceeds and any premiums, loans, and loan interest paid on account of the provider within the rescission period.  If the insured dies during the rescission period, the contract is rescinded subject to repayment by the owner or the owner's estate of all proceeds and any premiums, loans, and loan interest to the provider.
    
    (j)  Not later than the third business day after the date the provider receives from the owner the documents to effect the transfer of the insurance policy, the provider shall pay the proceeds of the settlement into an escrow or trust account managed by a trustee or escrow agent in a state or federally chartered financial institution pending acknowledgement of the transfer by the issuer of the policy.  The trustee or escrow agent shall transfer to the owner the proceeds due to the owner not later than the third business day after the date the trustee or escrow officer receives from the insurer acknowledgment of the transfer of the insurance policy.
    
    (k)  Failure to tender the life settlement contract proceeds to the owner on or before the date disclosed to the owner renders the contract voidable by the owner for lack of consideration until the time the proceeds are tendered to and accepted by the owner.  A failure to give written notice of the right of rescission under this subsection tolls the right of rescission for 30 days after the date the written notice of the right of rescission has been given.
    
    (l)  A fee paid by a provider, an owner, or other person to a broker in exchange for services provided to the owner pertaining to a life settlement contract must be computed as a percentage of the offer obtained, not the face value of the policy.  Nothing in this section prohibits a broker from voluntarily reducing the broker's fee to less than a percentage of the offer obtained.
    
    (m)  A broker shall disclose to the owner anything of value paid or given to a broker that relates to a life settlement contract.
    
    (n)  A person, at any time prior to or at the time of the application for, or issuance of, a policy, or during a two-year period beginning on the date of issuance of the policy, may not enter into a life settlement contract regardless of the date the compensation is to be provided and regardless of the date the assignment, transfer, sale, devise, bequest, or surrender of the policy is to occur.  This prohibition does not apply if:
    
    (1)  the owner certifies to the provider that the policy was issued on the owner's exercise of conversion rights arising out of a group or individual policy, provided the total of the time covered under the conversion policy plus the time covered under the prior policy is at least 24 months; or
    
    (2)  the owner submits independent evidence to the provider that one or more of the following conditions have been met during the two-year period described by this subsection:
    
    (A)  the owner or insured is terminally or chronically ill;
    
    (B)  the owner or insured disposes of the owner's or insured's ownership interests in a closely held corporation, pursuant to the terms of a buyout or other similar agreement in effect at the time the insurance policy was initially issued;
    
    (C)  the owner's spouse dies;
    
    (D)  the owner divorces the owner's spouse;
    
    (E)  the owner retires from full-time employment;
    
    (F)  the owner becomes physically or mentally disabled and a physician determines that the disability prevents the owner from maintaining full-time employment; or
    
    (G)  a final order, judgment, or decree is entered by a court of competent jurisdiction, on the application of a creditor of the owner, adjudicating the owner bankrupt or insolvent, or approving a petition seeking reorganization of the owner or appointing a receiver, trustee, or liquidator to all or a substantial part of the owner's assets.
    
    (o)  For the purposes of Subsection (n)(1), time covered under a group policy must be calculated without regard to a change in insurance carriers, provided the coverage has been continuous and under the same group sponsorship.
    
    (p)  Copies of the independent evidence described by Subsection (n)(2) must be submitted to the insurer at the time the provider submits a request to the insurer for verification of coverage.  The copies must be accompanied by a letter of attestation from the provider that the copies are true and correct copies of the documents received by the provider.  This section does not prohibit an insurer from exercising its right to contest the validity of a policy.
    
    (q)  If the provider submits to the insurer a copy of independent evidence provided for Subsection (n)(2)(A) at the time the provider submits a request to the insurer to effect the transfer of the policy to the provider, the copy is deemed to establish that the settlement contract satisfies the requirements of this section.

    Sec. 1111A.016.  CONFLICT OF LAWS.  (a)  If there is more than one owner on a single policy, and the owners are residents of different states, the life settlement contract is governed by the law of the state in which the owner having the largest percentage ownership resides or, if the owners hold equal ownership, the state of residence of one owner agreed on in writing by all of the owners.  The law of the state of the insured shall govern in the event that equal owners fail to agree in writing on a state of residence for jurisdictional purposes.
    
    (b)  A provider licensed in this state who enters into a life settlement contract with an owner who is a resident of another state that has enacted statutes or adopted rules governing life settlement contracts is governed in the effectuation of that life settlement contract by the statutes and rules of the owner's state of residence.  If the state in which the owner is a resident has not enacted statutes or adopted rules governing life settlement contracts, the provider shall give the owner notice that neither state regulates the transaction on which the owner is entering.  For transactions in those states, however, the provider shall maintain all records required by this chapter if the transactions were executed in this state.  The forms used in those states need not be approved by the department.
