    (2)  elects to be covered under the replacement plan.
    
    (b)  An individual who would be covered by the succeeding carrier under Subsection (a) but who does not satisfy the replacement plan's actively at work and nonconfinement requirements shall be covered under the replacement plan when the individual satisfies those requirements.
