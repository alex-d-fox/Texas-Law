    (1)  subjects the health maintenance organization to excessive charges;
    
    (2)  extends for an unreasonable time;
    
    (3)  does not contain fair and adequate standards of performance;

    (f)  The fidelity bond must obligate the surety to pay any loss of money or other property that the health maintenance organization sustains because of an act of fraud or dishonesty by an employee or officer of the management contractor during the period that the management contract is in effect.
    
    (g)  Instead of a fidelity bond, the management contractor may deposit with the comptroller cash or securities acceptable to the commissioner.  The deposit must be maintained in the amount and is subject to the same conditions required for a fidelity bond under this section.

    Sec. 843.108.  POINT-OF-SERVICE RIDER.  (a)  In this section, "point-of-service rider" means a rider under which indemnity benefits for the cost of health care services are provided by a health maintenance organization in conjunction with corresponding benefits arranged for or provided by a health maintenance organization.
    
    (b)  A health maintenance organization may offer a point-of-service rider for out-of-network coverage without obtaining a separate certificate of authority as an insurer if the expenses incurred under the point-of-service rider do not exceed 10 percent of the total medical and hospital expenses incurred for all health plan products sold by the health maintenance organization.  If the expenses exceed that level, the health maintenance organization may not issue new point-of-service riders until the expenses fall below that level or until the health maintenance organization obtains a certificate of authority as an insurer.
    
    (c)  Indemnity benefits for services provided under a point-of-service rider may be limited to those services defined in the evidence of coverage and may be subject to different cost-sharing provisions.  The cost-sharing provisions for indemnity benefits may be higher than the cost-sharing provisions for in-network health maintenance organization coverage.  For enrollees in a limited provider network, higher cost-sharing may be imposed only when benefits or services are obtained outside the health maintenance organization delivery network.
    
    (d)  A health maintenance organization that issues a point-of-service rider under this section must meet additional net worth requirements prescribed by the commissioner.  The commissioner shall base the net worth requirements on the actuarial relation of the amount of insurance risk assumed through the point-of-service rider to the amount of solvency and reserve requirements otherwise required of the health maintenance organization.

    (A)  indemnity benefits for the cost of dental care services, other than emergency care or emergency dental care, are provided by an insurer or group hospital service corporation in conjunction with corresponding benefits arranged or provided by a health maintenance organization;  and

    (2)  "Provider panel" means the providers with whom a health maintenance organization contracts to provide dental services to enrollees covered under a dental benefit plan.
    
    (b)  This section applies to a dental health maintenance organization or another single service health maintenance organization that provides dental benefits.  This section does not apply to a health maintenance organization that has 10,000 or fewer enrollees in this state who are enrolled in dental benefit plans based on a provider panel.
    
    (c)  If an employer, association, or other private group arrangement that employs 25 or more employees or has 25 or more members offers and contributes to the cost of dental benefit plan coverage to employees or individuals only through a provider panel, the health maintenance organization with which the employer, association, or other private group arrangement is contracting for the coverage shall offer, or contract with another entity to offer, a dental point-of-service option to the employer, association, or other private group arrangement.  The employer may offer the dental point-of-service option to the employee or individual to accept or reject.
    
    (d)  If a health maintenance organization's dental provider panel is the sole delivery system offered to employees by an employer, the health maintenance organization:

    (2)  may not impose a minimum participation level on the dental point-of-service option;  and

The premium for the point-of-service option must be based on the actuarial value of that coverage.
    
    (f)  Different cost-sharing provisions may be imposed for the point-of-service option.
    
    (g)  An employer may charge an employee or individual who accepts the point-of-service option a reasonable administrative fee for costs associated with the employer's reasonable administration of the point-of-service option.

    SUBCHAPTER J. PAYMENT OF CLAIMS TO PHYSICIANS AND PROVIDERS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 843.336.  DEFINITION.  (a)  In this subchapter, "clean claim" means a claim that complies with this section.
    
    (b)  A nonelectronic claim by a physician or provider, other than an institutional provider, is a clean claim if the claim is submitted using the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Form 1500 or, if adopted by the commissioner by rule, a successor to that form developed by the National Uniform Claim Committee or its successor.  An electronic claim by a physician or provider, other than an institutional provider, is a clean claim if the claim is submitted using the Professional 837 (ASC X12N 837) format or, if adopted by the commissioner by rule, a successor to that format adopted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or its successor.
    
    (c)  A nonelectronic claim by an institutional provider is a clean claim if the claim is submitted using the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Form UB-92 or, if adopted by the commissioner by rule, a successor to that form developed by the National Uniform Billing Committee or its successor.  An electronic claim by an institutional provider is a clean claim if the claim is submitted using the Institutional 837 (ASC X12N 837) format or, if adopted by the commissioner by rule, a successor to that format adopted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or its successor.
    
    (d)  The commissioner may adopt rules that specify the information that must be entered into the appropriate fields on the applicable claim form for a claim to be a clean claim.
    
    (e)  The commissioner may not require any data element for an electronic claim that is not required in an electronic transaction set needed to comply with federal law.
    
    (f)  A health maintenance organization and a physician or provider may agree by contract to use fewer data elements than are required in an electronic transaction set needed to comply with federal law.
    
    (g)  An otherwise clean claim submitted by a physician or provider that includes additional fields, data elements, attachments, or other information not required under this section is considered to be a clean claim for the purposes of this section.

    Sec. 843.337.  TIME FOR SUBMISSION OF CLAIM;  DUPLICATE CLAIMS;  ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF RECEIPT OF CLAIM.  (a)  A physician or provider must submit a claim to a health maintenance organization not later than the 95th day after the date the physician or provider provides the health care services for which the claim is made.  A health maintenance organization shall accept as proof of timely filing a claim filed in compliance with Subsection (e) or information from another health maintenance organization or insurer showing that the physician or provider submitted the claim to the health maintenance organization or insurer in compliance with Subsection (e).
    
    (b)  If a physician or provider fails to submit a claim in compliance with this section, the physician or provider forfeits the right to payment.
    
    (c)  The period for submitting a claim under this section may be extended by:
    
    (1)  contract;
    
    (2)  notice published by the commissioner allowing an extension of prompt payment deadlines to a later date chosen by the commissioner due to a catastrophic event; or
    
    (3)  the department's approval of a physician's or provider's request for an extension due to a catastrophic event that substantially interferes with the normal business operations of the physician or provider.
    
    (c-1)  The commissioner may adopt rules to implement Subsection (c), including rules establishing requirements for a request made under Subsection (c)(3).
    
    (d)  A physician or provider may not submit a duplicate claim for payment before the 46th day after the date the original claim was submitted.  The commissioner shall adopt rules under which a health maintenance organization may determine whether a claim is a duplicate claim.
    
    (e)  Except as provided by Chapter [1213](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1213), a physician or provider may, as appropriate:
    
    (1)  mail a claim by United States mail, first class, or by overnight delivery service;
    
    (2)  submit the claim electronically;
    
    (3)  fax the claim; or
    
    (4)  hand deliver the claim.
    
    (f)  If a claim for health care services provided to a patient is mailed, the claim is presumed to have been received by the health maintenance organization on the fifth day after the date the claim is mailed or, if the claim is mailed using overnight service or return receipt requested, on the date the delivery receipt is signed.  If the claim is submitted electronically, the claim is presumed to have been received on the date of the electronic verification of receipt by the health maintenance organization or the health maintenance organization's clearinghouse.  If the health maintenance organization or the health maintenance organization's clearinghouse does not provide a confirmation within 24 hours of submission by the physician or provider, the physician's or provider's clearinghouse shall provide the confirmation.  The physician's or provider's clearinghouse must be able to verify that the filing contained the correct payor identification of the entity to receive the filing.  If the claim is faxed, the claim is presumed to have been received on the date of the transmission acknowledgment.  If the claim is hand delivered, the claim is presumed to have been received on the date the delivery receipt is signed.

    (2)  $100,000.

    (d)  Except as provided by this section, a health maintenance organization that determines under this subchapter that a claim is payable, pays only a portion of the amount of the claim on or before the date the health maintenance organization is required to make a determination or adjudication of the claim, and pays the balance of the contracted rate owed for the claim after that date shall pay to the physician or provider, in addition to the contracted amount owed, a penalty on the amount not timely paid in the amount of the lesser of:
    
    (1)  50 percent of the underpaid amount;  or
    
    (2)  $100,000.

    (h)  A health maintenance organization is not liable for a penalty under this section:
    
    (1)  if the failure to pay the claim in accordance with this subchapter is a result of a catastrophic event and:
    
    (A)  the commissioner published a notice allowing an extension of the applicable prompt payment deadlines due to the catastrophic event; or
    
    (B)  the department approved the health maintenance organization's request for an extension due to the substantial interference of the catastrophic event with the normal business operations of the health maintenance organization; or

    (A)  the physician or provider notifies the health maintenance organization of the underpayment after the 270th day after the date the underpayment was received; and
    
    (B)  the health maintenance organization pays the balance of the claim on or before the 30th day after the date the health maintenance organization receives the notice.

    (k)  In addition to any other penalty or remedy authorized by this code or another insurance law of this state, a health maintenance organization that violates Section [843.338](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=843.338), [843.339](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=843.339), or [843.340](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=843.340) in processing more than two percent of clean claims submitted to the health maintenance organization is subject to an administrative penalty under Chapter [84](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=84).  For each day an administrative penalty is imposed under this subsection, the penalty may not exceed $1,000 for each claim that remains unpaid in violation of Section [843.338](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=843.338), [843.339](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=843.339), or [843.340](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=843.340).

    (m)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, this subsection governs the payment of a penalty under this section.  For a penalty under this section relating to a clean claim submitted by a physician or provider other than an institutional provider, the health maintenance organization shall pay the entire penalty to the physician or provider, except for any interest computed under Subsection (c), which shall be paid to the Texas Health Insurance Risk Pool.

    (e)  A health maintenance organization may establish a specific period during which the verification is valid of not less than 30 days.
    
    (f)  A health maintenance organization that declines to provide a verification shall notify the physician or provider who requested the verification of the specific reason the verification was not provided.

    (g)  If the health maintenance organization has preauthorized health care services, the health maintenance organization may not deny or reduce payment to the physician or provider for those services based on medical necessity or appropriateness of care unless the physician or provider has materially misrepresented the proposed health care services or has substantially failed to perform the proposed health care services.
    
    (h)  This section applies to an agent or other person with whom a health maintenance organization contracts to perform, or to whom the health maintenance organization delegates the performance of, preauthorization of proposed health care services.

(a)  In this section, "special circumstance" means a condition regarding which a treating physician or provider reasonably believes that discontinuing care by that physician or provider could cause harm to an enrollee who is a patient.  Examples of an enrollee who has a special circumstance include an enrollee with a disability, acute condition, life-threatening illness, or who is past the 24th week of pregnancy.
    
    (b)  Each contract between a health maintenance organization and a physician and provider must provide that termination of the contract, except for reason of medical competence or professional behavior, does not release the health maintenance organization from the obligation of continuing to reimburse a physician or provider providing medically necessary treatment at the time of termination to an enrollee who has a special circumstance in accordance with the dictates of medical prudence.  Subject to Subsections (d) and (e), the health maintenance organization must provide continued reimbursement at not less than the contract rate in exchange for the enrollee's continued receipt of ongoing treatment from the physician or provider.
    
    (c)  The treating physician or provider shall identify a special circumstance.  The treating physician or provider must:
    
    (1)  request that an enrollee be permitted to continue treatment under the physician's or provider's care;  and
    
    (2)  agree not to seek payment from the enrollee of any amount for which the enrollee would not be responsible if the physician or provider continued to be included in the health maintenance organization delivery network.
    
    (d)  Except as provided by Subsection (e), this section does not extend the obligation of a health maintenance organization to reimburse a terminated physician or provider for ongoing treatment of an enrollee after:
    
    (1)  the 90th day after the effective date of the termination;  or
    
    (2)  if the enrollee has been diagnosed with a terminal illness at the time of termination, the expiration of the nine-month period after the effective date of the termination.
    
    (e)  If an enrollee is past the 24th week of pregnancy at the time of termination, a health maintenance organization's obligation to reimburse a terminated physician or provider or, if applicable, an enrollee extends through delivery of the child and applies to immediate postpartum care and a follow-up checkup within the six-week period after delivery.
    
    (f)  A contract between a health maintenance organization and a physician or provider must provide procedures for resolving disputes regarding the necessity for continued treatment by a physician or provider.

    (1)  information or opinions regarding the patient's health care, including the patient's medical condition or treatment options;
    
    (2)  information or opinions regarding the terms, requirements, or services of the health care plan as they relate to the medical needs of the patient;
    
    (3)  the termination of the physician's, dentist's, or provider's contract with the health care plan or the fact that the physician, dentist, or provider will otherwise no longer be providing medical care, dental care, or health care services under the health care plan; or
    
    (4)  information regarding the availability of facilities, both in-network and out-of-network, for the treatment of the patient's medical condition.
    
    (a-1)  A health maintenance organization may not, as a condition of payment with a physician, dentist, or provider, or in any other manner, require a physician, dentist, or provider to provide a notification form stating that the physician, dentist, or provider is an out-of-network provider to a current, prospective, or former patient, or a person designated by the patient, if the form contains additional information that is intended, or is otherwise required to be presented in a manner that is intended, to intimidate the patient.
    
    (b)  A health maintenance organization may not in any manner penalize, terminate, or refuse to compensate for covered services a physician, dentist, or provider for communicating in a manner protected by this section with a current, prospective, or former patient, or a person designated by a patient.
    
    (c)  A contract provision that violates this section is void.

    (i)  A health maintenance organization that has made a deposit with the comptroller may, at its option, withdraw the deposit or any part of the deposit after substituting a deposit of cash or securities of equal amount and value to the withdrawn deposit or portion of deposit.
