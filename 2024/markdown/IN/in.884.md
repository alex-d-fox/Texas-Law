The reduction must result in the deficiency reserve being eliminated on December 31 of the year for which the 11th annual statement is filed after the company enters into the direct reinsurance agreement.  The required reduction in the deficiency reserve may not exceed the cumulative aggregate amount of 10 percent a year.
    
    (c)  If in any year a stipulated premium company has not reduced its deficiency reserve as required by Subsection (b), the company's board of directors by appropriate action shall increase premium rates by advancing the age of each insured at the date the insured's policy is issued or otherwise equitably adjust premium rates to correct that failure.  The board shall take that action not later than the 30th day after the date the reserves are computed.
