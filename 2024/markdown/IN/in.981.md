    (c)  To regulate and tax surplus lines insurance placed in accordance with this chapter within the meaning and intent of 15 U.S.C. Section 1011 and 15 U.S.C. Chapter 108, this chapter provides an orderly method for each person whose home state is this state for a particular transaction to effect insurance with eligible surplus lines insurers through qualified, licensed, and supervised surplus lines agents in this state, if coverage is not available from authorized and regulated insurers engaged in business in this state, under reasonable and practical safeguards.
