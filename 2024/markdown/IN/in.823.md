    SUBCHAPTER A. GENERAL PROVISIONS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 823.001.  FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  (a)  It is consistent with the public interest and the interest of policyholders to permit insurers to:
    
    (1)  engage in activities that would enable the insurers to make better use of management skills and facilities;
    
    (2)  have free access to capital markets that could provide funds for insurers to use in diversification programs;
    
    (3)  implement sound tax planning conclusions;  and
    
    (4)  serve the changing needs of the public and adapt to changing conditions of the social, economic, and political environment, so that insurers are able to compete effectively and to meet the growing public demand for institutions capable of providing a comprehensive range of financial services.
    
    (b)  The public interest and the interests of policyholders are adversely affected if:
    
    (1)  control of an insurer is sought by persons who would use the control adversely to the interest of policyholders;
    
    (2)  acquisition of control of an insurer substantially lessens competition or creates a monopoly in the insurance business in this state;
    
    (3)  an insurer that is part of a holding company system is caused to enter into transactions or relationships with affiliated companies on terms that are not fair and reasonable;  or
    
    (4)  an insurer pays dividends to shareholders that jeopardize the financial condition of the insurer.
    
    (c)  The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public interest by:
    
    (1)  facilitating the achievement of the objectives described by Subsection (a);
    
    (2)  requiring disclosure of pertinent information relating to and approval of changes in control of an insurer;
    
    (3)  requiring disclosure and approval of material transactions and relationships between the insurer and the insurer's affiliates, including certain dividends to shareholders paid by the insurer; and
    
    (4)  providing standards governing material transactions between the insurer and the insurer's affiliates.
    
    (d)  It is desirable to prevent unnecessary multiple and conflicting regulation of insurers.  In accordance with this purpose and except as provided by this chapter, this state shall exercise regulatory authority under this chapter only with respect to domestic insurers.

    Sec. 823.0147.  GROUP-WIDE SUPERVISION OF INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE INSURANCE GROUPS.  (a)  The commissioner is authorized to act as the group-wide supervisor for any internationally active insurance group under the provisions of this section.
    
    (b)  The commissioner may otherwise acknowledge another regulatory official as the group-wide supervisor where the internationally active insurance group:
    
    (1)  does not have substantial insurance operations in the United States;
    
    (2)  has substantial insurance operations in the United States, but not in this state; or
    
    (3)  has substantial insurance operations in the United States and this state, but the commissioner has determined under the factors in Subsections (e) and (k) that the other regulatory official is the appropriate group-wide supervisor.
    
    (c)  An insurance holding company system that does not otherwise qualify as an internationally active insurance group may request that the commissioner make a determination or acknowledgment as to a group-wide supervisor under this section.
    
    (d)  In cooperation with other state, federal, and international regulatory agencies, the commissioner will identify a single group-wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group.  The commissioner may determine that the commissioner is the appropriate group-wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group that conducts substantial insurance operations concentrated in this state.  The commissioner may acknowledge that a regulatory official from another jurisdiction is the appropriate group-wide supervisor for the internationally active insurance group.
    
    (e)  The commissioner shall consider the following factors when making a determination or acknowledgment under Subsection (d):
    
    (1)  the place of domicile of the insurers within the internationally active insurance group that hold the largest share of the group's written premiums, assets, or liabilities;
    
    (2)  the place of domicile of the top-tiered insurers in the insurance holding company system of the internationally active insurance group;
    
    (3)  the location of the executive offices or largest operational offices of the internationally active insurance group;

    (A)  substantially similar to the system of regulation provided under the laws of this state; or
    
    (B)  otherwise sufficient in terms of providing for group-wide supervision, enterprise risk analysis, and cooperation with other regulatory officials; and
    
    (5)  whether another regulatory official acting or seeking to act as the group-wide supervisor provides the commissioner with reasonably reciprocal recognition and cooperation.
    
    (f)  A commissioner identified under this section as the group-wide supervisor may determine that it is appropriate to acknowledge another supervisor to serve as the group-wide supervisor. The acknowledgment of the group-wide supervisor shall be made after consideration of the factors listed in Subsection (e), and shall be made in cooperation with and subject to the acknowledgment of other regulatory officials involved with supervision of members of the internationally active insurance group, and in consultation with the internationally active insurance group.
    
    (g)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when another regulatory official is acting as the group-wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance group, the commissioner shall acknowledge that regulatory official as the group-wide supervisor.
    
    (h)  The commissioner shall make a determination or acknowledgment as to the appropriate group-wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group under Subsection (d) or (f) in the event of a material change in the internationally active insurance group that results in:
    
    (1)  the internationally active insurance group's insurers domiciled in this state holding the largest share of the group's premiums, assets, or liabilities; or
    
    (2)  this state being the place of domicile of the top-tiered insurers in the insurance holding company system of the internationally active insurance group.
    
    (i)  Under Subchapter H, the commissioner is authorized to collect from any insurer registered under Subchapter B all information necessary to determine whether the commissioner may act as the group-wide supervisor of an internationally active insurance group or if the commissioner may acknowledge another regulatory official to act as the group-wide supervisor.  Prior to issuing a determination that an internationally active insurance group is subject to group-wide supervision by the commissioner, the commissioner shall notify the insurer registered under Subchapter B and the ultimate controlling person within the internationally active insurance group.  The internationally active insurance group shall have not less than 30 days to provide the commissioner with additional information pertinent to the pending determination.  The commissioner may publish on the department's website the identity of internationally active insurance groups that the commissioner has determined are subject to group-wide supervision by the commissioner.
    
    (j)  If the commissioner is the group-wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group, the commissioner is authorized to engage in any of the following group-wide supervision activities:
    
    (1)  assess the enterprise risks within the internationally active insurance group to ensure that:
    
    (A)  the material financial condition and liquidity risks to the members of the internationally active insurance group that are engaged in the business of insurance are identified by management; and
    
    (B)  reasonable and effective mitigation measures are in place;
    
    (2)  request, from any member of an internationally active insurance group subject to the commissioner's supervision, information necessary and appropriate to assess enterprise risk, including information about the members of the internationally active insurance group regarding:
    
    (A)  governance, risk assessment, and management;
    
    (B)  capital adequacy; and
    
    (C)  material intercompany transactions;
    
    (3)  coordinate and, through the authority of the regulatory officials of the jurisdictions where members of the internationally active insurance group are domiciled, compel development and implementation of reasonable measures designed to ensure that the internationally active insurance group is able to timely recognize and mitigate enterprise risks to members of the internationally active insurance group that are engaged in the business of insurance;
    
    (4)  communicate with other state, federal, and international regulatory agencies for members within the internationally active insurance group and share relevant information, subject to the confidentiality provisions of Section [823.011](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=823.011), through supervisory colleges in Section [823.0145](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=823.0145) or otherwise;
    
    (5)  enter into agreements with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered under Subchapter B, any member of the internationally active insurance group, and any other state, federal, and international regulatory agencies for members of the internationally active insurance group, providing the basis for or otherwise clarifying the commissioner's role as group-wide supervisor, including provisions for resolving disputes with other regulatory officials, provided that such agreements or documentation may not serve as evidence in any proceeding to show that any insurer or person within an insurance holding company system not domiciled or incorporated in this state is doing business in this state or is otherwise subject to jurisdiction in this state; and
    
    (6)  other group-wide supervision activities, consistent with the authorities and purposes enumerated above, as considered necessary by the commissioner.
    
    (k)  If the commissioner acknowledges that another regulatory official from a jurisdiction that is not accredited by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners is the group-wide supervisor, the commissioner is authorized to reasonably cooperate, through supervisory colleges or otherwise, with group-wide supervision undertaken by the group-wide supervisor, provided that:
    
    (1)  the commissioner's cooperation is in compliance with the laws of this state; and
    
    (2)  the regulatory official acknowledged as the group-wide supervisor also recognizes and cooperates with the commissioner's activities as a group-wide supervisor for other internationally active insurance groups where applicable.
    
    (l)  Where recognition and cooperation are not reasonably reciprocal under Subsection (k)(2), the commissioner is authorized to refuse recognition and cooperation.
    
    (m)  The commissioner is authorized to enter into agreements with or obtain documentation from any insurer registered under Subchapter B, any affiliate of the insurer, and other state, federal, and international regulatory agencies for members of the internationally active insurance group that provides the basis for or otherwise clarifies a regulatory official's role as group-wide supervisor.
    
    (n)  The commissioner may adopt rules necessary for the administration of this section.
    
    (o)  A registered insurer subject to this section shall be liable for and shall pay the reasonable expenses of the commissioner's participation in the administration of this section, including the engagement of attorneys, actuaries, and any other professionals and all reasonable travel expenses.

The report must, to the best of the ultimate controlling person's knowledge, identify the material risks within the insurance holding company system that may pose enterprise risk to the insurer.

    (f)  An insurer that in the preceding calendar year had direct written and assumed premiums of more than $300 million but less than $500 million and otherwise meets the requirements of Subsection (d) may request an exemption from the reporting requirements of Subsection (a) by filing with the commissioner a written statement describing the undue financial or organizational hardship the insurer would suffer as a result of complying with Subsection (a).

    (E)  files with the commissioner all registration statements and information relating to material changes of the insurance holding company system required under this subchapter, including the financial statements of the ultimate controlling person described by Subdivision (1).
    
    (h)  An exemption under Subsection (g) applies only for the period during which the ultimate controlling person described by Subsection (g)(1) satisfies the requirements of Subsection (g) and expires on the date of a change in control of the insurer described by Subsection (g)(2) involving at least 50 percent of the voting securities of the insurer.  An insurance holding company system may reapply for an exemption under Subsection (g) after the change in control if the system continues to meet the requirements of Subsection (g).

On the request of either the person filing the statement or notice required by Section [823.154](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=823.154), or the domestic insurer, the commissioner shall hold a hearing on a denial.
    
    (b)  In considering whether to approve or deny, the commissioner shall consider whether:
    
    (1)  immediately on the acquisition, change, or divestiture of control the domestic insurer would not be able to satisfy the requirements for the issuance of a new certificate of authority to write the line or lines of insurance for which the insurer holds a certificate of authority;

    (5)  due to a lack of competence, trustworthiness, experience, and integrity of the persons who would control the operation of the domestic insurer, the acquisition or change of control would not be in the interest of the insurer's policyholders and the public;
    
    (5-a)  the divestiture of control may jeopardize the financial stability of the domestic insurer or prejudice the interest of the domestic insurer's policyholders and other claimants; or
    
    (6)  the acquisition, change, or divestiture of control would violate the law of this or another state or the United States.
    
    (c)  If a proposed acquisition, change, or divestiture of control will require the approval of more than one commissioner, the commissioner may participate in a public hearing referred to in this chapter held on a consolidated basis on request of the person filing the statement required by Section [823.154](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=823.154).

(a)  Subject to Section [823.352](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=823.352), the commissioner may order an insurer registered under Subchapter B to produce records, books, or other information papers in the possession of the insurer or an affiliate of the insurer that are necessary to ascertain the financial condition or legality of conduct of the insurer, including the enterprise risk to the insurer by the ultimate controlling party, or by any entity or combination of entities within the insurance holding company system, or by the insurance holding company system on a consolidated basis.
    
    (a-1)  To determine compliance with this chapter, the commissioner may order any insurer registered under Subchapter B to produce information not in the possession of the insurer if the insurer can obtain access to the information pursuant to contractual relationships, statutory obligations, or other methods.  In the event that the insurer is unable to obtain the information requested by the commissioner, the insurer shall provide the commissioner with a detailed explanation of the reason why the insurer is unable to obtain the information, and the identity of the holder of information.  If it appears to the commissioner that the insurer's explanation is without merit, the commissioner may after notice and hearing:
    
    (1)  require the insurer to pay a penalty of not less than $100 for each day the insurer delays producing the information; or
    
    (2)  suspend or revoke the insurer's license.
    
    (b)  If an insurer fails to comply with an order under this section, the commissioner by order may require the examination of each holding company of the insurer and each controlled person or affiliate in the insurer's insurance holding company system if the commissioner has cause to believe that:
    
    (1)  the operations of that person may materially affect the operations, management, or financial condition of any controlled insurer in that system; and
    
    (2)  the commissioner is unable to obtain relevant information from the controlled insurer.

On the failure or refusal of a person to obey a subpoena, the commissioner may petition a court of competent jurisdiction, and on proper showing, the court may enter an order compelling the witness to appear and testify or produce documentary evidence.  Failure to obey the court order is punishable as contempt of court.  A person shall attend as a witness at the place specified in the subpoena, when subpoenaed, at any location in this state.  The person is entitled to the same fees and mileage, if claimed, as a witness in district court.  Fees, mileage, and actual expenses necessarily incurred in securing the attendance of a witness shall be itemized and charged against, and be paid by, the insurer being examined.
    
    (c)  The commissioner shall specify in an order under Subsection (b) the grounds for the examination.  An examination under Subsection (b) shall be confined to matters specified in the order.
    
    (d)  Only the person sought to be examined under Subsection (b) is entitled to seek judicial review of an order under that subsection.
