In developing the list, the commissioner shall consider the list of qualified jurisdictions published through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners committee process.
    
    (b)  In order to determine whether a jurisdiction of an assuming insurer located outside of the United States is eligible to be recognized as a qualified jurisdiction under Subsection (a), the commissioner shall evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of the reinsurance supervisory system of the jurisdiction, both initially and on an ongoing basis, and consider the rights, benefits, and extent of reciprocal recognition afforded by the jurisdiction to reinsurers licensed and domiciled in the United States.

    (d)  For a domestic ceding insurer to qualify for full financial statement credit for reinsurance ceded to a certified reinsurer, the certified reinsurer must maintain security:
    
    (1)  in a form acceptable to the commissioner and consistent with the insurance laws of this state; or
    
    (2)  in a multibeneficiary trust in accordance with Subchapter D, except as otherwise provided.
    
    (e)  If a certified reinsurer maintains a trust under Subchapter D to secure its obligations, and chooses to secure its obligations incurred as a certified reinsurer with a multibeneficiary trust, the certified reinsurer shall maintain separate trust accounts for the obligations incurred under reinsurance agreements the certified reinsurer issued or renewed with reduced security as permitted by this section or comparable laws of other United States jurisdictions and for its obligations subject to Subchapter D.  It is a condition to the grant of certification under Section [493.1033](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=493.1033) that the certified reinsurer has bound itself, by the language of the trust agreement and agreement with the insurance commissioner or other chief insurance regulatory official with principal regulatory oversight over each trust account, to fund, on termination of the trust account, out of the remaining surplus of the trust any deficiency of any other trust account described by this subsection.
    
    (f)  The minimum trusteed surplus requirements provided in Subchapter D do not apply to a multibeneficiary trust described by this section, except that the trust shall maintain a minimum trusteed surplus of $10 million.
    
    (g)  With respect to obligations incurred by a certified reinsurer under this section, if the security is insufficient, the commissioner:
    
    (1)  shall reduce the allowable credit by an amount proportionate to the deficiency; and
    
    (2)  may impose further reductions in allowable credit on finding that there is a material risk that the certified reinsurer's obligations will not be paid in full when due.
    
    (h)  For purposes of this section, a reinsurer whose certification has been revoked, suspended, or voluntarily surrendered or whose certification status has become inactive for any reason shall be treated as a reinsurer required to secure 100 percent of its obligations, except that if the commissioner continues to assign to the reinsurer a higher financial strength rating as permitted by this section, the security requirement does not apply to a reinsurer whose certification has been suspended or whose certification status has become inactive.

(a)  A certified reinsurer that ceases to assume new business in this state may request to maintain its certification in inactive status to continue to qualify for a reduction in security for in-force business.  An inactive certified reinsurer shall continue to comply with all applicable requirements of this section, and the commissioner shall assign a financial strength rating that takes into account, if relevant, the reasons the reinsurer is not assuming new business.
    
    (b)  If an accredited or certified reinsurer ceases to meet the requirements for accreditation or certification, the commissioner may, after notice and opportunity for hearing, suspend or revoke the reinsurer's accreditation or certification.

    (1)  the reinsurer waives its right to hearing;
    
    (2)  the commissioner's order is based on regulatory action by the reinsurer's domiciliary jurisdiction or the voluntary surrender or termination of the reinsurer's eligibility to transact insurance or reinsurance business in its domiciliary jurisdiction or in the primary certifying state of the reinsurer under this section; or
    
    (3)  the commissioner finds that an emergency requires immediate action and a court of competent jurisdiction has not stayed the commissioner's action.
    
    (c)  While a reinsurer's accreditation or certification is suspended, a reinsurance contract issued or renewed after the effective date of the suspension does not qualify for credit except to the extent that the reinsurer's obligations under the contract are secured in accordance with Subchapter D.
    
    (d)  If a reinsurer's accreditation or certification is revoked, credit for reinsurance may not be granted after the effective date of the revocation except to the extent that the reinsurer's obligations under the contract are secured in accordance with Section [493.1036](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=493.1036) or Subchapter D.

    Sec. 493.108.  CREDIT ALLOWED FOR CERTAIN ELIGIBLE ASSUMING INSURERS.  (a) Credit must be allowed when reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that meets the conditions as required by this section.
    
    (b)  The assuming insurer must have its principal office or be domiciled in and be licensed in a reciprocal jurisdiction described by Subsection (c).
    
    (c)  In this section:
    
    (1)  "Reciprocal jurisdiction" means a jurisdiction that is:
    
    (A)  a jurisdiction located outside of the United States or, in the case of a covered agreement between the United States and European Union, a member state of the European Union, that is subject to an in-force covered agreement described by Subdivision (2) with the United States, each within its legal authority;
    
    (B)  a  jurisdiction located in the United States that meets the requirements for accreditation under the National Association of Insurance Commissioners financial regulation standards and accreditation program; or
    
    (C)  a qualified jurisdiction, as determined by the commissioner under Section [493.1035](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=493.1035), that is not otherwise described in Paragraph (A) or (B) and meets certain additional requirements, consistent with the in-force covered agreements as specified by the commissioner by rule.
    
    (2)  "Covered agreement" means an agreement that:
    
    (A)  is entered into under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (31 U.S.C. Sections 313-314);
    
    (B)  is in effect or in a period of provisional application; and
    
    (C)  addresses the elimination, under specified conditions, of collateral requirements as a condition for entering into a reinsurance agreement with a ceding insurer domiciled in this state or allowing the ceding insurer to recognize credit for reinsurance. 
    
    (d)  The assuming insurer must have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, minimum capital and surplus, or its equivalent, calculated according to the methodology of the assuming insurer's domiciliary jurisdiction, in an amount required by the commissioner by rule. If the assuming insurer is an association, including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, the assuming insurer must have and maintain, on an ongoing basis:
    
    (1)  minimum capital and surplus equivalents, net of liabilities, calculated according to the methodology of the assuming insurer's domiciliary jurisdiction; and
    
    (2)  a central fund containing a balance in an amount required by the commissioner by rule.
    
    (e)  The assuming insurer must have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, a minimum solvency or capital ratio, as applicable, required by the commissioner by rule. If the assuming insurer is an association, including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, the association must have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, a minimum solvency or capital ratio in the reciprocal jurisdiction where the assuming insurer has its principal office or is domiciled and is licensed.
    
    (f)  The assuming insurer must agree and provide adequate assurance to the commissioner in a form as required by the commissioner by rule, as follows:
    
    (1)  The assuming insurer must provide prompt written notice and explanation to the commissioner if:
    
    (A)  the assuming insurer no longer meets the minimum requirements under Subsection (d) or (e); or
    
    (B)  any regulatory action is taken against the assuming insurer for serious noncompliance with applicable law;
    
    (2)  The assuming insurer must consent in writing to the jurisdiction of this state's courts and to the appointment of the commissioner as agent for service of process. The commissioner may require that an assuming insurer also include the consent for service of process in each reinsurance agreement to which the assuming insurer is a party. Nothing in this section limits or in any way alters the capacity of parties to a reinsurance agreement to agree to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms except to the extent the agreement is unenforceable under applicable insolvency or delinquency laws;
    
    (3)  The assuming insurer must consent in writing to pay all final judgments, wherever enforcement is sought, obtained by a ceding insurer or its legal successor, that have been declared enforceable in the jurisdiction where the judgment was obtained;
    
    (4)  Each reinsurance agreement must require the assuming insurer to provide security in an amount equal to 100 percent of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded under the reinsurance agreement if the assuming insurer resists enforcement of:
    
    (A)  a final judgment that is enforceable under the law of the jurisdiction in which the judgment was obtained; or
    
    (B)  a properly enforceable arbitration award, whether obtained by the ceding insurer or its legal successor on behalf of the ceding insurer's receivership estate; and
    
    (5)  The assuming insurer must:
    
    (A)  confirm that the assuming insurer is not presently participating in any solvent scheme of arrangement that involves this state's ceding insurers; and
    
    (B)  if the assuming insurer enters into a solvent scheme of arrangement, agree to notify the ceding insurer and the commissioner that the assuming insurer entered into the scheme of arrangement and provide security in an amount equal to 100 percent of the assuming insurer's liabilities to the ceding insurer. The security required by this paragraph must be in a form consistent with the provisions of this subchapter and required by the commissioner by rule.
    
    (g)  On request of the commissioner, the assuming insurer or its legal successor, on behalf of the assuming insurer and any legal predecessor of the assuming insurer, must provide to the commissioner documentation required by the commissioner by rule.
    
    (h)  The assuming insurer must maintain a practice of prompt payment of claims under reinsurance agreements in accordance with criteria established by the commissioner by rule.
    
    (i)  The assuming insurer's supervisory authority must annually confirm to the commissioner, as of the preceding December 31 or the annual date otherwise statutorily reported to the assuming insurer's reciprocal jurisdiction, that the assuming insurer complies with the requirements of  Subsections (d) and (e).
    
    (j)  Nothing in this section prohibits an assuming insurer from voluntarily providing to the commissioner information related to this section.
    
    (k)  The commissioner shall timely develop and publish a list of reciprocal jurisdictions.
    
    (l)  The commissioner's list of reciprocal jurisdictions published under Subsection (k) must include any reciprocal jurisdiction described by Subsection (c)(1)(A) or (B). The commissioner shall consider any other reciprocal jurisdiction on the list of reciprocal jurisdictions published through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners committee process. The commissioner may, in accordance with criteria established by the commissioner by rule, approve a jurisdiction that does not appear on the list of reciprocal jurisdictions published through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners committee process to be placed on the list of reciprocal jurisdictions published under Subsection (k).
    
    (m)  The commissioner may remove a jurisdiction from the list of reciprocal jurisdictions published under Subsection (k) if, in accordance with a process established by the commissioner by rule, the commissioner finds that the jurisdiction ceases to meet the requirements of a reciprocal jurisdiction under this section. Notwithstanding the authority to remove a jurisdiction, the commissioner may not remove from the list a reciprocal jurisdiction described by Subsection (c)(1)(A) or (B). If the commissioner removes a reciprocal jurisdiction from the list published under Subsection (k), credit for reinsurance ceded to an assuming insurer that has its principal office or is domiciled in the removed jurisdiction must be allowed if otherwise allowed under this subchapter.
    
    (n)  The commissioner shall timely develop and publish a list of assuming insurers that satisfy the conditions imposed by this section and to which cessions must be granted credit under Subsection (a). The commissioner may add an assuming insurer to the list developed and published under this subsection if a National Association of Insurance Commissioners' accredited jurisdiction has added the assuming insurer to the accredited jurisdiction's list of eligible assuming insurers or if, on initial eligibility, the assuming insurer submits  to the commissioner the information required by Subsection (f) and complies with any additional requirements imposed by the commissioner by rule except to the extent that the additional requirements conflict with the applicable covered agreement.
    
    (o)  If the commissioner finds that an assuming insurer ceases to meet one or more of the requirements under this section, the commissioner may revoke or suspend the assuming insurer's eligibility under this section in accordance with procedures established by the commissioner by rule.
    
    (p)  If an assuming insurer's eligibility is suspended, no reinsurance agreement issued, amended, or renewed after the effective date of the suspension qualifies for credit during the period of suspension except to the extent that the assuming insurer's obligations under the agreement are secured in accordance with Section [493.104](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=493.104).
    
    (q)  If an assuming insurer's eligibility is revoked, no credit for reinsurance may be granted after the effective date of the revocation with respect to any reinsurance agreements entered into by the assuming insurer, including reinsurance agreements entered into before the date of revocation except to the extent that the assuming insurer's obligations under the contract are secured in a form acceptable to the commissioner and consistent with the provisions of Section [493.104](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=493.104).
    
    (r)  If a ceding insurer is subject to rehabilitation, liquidation, or conservation, the ceding insurer or its representative may seek and, if found appropriate by the court in which the rehabilitation, liquidation, or conservation proceedings are pending, obtain an order requiring the assuming insurer to post security for all outstanding ceded liabilities.
    
    (s)  Nothing in this section limits or in any way alters the capacity of parties to a reinsurance agreement to agree on requirements for security or other terms in that reinsurance agreement, except as expressly prohibited by law.
    
    (t)  This section does not alter or impair a ceding insurer's right to take credit for reinsurance to the extent that credit is not available under this section if the reinsurance otherwise qualifies for credit under this subchapter.
    
    (u)  Nothing in this section authorizes an assuming insurer to withdraw or reduce the security provided under any reinsurance agreement except as permitted by the agreement.
    
    (v)  Nothing in this section limits or in any way alters the capacity of parties to any reinsurance agreement to renegotiate the agreement.
    
    (w)  This section applies only to:
    
    (1)  credit under a reinsurance agreement that is delivered, issued for delivery, or renewed on or after January 1, 2022; and
    
    (2)  losses incurred and reserves reported on or after the later of:
