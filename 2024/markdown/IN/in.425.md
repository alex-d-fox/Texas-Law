    (b)  A life insurance company may not make a new deposit of securities after August 28, 1961, except to the extent expressly required by Section [425.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=425.003).

    (e)  The department may have any securities or real property appraised and valued before the securities or real property may be deposited with or conveyed to the department under this section.  The life insurance company shall pay the reasonable expense of the appraisal or valuation.
    
    (f)  For purposes of state, county, and municipal taxation, the situs of the deposited securities is the municipality and county in which the life insurance company's charter requires the principal business office of the company making the deposit to be located.

    Sec. 425.061.  COMPUTATION OF CALENDAR YEAR STATUTORY VALUATION INTEREST RATE:  GENERAL RULE.  (a)  For purposes of Subsection (b):
    
    (1)  R1 is the lesser of R or.09;
    
    (2)  R2 is the greater of R or.09;
    
    (3)  R is the reference interest rate determined under Section [425.063](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=425.063); and
    
    (4)  W is the weighting factor determined under Section [425.062](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=425.062).
    
    (b)  The calendar year statutory valuation interest rate ("I") is determined as provided by this section, with the results rounded to the nearest one-quarter  of one percent:
    
    (1)  for life insurance:
    
    I =.03 + W(R1 -.03) + (W/2)(R2 -.09); and
    
      
    
    
    (2)  for a single premium immediate annuity or annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from another annuity with a cash settlement option or from a guaranteed interest contract with a cash settlement option, or for an annuity or guaranteed interest contract without a cash settlement option, or for an annuity or guaranteed interest contract with a cash settlement option that is valued on a change in fund basis:
    
    I =.03 + W(R -.03).
    
      
    
    
    (c)  For an annuity or guaranteed interest contract with a cash settlement option that is valued on an issue year basis, other than an annuity or contract described by Subsection (b)(2):
    
    (1)  the formula prescribed by Subsection (b)(1) applies to an annuity or guaranteed interest contract with a guarantee duration determined under Section [425.062](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=425.062)(f) greater than 10 years; and
    
    (2)  the formula prescribed by Subsection (b)(2) applies to an annuity or guaranteed interest contract with a guarantee duration determined under Section [425.062](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=425.062)(f) of 10 years or less.
    
    (d)  Notwithstanding Subsections (b) and (c), if the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for a life insurance policy issued in a calendar year as determined under Subsection (b) or (c), as applicable, would differ  from the corresponding actual rate for similar policies issued in the preceding calendar year by less than one-half of one percent, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for the policy is the corresponding actual rate for the preceding calendar year.  For purposes of this subsection, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for a life insurance policy issued in a calendar year is determined for 1980 using the reference interest rate defined for 1979, and is determined for each subsequent calendar year regardless of whether Subchapter [B](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1105.051), Chapter [1105](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1105), applies to the policy.

    | More than 20| .35|   
      
    (c)  For purposes of Subsection (b), the guarantee duration is the maximum number of years the life insurance can remain in force on a basis guaranteed in the policy or under options to convert to life insurance plans with premium rates or nonforfeiture values, or both, that are guaranteed in the original policy.
    
    (d)  The weighting factor for a single premium immediate annuity or for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from another annuity with a cash settlement option or from a guaranteed interest contract with a cash settlement option is.80.
    
    (e)  The weighting factor for an annuity or a guaranteed interest contract, other than an annuity or contract to which Subsection (d) applies, is determined by the following tables:

    (1)  for an annuity or guaranteed interest contract with a cash settlement option, the guarantee duration is the number of years for which the contract guarantees interest rates greater than the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies with guarantee duration greater than 20 years; and
    
    (2)  for an annuity or guaranteed interest contract without a cash settlement option, the guarantee duration is the number of years from the issue or purchase date to the date annuity benefits are scheduled to begin.
    
    (g)  For purposes of Subsection (e):
    
    (1)  a policy is a "Plan Type A" policy if:
    
    (A)  the policyholder may withdraw funds at any time, but only:
    
    (i)  with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values after the insurance company receives the funds;
    
    (ii)  without an adjustment described by Subparagraph (i), provided that the withdrawal is in installments over five years or more; or
    
    (iii)  as an immediate life annuity; or
    
    (B)  the policyholder is not permitted to withdraw funds at any time;
    
    (2)  a policy is a "Plan Type B" policy if:

    (A)  without an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values after the insurance company receives the funds; or
    
    (B)  subject only to a fixed surrender charge that is a percentage of the fund stipulated in the contract.
    
    (h)  An insurance company may elect to value an annuity or guaranteed interest contract with a cash settlement option on an issue year basis or on a change in fund basis.  A company must value an annuity or guaranteed interest contract without a cash settlement option on an issue year basis.

    Sec. 425.063.  REFERENCE INTEREST RATE.  (a)  In this section, "Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average" means the Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average--Monthly Average Corporates, as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.
    
    (b)  Except as provided by Subsection (g), the reference interest rate for purposes of Section [425.061](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=425.061) is determined as provided by Subsections (c)-(f).
    
    (c)  The reference interest rate for a life insurance policy is the lesser of the average over a period of 36 months or the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year preceding the year of issue, of the Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average.
    
    (d)  The reference interest rate is the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or year of purchase, of the Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average for:
    
    (1)  a single premium immediate annuity or annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from another annuity with a cash settlement option or from a guaranteed interest contract with a cash settlement option;

    (3)  an annuity or guaranteed interest contract without a cash settlement option.
    
    (e)  The reference interest rate is the lesser of the average over a period of 36 months or the average over a period of 12 months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average for an annuity or guaranteed interest contract with a cash settlement option, other than an annuity or contract described by Subsection (d)(1), that is valued on an issue year basis and has a guarantee duration as determined under Section [425.062](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=425.062)(f) greater than 10 years.

    (g)  At least annually, the commissioner shall:
    
    (1)  determine whether the reference interest rates prescribed by Subsections (c), (d), (e), and (f) continue to be a reasonably accurate approximation of the average yield achieved from purchases in the United States in publicly quoted markets of investment grade fixed term and fixed interest corporate obligations for the periods referenced in Subsection (c), (d), (e), or (f), as applicable; and
    
    (2)  if the commissioner determines that a reference interest rate prescribed by Subsection (c), (d), (e), or (f) is not a reasonably accurate approximation of the average yield described by Subdivision (1), adopt rules in the manner prescribed by Chapters [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001) and [2002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2002), Government Code, to prescribe an alternative method of determining a reference interest rate, as appropriate, that is a reasonably accurate approximation of that average yield.

    Sec. 425.064.  COMMISSIONERS RESERVE VALUATION METHOD FOR LIFE INSURANCE AND ENDOWMENT BENEFITS.  (a)  Except as otherwise provided by Sections [425.065](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=425.065) and [425.068](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=425.068) and subject to Subsection (b), for the life insurance and endowment benefits of a policy that provides for a uniform amount of insurance and that requires the payment of uniform premiums, the reserve according to the commissioners reserve valuation method is the difference, if greater than zero, of the present value on the date of valuation of those future guaranteed benefits, minus the present value on that date of any future modified net premiums for a policy described by this subsection.  The modified net premiums for a policy described by this subsection are a uniform percentage of the respective contract premiums for those benefits, so that the present value on the policy's issue date of all the modified net premiums is equal to the sum of:
    
    (1)  the present value on that date of those benefits; and
    
    (2)  the difference, if greater than zero, between:
    
    (A)  a net level annual premium equal to the present value on the policy's issue date of the benefits provided for after the first policy year, divided by the present value on the policy's issue date of an annuity of one per year, payable on the first policy anniversary and on each subsequent policy anniversary on which a premium becomes due; and
    
    (B)  a net one-year term premium for the benefits provided for in the first policy year.
    
    (b)  A net level annual premium under Subsection (a)(2)(A) may not exceed the net level annual premium on the 19-year premium whole life plan for insurance of the same amount at an age that is one year older than the age on the policy's issue date.
    
    (c)  This subsection applies only to a life insurance policy issued on or after January 1, 1985, for which the contract premium for the first policy year exceeds the contract premium for the second year, for which a comparable additional benefit is not provided in the first year for the excess premium, and that provides an endowment benefit, a cash surrender value, or a combination of an endowment benefit and cash surrender value, in an amount greater than the excess premium.  For purposes of this subsection, the "assumed ending date" is the first policy anniversary on which the sum of any endowment benefit and any cash surrender value available on that date is greater than the excess premium.  The reserve according to the commissioners reserve valuation method for a policy to which this subsection applies as of any policy anniversary occurring on or before the assumed ending date is, except as otherwise provided by Section [425.068](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=425.068), the greater of:
    
    (1)  the reserve as of the policy anniversary computed as prescribed by Subsection (a); or
    
    (2)  the reserve as of the policy anniversary computed as prescribed by Subsection (a) but with:
    
    (A)  the value prescribed by Subsection (a)(2)(A) reduced by 15 percent of the amount of the excess first-year premium;
    
    (B)  each present value of a benefit or premium determined without reference to a premium or benefit provided under the policy after the assumed ending date;
    
    (C)  the policy assumed to mature on the assumed ending date as an endowment; and
    
    (D)  the cash surrender value provided on the assumed ending date considered to be an endowment benefit.
    
    (d)  In making the comparison required by Subsection (c), the mortality tables and interest bases described by Sections [425.058](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=425.058), [425.061](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=425.061), [425.062](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=425.062), and [425.063](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=425.063) must be used.
    
    (e)  Reserves according to the commissioners reserve valuation method for the following policies, contracts, and benefits must be computed by a method consistent with the principles of this section:
    
    (1)  a life insurance policy that provides for a varying amount of insurance or that requires the payment of varying premiums;
    
    (2)  a group annuity or pure endowment contract purchased under a retirement or deferred compensation plan established or maintained by an employer, including a partnership or sole proprietorship, by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under Section 408, Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and that section's subsequent amendments;
    
    (3)  disability or accidental death benefits in a policy or contract; and

    (b)  Reserves according to the commissioners annuity reserve method for benefits under an annuity or pure endowment contract, excluding any disability or accidental death benefits in the contract, are the greatest of the respective excesses of the present values on the valuation date of the future guaranteed benefits under the contract at the end of each respective contract year, including guaranteed nonforfeiture benefits, minus the present value on the valuation date of any future valuation considerations derived from future gross considerations that are required by the contract terms and that become payable before the end of the respective contract year.  The future guaranteed benefits must be determined by using the mortality table, if any, and the interest rate or rates specified in the contract for determining guaranteed benefits.  The valuation considerations are the portions of the respective gross considerations applied under the contract terms to determine nonforfeiture values.

    (b)  Reserves for any category, as established by the commissioner, of policies, contracts, or benefits issued by a life insurance company on or after the date on which Chapter [1105](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1105) applies to policies, contracts, or benefits issued by the company, as determined under Section [1105.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1105.002)(a) or (b), may be computed, at the company's option, according to any standard that produces greater aggregate reserves for the category than the minimum aggregate reserves computed according to the standard provided by this subchapter, but the interest rate or rates used for those policies and contracts, other than annuity and pure endowment contracts, may not be higher than the corresponding interest rate or rates used in computing any nonforfeiture benefits provided in those policies or contracts.
    
    (c)  An insurance company that has adopted a standard of valuation that produces greater minimum aggregate reserves than the aggregate reserves computed according to the standard provided by this subchapter may, with the commissioner's approval, adopt any lower standard of valuation that produces aggregate reserves at least equal to the minimum aggregate reserves computed according to the standard provided by this subchapter.
    
    (d)  For purposes of this section, the holding of additional reserves previously determined to be necessary to issue a favorable opinion under Section [425.054](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=425.054) may not be considered to be the adoption of a higher standard of valuation.

    Sec. 425.068.  RESERVE COMPUTATION: GROSS PREMIUM CHARGED LESS THAN VALUATION NET PREMIUM.  (a)  If in a contract year the gross premium charged by a life insurance company on a policy or contract is less than the valuation net premium for the policy or contract computed by the method used in computing the reserve on the policy or contract but using the minimum valuation mortality standards and interest rate, the minimum reserve required for the policy or contract is the greater of:
    
    (1)  the reserve computed according to the mortality table, interest rate, and method actually used for the policy or contract; or
    
    (2)  the reserve computed by the method actually used for the policy or contract but using the minimum valuation mortality standards and interest rate and replacing the valuation net premium with the actual gross premium in each contract year for which the valuation net premium exceeds the actual gross premium.
    
    (b)  The minimum valuation mortality standards and interest rate under Subsection (a) are the standards and rate provided by Sections [425.058](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=425.058), [425.061](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=425.061), [425.062](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=425.062), and [425.063](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=425.063).
    
    (c)  This subsection applies only to a life insurance policy issued on or after January 1, 1985, for which the gross premium for the first policy year exceeds the gross premium for the second policy year, for which a comparable additional benefit is not provided in the first year for the excess premium, and that provides an endowment benefit, a cash surrender value, or a combination of an endowment benefit and cash surrender value, in an amount greater than the excess premium.  For a policy to which this subsection applies, Subsections (a) and (b) shall be applied as if the method actually used in computing the reserve for the policy were the method described in Section [425.064](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=425.064), ignoring Section [425.064](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=425.064)(c).  The minimum reserve at each policy anniversary is the greater of:
    
    (1)  the minimum reserve computed in accordance with Section [425.064](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=425.064), including Section [425.064](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=425.064)(c); or
    
    (2)  the minimum reserve computed in accordance with this section.

    Sec. 425.069.  RESERVE COMPUTATION:  INDETERMINATE PREMIUM PLANS AND CERTAIN OTHER PLANS.  (a)  For a life insurance plan that provides for future premium determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurance company based on estimates of future experience, or a life insurance plan or annuity for which the minimum reserves cannot be determined by the methods described by Sections [425.064](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=425.064), [425.065](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=425.065), and [425.068](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=425.068), the reserves held must:
    
    (1)  be appropriate in relation to the benefits and the pattern of premiums for the plan; and
    
    (2)  be computed by a method that is consistent with the principles of this subchapter, as determined by commissioner rule.
    
    (b)  Notwithstanding any other provision of state law, the commissioner must affirmatively approve a policy, contract, or certificate that provides life insurance under a plan described by Subsection (a) before the policy, contract, or certificate may be marketed, issued, delivered, or used in this state.

    Sec. 425.070.  COMPUTATION OF RESERVE FOR CERTAIN POLICIES BY CALENDAR YEAR OF ISSUE.  (a)  The reserve for a policy or contract issued by a life insurance company before the date on which Chapter [1105](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1105) would apply to the policy or contract, as determined under Section [1105.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1105.002)(a) or (b), must be computed in accordance with the terms of the policy or contract and this section.
    
    (b)  For a policy issued before January 1, 1910, the computation must be based on the American Experience Table of Mortality and 4-1/2 percent annual interest.
    
    (c)  For a policy issued on or after January 1, 1910, and before January 1, 1948, the computation must be based on:
    
    (1)  the Actuaries or Combined Experience Table of Mortality and four percent annual interest, if the interest rate guaranteed in the policy is four percent annually or higher; or
    
    (2)   the American Experience Table of Mortality and the lower rate specified in the policy, if the policy was issued on a reserve basis of an interest rate lower than four percent annually.
    
    (d)  For a policy issued on or after January 1, 1948, the computation must be based on the mortality table and interest rate specified in the policy, provided that:
    
    (1)  the specified interest rate may not exceed 3-1/2 percent annually;
    
    (2)  the specified table for a policy, other than an industrial life insurance policy, is the American Experience Table of Mortality, the American Men Ultimate Table of Mortality, the Commissioners 1941 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table, or, for a policy issued after December 31, 1959, the Commissioners 1958 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table; and
    
    (3)  the specified table for an industrial life insurance policy is the American Experience Table of Mortality, the Standard Industrial Mortality Table, the Sub-Standard Industrial Mortality Table, the 1941 Standard Industrial Mortality Table, or the 1941 Sub-Standard Industrial Mortality Table, or, for a policy issued after December 31, 1963, the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table.
    
    (e)  For a policy, other than an industrial life insurance policy, issued after December 31, 1959, to insure a female risk, the computation must be based on any mortality table and interest rate permitted under Subsection (d) and specified in the policy but may, at the insurance company's option, be based on an age not more than three years younger than the insured's actual age.
    
    (f)  Except as otherwise provided by Section [425.059](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=425.059) for coverage purchased under a group annuity or pure endowment contract to which that section applies, for a policy issued on a substandard risk, an annuity contract, or a contract or policy for disability benefits or accidental death benefits, the computation must be based on the standards and methods adopted by the insurance company and approved by the commissioner.
    
    (g)  For a group insurance policy issued before May 15, 1947, the computation must be based on the American Men Ultimate Table of Mortality with interest at the rate of three percent or 3-1/2 percent annually as provided by the policy.  The reserve value of a group insurance policy issued on or after May 15, 1947, and before January 1, 1961, must be computed on the basis of either the American Men Ultimate Table of Mortality or the Commissioners 1941 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with interest at a rate not to exceed 3-1/2 percent annually as provided by the policy.  For a group insurance policy issued on or after January 1, 1961, the computation must be based on an interest rate not to exceed 3-1/2 percent annually and the mortality table adopted by the insurance company with the commissioner's approval.

    (g)  In the absence of a specific valuation requirement or if a specific valuation requirement in the valuation manual does not in the commissioner's opinion comply with this subchapter, the company shall, with respect to the requirement, comply with minimum valuation standards prescribed by the commissioner by rule.
    
    (h)  The commissioner may employ or contract with a qualified actuary, at the expense of the company, to perform an actuarial examination of the company and provide an opinion concerning the appropriateness of any reserve assumption or method used by the company, or to review and provide an opinion on a company's compliance with any requirement of this subchapter.  The commissioner may rely on the opinion, regarding provisions contained within this subchapter, of a qualified actuary engaged by the insurance supervisory official of another state.

    (1)  quantify the benefits and guarantees, and the funding, associated with the contracts and their risks at a level of conservatism that reflects conditions that include unfavorable events that have a reasonable probability of occurring during the terms of the contracts;
    
    (2)  with respect to policies and contracts with significant tail risk, reflect conditions appropriately adverse to quantify the tail risk;
    
    (3)  incorporate assumptions, risk analysis methods, and financial models and management techniques that are consistent with those used in the company's overall risk assessment process, while recognizing potential differences in financial reporting structures and any prescribed assumptions or methods;
    
    (4)  incorporate assumptions:
    
    (A)  prescribed by the valuation manual; or

    (ii)  to the extent that the company data is not available, relevant, or statistically credible, using other relevant, statistically credible experience; and
    
    (5)  provide margins for uncertainty, including adverse deviation and estimation error, such that the greater the uncertainty the larger the margin and resulting reserve.
    
    (b)  A company using a principle-based valuation for one or more policies or contracts subject to this section and as specified by the valuation manual shall:
    
    (1)  establish procedures for corporate governance and oversight of the actuarial valuation function consistent with procedures specified by the valuation manual;
    
    (2)  provide to the commissioner and the company's board of directors an annual certification of the effectiveness of the internal controls with respect to the principle-based valuation; and
    
    (3)  develop, and file with the commissioner on request, a principle-based valuation report that complies with standards prescribed in the valuation manual.
    
    (c)  A company's internal controls with respect to the principle-based valuation must be designed to ensure that all material risks inherent in the liabilities and associated assets subject to the valuation are included in the valuation, and that valuations are made in accordance with the valuation manual.  The certification described by Subsection (b)(2) must be based on the controls in place as of the end of the preceding calendar year.

    (e)  An insurer may not make an investment in production payments, producing royalties, or producing overriding royalties solely for the production of income if, after making the investment, the insurer's total investment at cost in the production payments, producing royalties, or producing overriding royalties would exceed 10 percent of the insurer's admitted assets as of December 31 preceding the date of the investment.
    
    (f)  If production in paying quantities from a royalty interest or overriding royalty interest held by an insurer ends, the insurer shall sell and dispose of the royalty or overriding royalty not later than the second anniversary of the date the production ends, unless:
    
    (1)  production in paying quantities has resumed; or
    
    (2)  the insurer obtains from the commissioner a certificate stating that the insurer's interests will suffer materially by the forced sale of the interest.

(a)  In this section, "improved income-producing real property" includes all commercial and industrial real property, a substantial portion of which has been materially enhanced in value by the construction of durable, permanent-type buildings and other improvements costing an amount at least equal to the value of the real property, excluding the buildings and improvements, that is held or acquired by purchase, lease, or otherwise for the production of income.  The term does not include agricultural, horticultural, farm and ranch, or residential property, or single or multiunit family dwelling property.
    
    (b)  Notwithstanding Sections [425.229](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=425.229), [425.230](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=425.230), and [425.231](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=425.231), subject to this section, a domestic insurer may:
    
    (1)  invest any of the insurer's funds and accumulations in improved income-producing real property or any interest in improved income-producing real property; and
    
    (2)  hold, improve, maintain, manage, lease, sell, or convey improved income-producing real property or an interest in improved income-producing real property.
    
    (c)  The aggregate amount of an insurer's investments in all income-producing real property, including improvements, may not exceed 15 percent of the insurer's admitted assets.  The amount of an insurer's investment in a single piece of improved income-producing real property, including  improvements, may not exceed five percent of the insurer's admitted assets.  For purposes of this subsection, an insurer's admitted assets are determined from the insurer's annual statement as of the preceding December 31 and filed with the department as required by law.  Section [425.229](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=425.229)(f) applies to the value of any investment made under this section.

    (e)  This section does not permit an insurer to purchase undeveloped real property for the purpose of development or subdivision.
