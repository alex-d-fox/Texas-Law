    Sec. 1451.208.  PRIOR AUTHORIZATION OF DENTAL CARE SERVICES.  (a)  For purposes of this section, "prior authorization" means a written and verifiable determination that one or more specific dental care services are covered under the patient's employee benefit plan or health insurance policy and are payable and reimbursable in a specific stated amount, subject to applicable coinsurance and deductible amounts.  The term:

    (2)  does not include a predetermination as defined by Section [1451.207](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1451.207)(c).
    
    (b)  For services for which a prior authorization is required, on request of a patient or treating dentist, an employee benefit plan or health insurance policy provider or issuer shall provide to the dentist a written prior authorization of benefits for a dental care service for the patient.  The prior authorization must include a specific benefit payment or reimbursement amount.  Except as provided by Subsection (c), the plan or policy provider or issuer may not pay or reimburse the dentist in an amount that is less than the amount stated in the prior authorization.
    
    (c)  An employee benefit plan or health insurance policy provider or issuer that preauthorizes a dental care service under Subsection (b) may deny a claim for the dental care service or reduce payment or reimbursement to the dentist for the service only if:
    
    (1)  the denial or reduction is in accordance with the patient's employee benefit plan or health insurance policy benefit limitations, including an annual maximum or frequency of treatment limitation, and the patient met the benefit limitation after the date the prior authorization was issued;
    
    (2)  the documentation for the claim fails to reasonably support the claim as preauthorized;
    
    (3)  the preauthorized dental care service was not medically necessary based on the prevailing standard of care on the date of the service, or is subject to denial under the conditions for coverage under the patient's plan or policy in effect at the time the service was preauthorized, because of a change in the patient's condition or because the patient received additional dental care services after the date the prior authorization was issued;
    
    (4)  a payor other than the employee benefit plan or health insurance policy provider or issuer is responsible for payment of the claim;
    
    (5)  the dentist received full payment for the preauthorized dental care service on which the claim is based;
    
    (6)  the claim is fraudulent;
    
    (7)  the prior authorization was based wholly or partly on a material error in information provided to the employee benefit plan or health insurance policy provider or issuer by any person not related to the provider or issuer; or
    
    (8)  the patient was otherwise ineligible for the dental care service under the patient's plan or policy, and the plan or policy provider or issuer did not know and could not reasonably have known that the patient was ineligible for the dental care service on the date the plan or policy provider or issuer preauthorized the dental care service.

    (1)  the provider network contract conspicuously states that the provider or issuer or contracting entity may enter into an agreement with a third party that allows the third party to obtain the provider's, issuer's, or contracting entity's rights and responsibilities as if the third party were the provider, issuer, or contracting entity;
    
    (2)  if the contracting entity is an employee benefit plan or health insurance policy provider or issuer, the provider network contract conspicuously states, in addition to the language required by Subdivision (1), that the dentist may elect not to participate in third party access to the provider network contract:
    
    (A)  at the time the provider network contract is entered into; or
    
    (B)  when there are material modifications to the provider network contract relevant to granting a third party access to the provider network contract;
    
    (3)  the third party accessing the provider network contract agrees to comply with all of the original contract's terms, including the contracted fee schedule and obligations concerning patient steerage;
    
    (4)  the provider, issuer, or other contracting entity provides in writing to the dentist the names of all third parties with access to the provider network in existence as of the date the contract is entered into;
    
    (5)  the provider, issuer, or other contracting entity identifies all current third parties with access to the provider network on its Internet website with a list updated at least once every 90 days;
    
    (6)  the provider, issuer, or other contracting entity requires a third party with access to the provider network to identify the source of any discount on all remittance advices or explanations of payment under which a discount is taken, provided that this subsection does not apply to electronic transactions mandated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (Pub. L. No. 104-191);
    
    (7)  the provider, issuer, or other contracting entity provides written or electronic notice to network dentists that a third party will lease, acquire, or obtain access to the provider network at least 30 days before the lease or access takes effect;
    
    (8)  the provider, issuer, or other contracting entity provides written or electronic notice to network dentists of the termination of the provider network contract at least 30 days before the termination date;
    
    (9)  a third party's right to a dentist's discounted rate ceases as of the termination date of the provider network contract; and
    
    (10)  the provider, issuer, or other contracting entity makes available a copy of the provider network contract relied on in the adjudication of a claim to a network dentist not later than the 30th day after the date the dentist requests a copy of that contract.
    
    (c)  Subsections (b)(7) and (8) do not apply to a contracting entity that only organizes and leases networks but does not engage in the business of insurance.
    
    (d)  A person may not bind or require a dentist to perform dental care services under a provider network contract that has been sold, leased, or assigned to a third party or for which a third party has otherwise obtained provider network access in violation of this section.
    
    (e)  This section does not apply:
    
    (1)  if access to a provider network contract is granted to:

    (B)  an entity that is an affiliate of the employee benefit plan provider, health insurance policy issuer, or other contracting entity selling or leasing the provider network contract, provided that:
    
    (i)  the provider, issuer, or entity publicly discloses the names of the affiliates on its Internet website; and
