    Sec. 1372.003.  COVERAGE REQUIRED.  (a)  Subject to Subsection (b), a health benefit plan must provide coverage for biomarker testing for the purpose of diagnosis, treatment, appropriate management, or ongoing monitoring of an enrollee's disease or condition to guide treatment when the test is supported by the following kinds of medical and scientific evidence:
