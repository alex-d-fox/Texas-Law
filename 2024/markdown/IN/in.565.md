    CHAPTER 565.  PROHIBITED RATING CRITERIA
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 565.001.  PURPOSE.  (a)  The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the use of environmental, social, or governance models, scores, factors, or standards to define acts or practices that may be unfair discrimination in the business of insurance in this state.
    
    (b)  The legislature finds that there are numerous entities that have developed different environmental, social, or governance models, scores, factors, or standards that are used to:
    
    (1)  evaluate financial risks for investments in certain businesses or industries; or
    
    (2)  encourage or discourage business dealings or investments with certain types of businesses or industries.
    
    (c)  To the extent that the use of such models, scores, factors, or standards are not based on sound actuarial principles, or do not bear a reasonable relationship to the expected loss and expense experience related to insurance risks, the rating of certain businesses or risks in this state without an ordinary insurance business purpose may adversely affect the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, or the public health and safety of this state or a portion of this state.
