    "Notice:  This health care sharing ministry facilitates the sharing of medical expenses and is not an insurance company, and neither its guidelines nor its plan of operation is an insurance policy.  Whether anyone chooses to assist you with your medical bills will be totally voluntary because no other participant will be compelled by law to contribute toward your medical bills.  As such, participation in the ministry or a subscription to any of its documents should never be considered to be insurance.  Regardless of whether you receive any payment for medical expenses or whether this ministry continues to operate, you are always personally responsible for the payment of your own medical bills.  Complaints concerning this health care sharing ministry may be reported to the office of the Texas attorney general."
