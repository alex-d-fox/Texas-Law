    (b)  The commissioner shall approve or disapprove the contract not later than the 30th day after the date the contract is filed, or within a reasonable extended period that the commissioner specifies by notice given within the 30-day period.
    
    (c)  The contract must state that:
    
    (1)  the contract may not be canceled without cause without at least 90 days' prior written notice;
    
    (2)  notice of any cancellation must be sent simultaneously to the commissioner by certified mail; and

    (d)  The management contractor proposing to contract shall provide to the commissioner information sufficient to allow the commissioner to determine the competence, fitness, or reputation of each of the contractor's officers and directors or other person having control of the contractor, including criminal history information demonstrating that none of those individuals has been convicted of a felony involving moral turpitude or breach of fiduciary duty.
    
    (e)  The commissioner shall disapprove the proposed contract if the commissioner determines that the contract authorizes a person who is not sufficiently trustworthy, competent, experienced, and free from conflict of interest to manage the network with due regard for the interests of employers, employees, creditors, or the public.
    
    (f)  The commissioner may not approve a proposed management contract unless the management contractor has in force in the management contractor's own name a fidelity bond on the contractor's officers and employees in the amount of $250,000 or a greater amount prescribed by the commissioner.
    
    (g)  The fidelity bond must be issued by an insurer authorized to engage in business in this state and must be filed with the department.  If the commissioner determines that a fidelity bond is not available from an insurer authorized to engage in business in this state, the management contractor may obtain a fidelity bond procured by a surplus lines agent under Chapter [981](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=981).
    
    (h)  The fidelity bond must obligate the surety to pay any loss of money or other property or damage that the network sustains because of an act of fraud or dishonesty by an employee or officer of the management contractor during the period that the management contract is in effect.
    
    (i)  In lieu of a fidelity bond, and at the commissioner's discretion, the management contractor may deposit with the comptroller cash or readily marketable liquid securities acceptable to the commissioner.

The carrier shall provide to the employee all information required by Section [1305.451](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1305.451).

    (d)  Each network shall, by contract, require treating doctors to provide, at a minimum, the functions and services for injured employees described by this section.
    
    (e)  A treating doctor shall provide health care to the employee for the employee's compensable injury and shall make referrals to other network providers, or request referrals to out-of-network providers if medically necessary services are not available within the network.  Referrals to out-of-network providers must be approved by the network.  The network shall approve a referral to an out-of-network provider not later than the seventh day after the date on which the referral is requested, or sooner if circumstances and the condition of the employee require expedited approval.  If the network denies the referral request, the employee may appeal the decision through the network's complaint process under Subchapter I.

The following does not constitute an initial choice of treating doctor:
    
    (1)  a doctor salaried by the employer;
    
    (2)  a doctor providing emergency care; or

    (b)  An employee who is dissatisfied with the initial choice of a treating doctor is entitled to select an alternate treating doctor from the network's list of treating doctors who provide services within the service area in which the injured employee lives by notifying the network in the manner prescribed by the network.  The network may not deny a selection of an alternate treating doctor.
    
    (c)  An employee who is dissatisfied with an alternate treating doctor must obtain authorization from the network to select any subsequent treating doctor.  The network shall establish procedures and criteria to be used in authorizing an employee to select subsequent treating doctors.  The criteria must include, at a minimum, whether:
    
    (1)  treatment by the current treating doctor is medically inappropriate;
    
    (2)  the employee is receiving appropriate medical care to reach maximum medical improvement or medical care in compliance with the network's treatment guidelines; and
    
    (3)  a conflict exists between the employee and the current treating doctor to the extent that the doctor-patient relationship is jeopardized or impaired.
    
    (d)  Denial of a request for any subsequent treating doctor is subject to the appeal process for a complaint filed under Subchapter I.
    
    (e)  For purposes of this section, the following do not constitute the selection of an alternate or any subsequent treating doctor:
    
    (1)  a referral made by the treating doctor, including a referral for a second or subsequent opinion;
    
    (2)  the selection of a treating doctor because the original treating doctor:
    
    (A)  dies;
    
    (B)  retires; or
    
    (C)  leaves the network; or
    
    (3)  a change of treating doctor required because of a change of address by the employee to a location outside the service area distance requirements, as described by Section [1305.302](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1305.302)(g).
    
    (f)  A network shall provide that an injured employee with a chronic, life-threatening injury or chronic pain related to a compensable injury may apply to the network's medical director to use a nonprimary care physician specialist that is in the network as the injured employee's treating doctor.
    
    (g)  An application under Subsection (f) must:
    
    (1)  include information specified by the network, including certification of the medical need provided by the nonprimary care physician specialist; and
    
    (2)  be signed by the injured employee and the nonprimary care physician specialist interested in serving as the injured employee's treating doctor.
    
    (h)  To be eligible to serve as the injured employee's treating doctor, a physician specialist must agree to accept the responsibility to coordinate all of the injured employee's health care needs.
    
    (i)  If a network denies a request under Subsection (f), the injured employee may appeal the decision through the network's established complaint resolution process under Subchapter I.

    (e)  An insurance carrier shall notify in writing a network provider if the carrier contests the compensability of the injury for which the provider provides health care services.  A carrier may not deny payment for health care services provided by a network provider before that notification on the grounds that the injury was not compensable.  Payment for medically necessary health care services provided prior to written notification of a compensability denial is not subject to denial, recoupment, or refund from a network provider based on compensability.

    (2)  the amount of reimbursement the health care provider will be paid after the health care provider agent's fee for providing administrative services is applied.
    
    (g)  If a management contractor or third party to which the network delegates a function is serving as an agent for health care providers in the certified network, the management contractor or third party must disclose that relationship in its contract with the certified network.

(a)  The requirements of Chapter [4201](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=4201) apply to utilization review conducted in relation to claims in a workers' compensation health care network.
