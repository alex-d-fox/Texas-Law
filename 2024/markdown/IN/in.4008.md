    CHAPTER 4008.  AGENT CERTIFICATION AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR COMPLEX INSURANCE PRODUCTS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 4008.001.  PURPOSE.  Certain insurance products are so complex that the general agent licensing and continuing education requirements are insufficient to ensure the level of agent expertise necessary to safeguard consumer interests.  Agents should be equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to assist insureds appropriately in their purchases.  Requiring agent training or demonstration of knowledge before an agent may sell particularly complex products mitigates the negative impact caused by agents selling complex products without the training and knowledge necessary to sell those products in a manner that is fair and beneficial to insureds.
