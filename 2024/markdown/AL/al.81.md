The commission may deny an application for an original or renewal permit or license as provided by Section [11.43](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=AL&Value=11.43) if the commission finds that, at any time during the 12 months preceding the permit or license application, a common nuisance existed on the premises for which the permit or license is sought, regardless of whether the acts constituting the common nuisance were engaged in by the applicant or whether the applicant controlled the premises at the time the common nuisance existed.  The commission may issue an original or renewal permit or license if it is found that the applicant did not control the premises at the time the common nuisance existed and the applicant has taken reasonable measures to abate the common nuisance.

An order issued under this section is effective until:
    
    (1)  the expiration of the time for appealing the determination under Section [81.004](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=AL&Value=81.004) or [81.005](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=AL&Value=81.005); or
    
    (2)  if the determination is appealed, until all appeals are finally decided.
    
    (b)  A hearings officer may issue an order under this section on the hearings officer's own motion or the motion of a person listed in Section [81.003](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=AL&Value=81.003) or, for an original or renewal permit or license application, any individual entitled to protest the issuance of the original or renewal permit or license.
    
    (b-1)  If an individual who is entitled to protest the issuance of the original or renewal permit or license files a motion for a temporary order under this section, the commission may not issue a temporary order without conducting a hearing.
    
    (c)  The commission may impose any sanction on a person who violates an order issued under Subsection (a) that is necessary to secure compliance with the order.
    
    (d)  A hearing under this section must be held not later than the 10th day after the date notice is served on all interested parties.  Failure to hold a hearing in the time prescribed by this subsection does not invalidate an order issued under this section.
    
    (e)  A person who requests an order under this section may not be required to post security for costs in connection with the application or any hearing conducted as a result of the application.
