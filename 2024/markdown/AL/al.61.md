    Sec. 61.02.  NATURE OF LICENSE;  SUCCESSION ON DEATH, BANKRUPTCY, ETC.  (a)  A license issued under this code is a purely personal privilege and is subject to revocation as provided in this code.  It is not property, is not subject to execution, does not pass by descent or distribution, and ceases on the death of the holder.
    
    (b)  On the death of the licensee or of a person having an interest in the license, or on bankruptcy, receivership, or partnership dissolution, the receiver or successor in interest may apply to the county judge of the county where the licensed premises are located for certification that he is the receiver or successor in interest.  On certification, unless good cause for refusal is shown, the commission or administrator shall grant permission, by letter or otherwise, for the receiver or successor in interest to operate the business during the unexpired portion of the license.  The license may not be renewed, but the receiver or successor in interest may apply for an original license.  A receiver or successor in interest operating for the unexpired portion of the license is subject to the provisions of this code relating to the suspension or cancellation of a license.

    (b)  A secondary license or certificate which requires the holder of the license or certificate to first obtain another license, including a retailer late hours certificate, expires on the same date the basic or primary license expires.  The commission may not prorate or refund any part of the fee for the secondary license or certificate if the application of this section results in the expiration of the license in less than two years.
    
    (c)  An action by the commission resulting in the suspension of a basic or primary license also acts to suspend any secondary license held by the holder of the basic or primary license.
    
    (d)  The commission by rule may require that the expiration date for an individual license holder's license is the first anniversary of the date on which the license is issued due to the license holder's violation history.
    
    (e)  The commission may issue a license with an expiration date less than two years after the date the license is issued in order to maintain a reasonable annual distribution of renewal application review work and license fees.  If the commission issues a license with an expiration date less than two years after the date the license is issued, the commission shall prorate the license fee on a monthly basis so that the license holder pays only that portion of the license fee that is allocable to the number of months during which the license is valid.

    Sec. 61.36.  LOCAL FEE AUTHORIZED.  (a)  The governing body of an incorporated city or town may levy and collect a fee for each license issued for premises located within the city or town.  The commissioners court of a county may levy and collect a fee for each license issued for premises located within the county.  The fees authorized by this subsection may not exceed  one-half the statutory fee provided in this code as of August 31, 2021, for the license issued.  Those authorities may not levy or collect any other fee or tax from the licensee except general ad valorem taxes, the hotel occupancy tax levied under Chapter [351](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=351), Tax Code, and the local sales and use tax levied under Chapter [321](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=321), Tax Code.

    (b-2)  A city, town, or county may enter into an interlocal agreement with another entity authorized to levy a fee under this section for the collection of a license fee that is more than 60 days past due on behalf of the other entity and shall remit the appropriate fees collected to the other entity.  The amount collected through an interlocal agreement under this subsection may not exceed the amount of the fee levied by the city, town, or county under this section and any collection charge assessed by a private attorney or a public or private vendor under Subsection (b-1).
    
    (c)  Nothing in this code shall be construed as a grant to any political subdivision of the authority to regulate licensees except by collecting the fees authorized in this section and exercising those powers granted to political subdivisions by other provisions of this code.
    
    (d)  The commission or administrator may cancel or the commission may deny an application for a license for the retail sale of alcoholic beverages, including a license held by the holder of a food and beverage certificate, if it finds that the license holder or applicant has not paid delinquent ad valorem taxes due on that licensed premises or due from a business operated on that premises to any taxing authority in the county of the premises.  For purposes of this subsection, a license holder or applicant is presumed delinquent in the payment of taxes due if the license holder or applicant:
    
    (1)  is placed on a delinquent tax roll prepared under Section [33.03](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=33.03), Tax Code;

    (b)  Not later than the 30th day after the date a prospective applicant for a license issued by the commission requests certification, the city secretary or clerk of the city in which the request is made shall certify whether the location or address given in the request is in a wet area and whether the sale of alcoholic beverages for which the license is sought is prohibited by charter or ordinance.
    
    (c)  Once a license is issued, the certification that the location or address is in a wet area may not be changed until after a subsequent local option election to prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages.
    
    (d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this code, if the county clerk, city secretary, or city clerk certifies that the location or address given in the request is not in a wet area or refuses to issue the certification required by this section, the prospective applicant is entitled to a hearing before the county judge to contest the certification or refusal to certify.  The prospective applicant must submit a written request to the county judge for a hearing under this subsection.  The county judge shall conduct a hearing required by this subsection not later than the 30th day after the date the county judge receives the written request.
