    Sec. 11.38.  LOCAL FEE AUTHORIZED.
    
    (a)  The governing body of a city or town may levy and collect a fee for each permit issued for premises located within the city or town.  The commissioners court of a county may levy and collect a fee for each permit issued for premises located within the county. The fees authorized by this subsection may not exceed  one-half the statutory fee provided in this code as of August 31, 2021, for the permit issued. Those authorities may not levy or collect any other fee or tax from the permittee except general ad valorem taxes, the hotel occupancy tax levied under Chapter [351](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=351), Tax Code, and the local sales and use tax levied under Chapter [321](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=321), Tax Code.
    
    (b)  The commission or administrator may cancel or suspend a permit if it finds that the permittee has not paid a fee levied under this section within 180 days after the date the fee was levied.  A permittee who sells an alcoholic beverage without first having paid a fee levied under this section commits a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than $10 nor more than $200.
    
    (b-1)  A city, town, or county may enter into a contract with a private attorney or a public or private vendor for the collection of an unpaid permit fee levied under this section that is more than 60 days past due.  A private attorney or a public or private vendor collecting a fee under this subsection may assess a collection charge to a permit holder for late payment or nonpayment of a fee levied under this section.
    
    (b-2)  A city, town, or county may enter into an interlocal agreement with another entity authorized to levy a fee under this section for the collection of a permit fee that is more than 60 days past due on behalf of the other entity and shall remit the appropriate fees collected to the other entity.  The amount collected through an interlocal agreement under this subsection may not exceed the amount of the fee levied by the city, town, or county under this section and any collection charge assessed by a private attorney or a public or private vendor under Subsection (b-1).
    
    (c)  Nothing in this code shall be construed as a grant to any political subdivision of the authority to regulate permittees except by collecting the fees authorized in this section and exercising those powers granted to political subdivisions by other provisions of this code.
    
    (d)  The following are exempt from the fee authorized in this section:
    
    (1)  passenger transportation, carrier, private club registration, and local cartage permits; and
    
    (2)  a mixed beverage permit during the three-year period following the issuance of the permit.
    
    (e)  The commission or administrator may cancel or the commission may deny a permit for the retail sale or service of alcoholic beverages, including a permit held by the holder of a food and beverage certificate, if it finds that the permit holder or applicant has not paid delinquent ad valorem taxes due on that permitted premises or due from a business operated on that premises to any taxing authority in the county of the premises.  For purposes of this subsection, a permit holder or applicant is presumed delinquent in the payment of taxes due if the permit holder or applicant:
    
    (1)  is placed on a delinquent tax roll prepared under Section [33.03](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=33.03), Tax Code;
    
    (2)  has received a notice of delinquency under Section [33.04](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=33.04), Tax Code; and
    
    (3)  has not made a payment required under Section [42.08](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=42.08), Tax Code.

However, the retail floor and display space included in the licensed premises may be in two separate locations within the retail premises if the total retail floor and display space included in the licensed premises does not exceed 20 percent of the floor and display space of the entire premises and each of the two portions of floor and display space included in the licensed premises is itself compact and contiguous and not gerrymandered.  In addition to the one or two separate locations of retail floor and display space on the premises, the licensed premises may include the cash register and check-out portions of the premises provided that (1) no alcoholic beverages are displayed in the check-out or cash register portion of the premises, and (2) the area of the check-out and cash register portions of the premises are counted towards the total of 20 percent of the retail floor and display space that may be dedicated to the sale and display of wine and malt beverages.  A storage area that is not accessible or visible to the public may be included in the licensed premises but shall not be considered retail floor and display space for purposes of this section.

    (4)  the permittee's or licensee's previous violations.
    
    (h)  The length of a suspension may not be based on:
    
    (1)  the volume of alcoholic beverages sold;
    
    (2)  the receipts of the business;
    
    (3)  the taxes paid;  or

The commission shall adopt rules addressing when suspension may be imposed pursuant to this section without the opportunity to pay a civil penalty.  In adopting rules under this subsection, the commission shall consider the type of license or permit held, the type of violation, any aggravating or ameliorating circumstances concerning the violation, and any past violations of this code by the permittee or licensee.  In cases in which a civil penalty is assessed, the commission or administrator shall determine the amount of the penalty.  The amount of the civil penalty may not be less than $150 or more than $25,000 for each day the permit or license was to have been suspended.  If the licensee or permittee does not pay the penalty before the sixth day after the commission or administrator notifies him of the amount, the commission or administrator shall impose the suspension.
    
    (b)  In the case of a violation of this code by a permittee or a licensee, the commission or administrator may relax any provision of the code relating to the suspension or cancellation of the permit or license and assess a sanction the commission or administrator finds just under the circumstances, and the commission or administrator may reinstate the license or permit at any time during the period of suspension on payment by the permittee or licensee of a fee of not less than $75 nor more than $500, if the commission or administrator finds that any of the circumstances described in Subsection (c) exists.
    
    (c)  The following circumstances justify the application of Subsection (b):
    
    (1)  that the violation could not reasonably have been prevented by the permittee or licensee by the exercise of due diligence;
    
    (2)  that the permittee or licensee was entrapped;
    
    (3)  that an agent, servant, or employee of the permittee or licensee violated this code without the knowledge of the permittee or licensee;
    
    (4)  that the permittee or licensee did not knowingly violate this code;
    
    (5)  that the permittee or licensee has demonstrated good faith, including the taking of actions to rectify the consequences of the violation and to deter future violations;  or
    
    (6)  that the violation was a technical one.
    
    (d)  Fees and civil penalties received by the commission under this section shall be deposited in the general revenue fund.
