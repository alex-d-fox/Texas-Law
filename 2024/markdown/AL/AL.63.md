    Sec. 63.01.  AUTHORIZED ACTIVITIES.  The holder of a nonresident brewer's license may transport malt beverages into Texas only to holders of brewer's or distributor's licenses.  The nonresident brewer's licensee may transport the malt beverages in carriers or vehicles operated by holders of carrier's permits or in motor vehicles owned or leased by the nonresident brewer.  The malt beverages must be shipped in barrels or other containers in accordance with the provisions of this code and may not be shipped into the state in tank cars.

    Sec. 63.03.  LIABILITY FOR TAXES; BOND.  The holder of a nonresident brewer's license that transports malt beverages into Texas in a motor vehicle owned or leased by the licensee is not primarily responsible for the payment of the taxes on the malt beverages, which remains the responsibility of the holder of the brewer's or distributor's license.  However, the nonresident brewer shall furnish the commission with a bond in an amount which, in the commission's judgment, will protect the revenue of the state from the tax due on the malt beverages over any six-week period.
