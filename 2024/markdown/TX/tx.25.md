    CHAPTER 25. LOCAL APPRAISAL
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 25.01.  PREPARATION OF APPRAISAL RECORDS.  (a)  By May 15 or as soon thereafter as practicable, the chief appraiser shall prepare appraisal records listing all property that is taxable in the district and stating the appraised value of each.
    
    (b)  The chief appraiser with the approval of the board of directors of the district may contract with a private appraisal firm to perform appraisal services for the district, subject to his approval.  A contract for private appraisal services is void if the amount of compensation to be paid the private appraisal firm is contingent on the amount of or increase in appraised, assessed, or taxable value of property appraised by the appraisal firm.
    
    (c)  A contract for appraisal services for an appraisal district is invalid if it does not provide that copies of the appraisal, together with supporting data, must be made available to the appraisal district and such appraisals and supporting data shall be public records.  "Supporting data" shall not be construed to include personal notes, correspondence, working papers, thought processes, or any other matters of a privileged or proprietary nature.

(a)  The chief appraiser for each appraisal district shall prepare and maintain a record of property specially appraised under Chapter [23](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=23) of this code and subject, in the future, to additional taxation for change in use or status.
    
    (b)  The record for each type of specially appraised property must be maintained in a separate document for each 12-month period beginning June 1.  The document must include the name of at least one owner of the property, the acreage of the property, and other information sufficient to identify the property as required by the comptroller.  All entries in each document must be kept in alphabetical order according to the last name of each owner whose name is part of the record.

    Sec. 25.02.  FORM AND CONTENT.  (a)  The appraisal records shall be in the form prescribed by the comptroller and shall include:
    
    (1)  the name and address of the owner or, if the name or address is unknown, a statement that it is unknown;
    
    (2)  real property;
    
    (3)  separately taxable estates or interests in real property, including taxable possessory interests in exempt real property;
    
    (4)  personal property;
    
    (5)  the appraised value of land and, if the land is appraised as provided by Subchapter C, D, E, or H, Chapter [23](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=23), the market value of the land;
    
    (6)  the appraised value of improvements to land;
    
    (7)  the appraised value of a separately taxable estate or interest in land;
    
    (8)  the appraised value of personal property;
    
    (9)  the kind of any partial exemption the owner is entitled to receive, whether the exemption applies to appraised or assessed value, and, in the case of an exemption authorized by Section [11.23](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.23), the amount of the exemption;
    
    (10)  the tax year to which the appraisal applies;  and
    
    (11)  an identification of each taxing unit in which the property is taxable.
    
    (b)  A mistake in the name or address of an owner does not affect the validity of the appraisal records, of any appraisal or tax roll based on them, or of the tax imposed.  The mistake may be corrected as provided by this code.
    
    (c)  Each appraisal record must have a unique account number.  If an appraisal district changes the account number of an appraisal record, the appraisal district must provide written notice of the change to the property owner as soon as practicable after the change and provide notice of the change in the next notice of appraised value of the property included in the record that is delivered to the property owner under Section [25.19](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=25.19).
    
    (d)  This subsection does not apply to an appraisal record for a residential property, for an improvement only, or for a property on which a delinquent tax is due.  On the written request of a property owner, the chief appraiser shall combine contiguous parcels or tracts of the owner's real property into a single appraisal record.  On the written request of a property owner, the chief appraiser shall separate identifiable segments of the owner's parcel or tract of real property into individual appraisal records.
    
    (e)  A property owner must make a request under Subsection (d) before January 1 of the tax year for which the requested change to the appraisal records is to be made.  The request must contain a legal description as contained in a deed sufficient to describe the property subject to the request.
    
    (f)  If a chief appraiser refuses to combine parcels or tracts, or separate a parcel or tract, on request of a property owner under Subsection (d), the appraisal review board may order the requested change on a motion filed by the property owner under Section [25.25](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=25.25) or a protest filed under Chapter [41](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41).
    
    (g)  The combination of contiguous parcels or tracts of real property into a single appraisal record or the separation of identifiable segments of a parcel or tract of real property into individual appraisal records under this section does not affect the application of generally accepted appraisal methods and techniques to the appraisal of real property associated with those appraisal records, including real property that is part of the same economic unit as real property contained in the same or another appraisal record.

    (b)  The chief appraiser may change the appraisal roll at any time to correct a name or address, a determination of ownership, a description of property, multiple appraisals of a property, an erroneous denial or cancellation of any exemption authorized by Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13) if the applicant or recipient is disabled or is 65 or older or an exemption authorized by Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13)(q), [11.131](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.131), or [11.22](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.22), or a clerical error or other inaccuracy as prescribed by board rule that does not increase the amount of tax liability.  Before the 10th day after the end of each calendar quarter, the chief appraiser shall submit to the appraisal review board and to the board of directors of the appraisal district a written report of each change made under this subsection that decreases the tax liability of the owner of the property.  The report must include:
    
    (1)  a description of each property; and
    
    (2)  the name of the owner of that property.
    
    (c)  The appraisal review board, on motion of the chief appraiser or of a property owner, may direct by written order changes in the appraisal roll for any of the five preceding years to correct:
    
    (1)  clerical errors that affect a property owner's liability for a tax imposed in that tax year;
    
    (2)  multiple appraisals of a property in that tax year;
    
    (3)  the inclusion of property that does not exist in the form or at the location described in the appraisal roll; or
    
    (4)  an error in which property is shown as owned by a person who did not own the property on January 1 of that tax year.
    
    (c-1)  The appraisal review board, on motion of the chief appraiser or of a property owner, may direct by written order changes in the appraisal roll or related appraisal records for the current tax year and for either of the two preceding tax years to correct an inaccuracy in the appraised value of the owner's tangible personal property that is the result of an error or omission in a rendition statement or property report filed under Chapter [22](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=22) for the applicable tax year.  The roll may not be changed under this subsection for any tax year in which:
    
    (1)  the property owner failed to timely file the rendition statement or property report in accordance with Section [22.23](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=22.23) and was assessed a penalty under Section [22.28](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=22.28);
    
    (2)  the property was the subject of a protest brought by the property owner under Chapter [41](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41), a hearing on the protest was conducted in which the owner offered evidence or argument, and the appraisal review board made a determination of the protest on the merits;
    
    (3)  the property was the subject of a previous motion filed by the property owner under this section and the chief appraiser and the owner agreed to the correction, the appraisal review board determined the motion, or the appraisal review board determined that the owner forfeited the right to a final determination of the motion for failing to comply with the prepayment requirements of Section [25.26](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=25.26); or
    
    (4)  the appraised value of the property was established as a result of a written agreement between the property owner or the owner's agent and the appraisal district.
    
    (d)  At any time prior to the date the taxes become delinquent, a property owner or the chief appraiser may file a motion with the appraisal review board to change the appraisal roll to correct an error that resulted in an incorrect appraised value for the owner's property.  However, the error may not be corrected unless it resulted in an appraised value that exceeds by more than:
    
    (1)  one-fourth the correct appraised value, in the case of property that qualifies as the owner's residence homestead under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13); or
    
    (2)  one-third the correct appraised value, in the case of property that does not qualify as the owner's residence homestead under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13).
    
    (d-1)  If the appraisal roll is changed under Subsection (d), the property owner must pay to each affected taxing unit a late-correction penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount of taxes as calculated on the basis of the corrected appraised value.  Payment of the late-correction penalty is secured by the lien that attaches to the property under Section [32.01](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=32.01) and is subject to enforced collection under Chapter [33](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=33).  The roll may not be changed under Subsection (d) if:
    
    (1)  the property was the subject of a protest brought by the property owner under Chapter [41](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41), a hearing on the protest was conducted in which the property owner offered evidence or argument, and the appraisal review board made a determination of the protest on the merits; or
    
    (2)  the appraised value of the property was established as a result of a written agreement between the property owner or the owner's agent and the appraisal district.
    
    (e)  If the chief appraiser and the property owner do not agree to the correction before the 15th day after the date the motion is filed, a party bringing a motion under Subsection (c), (c-1), or (d) is entitled on request to a hearing on and a determination of the motion by the appraisal review board.  A party bringing a motion under this section must describe the error or errors that the motion is seeking to correct.  If a request for hearing is made on or after January 1 but before  September 1, the appraisal review board shall schedule the hearing to be held as soon as practicable but not later than the 90th day after the date the board approves the appraisal records as provided by Section [41.12](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41.12).  If a request for hearing is made on or after September 1 but before January 1 of the following tax year, the appraisal review board shall schedule the hearing to be held as soon as practicable but not later than the 90th day after the date the request for the hearing is made.  Not later than 15 days before the date of the hearing, the board shall deliver written notice of the date, time, and place of the hearing to the chief appraiser, the property owner, and the presiding officer of the governing body of each taxing unit in which the property is located.  The chief appraiser, the property owner, and each taxing unit are entitled to present evidence and argument at the hearing and to receive written notice of the board's determination of the motion.  The property owner is entitled to elect to present the owner's evidence and argument before, after, or between the cases presented by the chief appraiser and each taxing unit.  A property owner who files the motion must comply with the payment requirements of Section [25.26](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=25.26) or forfeit the right to a final determination of the motion.
    
    (f)  The chief appraiser shall certify each change made as provided by this section to the assessor for each unit affected by the change within five days after the date the change is entered.
    
    (g)  Within 60 days after receiving notice of the appraisal review board's determination of a motion under this section or of a determination of the appraisal review board that the property owner has forfeited the right to a final determination of a motion under this section for failing to comply with the prepayment requirements of Section [25.26](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=25.26), the property owner or the chief appraiser may file suit to compel the board to order a change in the appraisal roll as required by this section.  A taxing unit may not be made a party to a suit filed by a property owner or chief appraiser under this subsection.
    
    (g-1)  In a suit filed under Subsection (g), if a hearing to review and determine compliance with Section [25.26](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=25.26) is requested, the movant must mail notice of the hearing by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the collector for each taxing unit that imposes taxes on the property not later than the 45th day before the date of the hearing.
    
    (g-2)  Regardless of whether the collector for the taxing unit receives a notice under Subsection (g-1), a taxing unit that imposes taxes on the property may intervene in a suit filed under Subsection (g) and participate in the proceedings for the limited purpose of determining whether the property owner has complied with Section [25.26](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=25.26).  The taxing unit is entitled to process for witnesses and evidence and to be heard by the court.
    
    (h)  The appraisal review board, on the joint motion of the property owner and the chief appraiser filed at any time prior to the date the taxes become delinquent, shall by written order correct an error that resulted in an incorrect appraised value for the owner's property.
    
    (i)  A person who acquires property after January 1 of the tax year at issue is entitled to file any motion that this section authorizes the person who owned the property on January 1 of that year to file, if the deadline for filing the motion has not passed.
    
    (j)  If during the pendency of a motion under this section the ownership of property subject to the motion changes, the new owner of the property is entitled to proceed with the motion in the same manner as the property owner who filed the motion.
    
    (k)  The chief appraiser shall change the appraisal records and school district appraisal rolls promptly to reflect the detachment and annexation of property among school districts under Subchapter C or G, Chapter [49](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=49), Education Code.
    
    (l)  A motion may be filed under Subsection (c) regardless of whether, for a tax year to which the motion relates, the owner of the property protested under Chapter [41](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41) an action relating to the value of the property that is the subject of the motion.
    
    (m)  The hearing on a motion under Subsection (c), (c-1), or (d) shall be conducted in the manner provided by Subchapter [C](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41.41), Chapter [41](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41).

    Sec. 25.26.  FORFEITURE OF REMEDY FOR NONPAYMENT OF TAXES.  (a)  The pendency of a motion filed under Section [25.25](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=25.25) does not affect the delinquency date for the taxes on the property that is the subject of the motion.  However, that delinquency date applies only to the amount of taxes required to be paid under Subsection (b).  If the property owner complies with Subsection (b), the delinquency date for any additional amount of taxes due on the property is determined in the manner provided by Section [42.42](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=42.42)(c) for the determination of the delinquency date for additional taxes finally determined to be due in an appeal under Chapter [42](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=42), and that additional amount is not delinquent before that date.
    
    (b)  Except as provided by Subsection (d), a property owner who files a motion under Section [25.25](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=25.25) must pay the amount of taxes due on the portion of the taxable value of the property that is the subject of the motion that is not in dispute before the delinquency date or the property owner forfeits the right to proceed to a final determination of the motion.
    
    (c)  A property owner who pays an amount of taxes greater than that required by Subsection (b) does not forfeit the property owner's right to a final determination of the motion by making the payment.  If the property owner files a timely motion under Section [25.25](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=25.25), taxes paid on the property are considered paid under protest, even if paid before the motion is filed.
    
    (d)  After filing an oath of inability to pay the taxes at issue, a property owner may be excused from the requirement of prepayment of tax as a prerequisite to the determination of a motion if the appraisal review board, after notice and hearing, finds that such prepayment would constitute an unreasonable restraint on the property owner's right of access to the board.  On the motion of a party, the board shall determine compliance with this section in the same manner and by the same procedure as provided by Section [41.4115](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41.4115)(d) and may set such terms and conditions on any grant of relief as may be reasonably required by the circumstances.
