The comptroller may require any individual seeking exemption under this section to present information establishing qualification for the exemption.
    
    (b-1)  The seller of a motor vehicle may not collect the tax from the purchaser of the motor vehicle if the purchaser:

    (A)  is on a form designated by the comptroller; and
    
    (B)  contains all information the comptroller considers reasonable to establish qualification for the exemption at the time of sale; and

    (b-2)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or other law, the seller of a motor vehicle may rely on a properly executed and signed exemption certificate under Subsection (b-1) and does not have a duty to investigate the propriety of an exemption certificate that is valid on the certificate's face.  A seller who relies on an exemption certificate as provided by this subsection is not liable for the payment of motor vehicle sales taxes that would otherwise be due as a result of a motor vehicle sale.
    
    (c)  If the comptroller finds that the motor vehicle is not used primarily for the purposes specified in this Act or that the exemption should not have been granted, the comptroller shall assess the tax in an amount that would have been due had the exemption not been given under this section.
