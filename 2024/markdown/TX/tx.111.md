    (b)  Sampling auditing methods are appropriate if:
    
    (1)  the taxpayer's records are so detailed, complex, or voluminous that an audit of all detailed records would be unreasonable or impractical;
    
    (2)  the taxpayer's records are inadequate or insufficient, so that a competent audit for the period in question is not otherwise possible;  or
    
    (3)  the cost of an audit of all detailed records to the taxpayer or to the state will be unreasonable in relation to the benefits derived, and sampling procedures will produce a reasonable result.
    
    (c)  Before using a sample technique to establish a tax liability, the comptroller or his designee must notify the taxpayer in writing of the sampling procedure to be used.
    
    (d)  The sample must reflect as nearly as possible the normal conditions under which the business was operated during the period to which the audit applies.  If a taxpayer can demonstrate that a transaction in a sample period is not representative of the taxpayer's business operations, the transaction shall be eliminated from the sample and be separately assessed in the audit.  If records are inadequate to reflect accurately the business operations of the taxpayer, the comptroller or his designee shall determine the best information available and base his audit report on that information.
    
    (e)  If the taxpayer demonstrates that any sampling method used by the comptroller was not in accordance with generally recognized sampling techniques, the audit will be dismissed as to that portion of the audit established by projection based upon the sampling method, and a new audit may be performed.

    (2)  "Taxpayer" means the person whose tax obligation the comptroller is seeking to determine.
    
    (b)(1) Before a determination of or a hearing on a taxpayer's tax obligation, if any, the comptroller may issue a subpoena addressed to the sheriff or constable of any county in this state to require any person who the comptroller determines may provide assistance in the examination of a taxpayer's tax obligation to appear at the place and time stated in the subpoena for the taking of his oral deposition before an official authorized to take depositions.  The subpoena may require the person to produce at the time of the deposition books, documents, records, papers, accounts, and other objects as may be specified by the comptroller.  The subpoena must include a statement setting out the reason why the requested material is needed.
    
    (2)  The deposition shall be taken in the county of the person's residence or in the county where the person is employed or regularly transacts business.  The subpoena shall specify that the person shall remain in attendance from day to day until the deposition is begun and completed.
    
    (3)  The officer taking the oral deposition may not sustain objections to any of the testimony taken or exclude any of it.
    
    (4)  When the testimony is fully transcribed, the deposition shall be submitted to the person for examination and read to or by the person, unless the examination and reading are waived in writing by the person and by the comptroller.  However, if the person is represented by an attorney of record, the deposition officer shall notify the attorney of record in writing by registered mail or certified mail that the deposition is ready for examination and reading at the office of the deposition officer.  If the person does not appear and examine, read, and sign the deposition within 10 days after the mailing of the notice, the deposition shall be returned and may be used as fully as though signed.  The officer shall enter on the deposition any changes in form or substance that the person desires to make and a statement of the reasons given by the person for making them.  The deposition shall then be signed by the person, unless the person and the comptroller by stipulation waive the signing or the person is ill, cannot be found, or refuses to sign.  If the deposition is not signed by the person, the officer shall sign it and state on the record the fact of the waiver, illness, or absence of the person or the fact of the refusal to sign, together with the reason, if any, given for failure to sign.  The deposition may then be used as fully as though signed.
    
    (5)  The deposition shall be returned to the comptroller by the official taking the deposition either by mail or by delivering it in person.
    
    (c)  Before a determination of or a hearing on a taxpayer's tax obligation, if any, the comptroller may:
    
    (1)  issue a subpoena addressed to the sheriff or constable of any county in this state to require any person to produce at the place and time stated in the subpoena books, documents, records, papers, accounts, and other objects that the comptroller determines may assist in an examination of a person's tax obligation;
    
    (2)  issue an order to a person to permit entry upon designated land or other property in his possession or control for the purpose of inspecting, measuring, surveying, or photographing the property or any designated object or operation on the property that may be material to any matter involved in the examination;  the order must specify the time, place, and manner of making the inspection, measurement, or survey and taking the copies and photographs and may prescribe any terms and conditions that are just;
    
    (3)  copy or conduct a complete examination of books, documents, records, papers, accounts, and other objects that are produced as a result of the subpoenas or orders specified in this section;  and
    
    (4)  serve or have served by his designated agent any subpoena or order issued under this section by delivering a copy of the subpoena to the person.
    
    (d)  A person, other than the taxpayer, who is subpoenaed to give a deposition or to produce books, records, papers, or other objects under the authority of this section is entitled to receive after presentation of a voucher sworn by the person and approved by the comptroller:
    
    (1)  mileage of 20 cents a mile, or a greater amount as prescribed by agency rule, for going to and returning from the place of the hearing or the place where the deposition is taken, if the place is more than 25 miles from the person's place of residence;  and
    
    (2)  a fee of $20 a day, or a greater amount as prescribed by agency rule, for each day or part of a day the person is necessarily present as a deponent.
    
    (e)  If a person fails to comply with a subpoena or order issued under this section, the comptroller may:
    
    (1)  acting through the attorney general, bring suit to enforce the subpoena or order in a district court of Travis County;  the court, if it determines that good cause exists for the issuance of a subpoena or order, shall order the compliance with the requirements of the subpoena or order;  failure to obey the order of the court may be punishable by the court as contempt;
    
    (2)  use records, books, papers, and other documents obtained or depositions taken under this section only in an administrative hearing of the comptroller or a judicial proceeding brought by or against the comptroller;  the information may be made available to the federal government or to another state under an exchange agreement;  and
    
    (3)  delegate his authority to issue subpoenas or orders and to participate in the taking of depositions as specified in this section to any attorney employed by him.
    
    (f)  If a foreign corporation doing business in this state has such contact with this state that it becomes subject to the taxes administered and collected by the comptroller and fails to appoint or maintain a registered agent in this state, or if the registered agent cannot with reasonable diligence be found at the registered office, then the secretary of state shall be an agent of the corporation and may be served with any subpoena or other order issued under this section in the manner provided for service of process in Article 8.10, Texas Business Corporation Act, as amended.
    
    (g)  Any person, including the taxpayer, shall be entitled to obtain upon request a copy of any statement he has previously made concerning the examination or its subject matter and which is in the possession, custody, or control of the comptroller.

    (1)  before the expiration of the 14-day period allowed for the notice not to comply under Subsection (b)(2) of this section;  or
    
    (2)  when the requirements of Subsection (b)(2) of this section have been met, except in accordance with an order issued by a district court of Travis County authorizing examination of the records or with the consent of the person staying compliance.

    (g)(1) A district court of Travis County has jurisdiction to hear and determine proceedings brought under Subsection (e) or (f) of this section.  The determinations required to be made under Subsections (e) and (f) of this section shall be ex parte and shall be made solely upon the petition and supporting affidavits.  An order denying the petition shall be deemed a final order that may be appealed.

    (b)  The purchaser of a business or stock of goods who fails to withhold an amount of the purchase price as required by this section is liable for the amount required to be withheld to the extent of the value of the purchase price.

    Sec. 111.051.  REPORTS AND PAYMENTS;  DUE DATES;  METHOD OF PAYMENT.  (a)  The comptroller may set the date for filing a report for and making a payment of a tax imposed by this title.
    
    (b)  A date set by the comptroller under this section prevails over a different date prescribed by this title for the filing of a report for or the payment of a tax, except that the comptroller may only set a report or payment date for the state sales and use tax that conflicts with the dates prescribed by Chapter [151](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=151) of this code in case of public calamity or natural disaster.
    
    (c)  The comptroller may require that all payments from a taxpayer who files tax reports monthly and remits three or more dishonored or insufficient funds checks or drafts within a six-month period be remitted using certified instruments.

In this subsection, "certified instruments" includes cashier's checks and money orders.  The comptroller shall send written notice of a payment restriction under this subsection to the taxpayer at the business address shown on the comptroller's records.  A failure to remit a payment by a certified instrument after imposition of the payment restriction by the comptroller is grounds for the suspension and revocation of a permit or license as provided by Section [111.0047](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=111.0047) of this code.

At any time before the expiration of the period agreed on, the refund may be made, the tax may be assessed and collected, or an action may be commenced in any court to collect the amount delinquent.
    
    (b)  The extended period agreed on under Subsection (a) of this section may be extended by subsequent agreements made before the expiration of the extended period.  All subsequent agreements must set forth the reasons for extending the period.

    (3)  without an extension, circumstances beyond the control of either the comptroller or the taxpayer would make an audit by the comptroller impractical or burdensome for either party;  or
    
    (4)  an issue of law involved in the audit is awaiting determination in either litigation or an administrative proceeding.
    
    (e)  If, during an extended period agreed on under Subsection (a) of this section, the comptroller finds that an amount of tax, penalty, or interest has been unlawfully or erroneously collected, the comptroller shall credit the amount against any other amount then due and payable by the taxpayer from whom the amount was collected.  The remainder of the amount if any may be refunded to the taxpayer.
