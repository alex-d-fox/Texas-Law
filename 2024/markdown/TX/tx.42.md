A property owner is not required to file a notice of appeal under this section.

    Sec. 42.08.  FORFEITURE OF REMEDY FOR NONPAYMENT OF TAXES.  (a)  The pendency of an appeal as provided by this chapter does not affect the delinquency date for the taxes on the property subject to the appeal.  However, that delinquency date applies only to the amount of taxes required to be paid under Subsection (b).  If the property owner complies with Subsection (b), the delinquency date for any additional amount of taxes due on the property is determined by Section [42.42](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=42.42)(c), and that additional amount is not delinquent before that date.
    
    (b)  Except as provided in Subsection (d), a property owner who appeals as provided by this chapter must pay taxes on the property subject to the appeal in the amount required by this subsection before the delinquency date or the property owner forfeits the right to proceed to a final determination of the appeal.  The amount of taxes the property owner must pay on the property before the delinquency date to comply with this subsection is the lesser of:
    
    (1)  the amount of taxes due on the portion of the taxable value of the property that is not in dispute;
    
    (2)  the amount of taxes due on the property under the order from which the appeal is taken; or
    
    (3)  the amount of taxes imposed on the property in the preceding tax year.
    
    (b-1)  This subsection applies only to an appeal in which the property owner elects to pay the amount of taxes described by Subsection (b)(1).  The appeal filed by the property owner must be accompanied by a statement in writing of the amount of taxes the property owner proposes to pay.  The failure to provide the statement required by this subsection is not a jurisdictional error.
    
    (c)  A property owner that pays an amount of taxes greater than that required by Subsection (b) does not forfeit the property owner's right to a final determination of the appeal by making the payment.  The property owner may pay an additional amount of taxes at any time.  If the property owner files a timely appeal under this chapter, taxes paid on the property are considered paid under protest, even if paid before the appeal is filed.  If the taxes are subject to the split-payment option provided by Section [31.03](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=31.03), the property owner may comply with Subsection (b) of this section by paying one-half of the amount otherwise required to be paid under that subsection before December 1 and paying the remaining one-half of that amount before July 1 of the following year.
    
    (d)  After filing an oath of inability to pay the taxes at issue, a party may be excused from the requirement of prepayment of tax as a prerequisite to appeal if the court, after notice and hearing, finds that such prepayment would constitute an unreasonable restraint on the party's right of access to the courts.  On the motion of a party and after the movant's compliance with Subsection (e), the court shall hold a hearing to review and determine compliance with this section, and the reviewing court may set such terms and conditions on any grant of relief as may be reasonably required by the circumstances.  If the court determines that the property owner has not substantially complied with this section, the court shall dismiss the pending action.  If the court determines that the property owner has substantially but not fully complied with this section, the court shall dismiss the pending action unless the property owner fully complies with the court's determination within 30 days of the determination.
    
    (e)  Not later than the 45th day before the date of a hearing to review and determine compliance with this section, the movant must mail notice of the hearing by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the collector for each taxing unit that imposes taxes on the property.
    
    (f)  Regardless of whether the collector for the taxing unit receives a notice under Subsection (e), a taxing unit that imposes taxes on the property may intervene in an appeal under this chapter and participate in the proceedings for the limited purpose of determining whether the property owner has complied with this section.  The taxing unit is entitled to process for witnesses and evidence and to be heard by the court.

    SUBCHAPTER B. REVIEW BY DISTRICT COURT
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 42.21.  PETITION FOR REVIEW.  (a)  A party who appeals as provided by this chapter must file a petition for review with the district court within 60 days after the party received notice that a final order has been entered from which an appeal may be had or at any time after the hearing but before the 60-day deadline.  Failure to timely file a petition bars any appeal under this chapter.
    
    (b)  A petition for review brought under Section [42.02](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=42.02) must be brought against the owner of the property involved in the appeal.  A petition for review brought under Section [42.031](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=42.031) must be brought against the appraisal district and against the owner of the property involved in the appeal.  A petition for review brought under Section [42.01](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=42.01)(a)(2) or [42.03](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=42.03) must be brought against the comptroller.  Any other petition for review under this chapter must be brought against the appraisal district.  A petition for review may not be brought against the appraisal review board.  An appraisal district may hire an attorney that represents the district to represent the appraisal review board established for the district to file an answer and obtain a dismissal of a suit filed against the appraisal review board in violation of this subsection.
    
    (c)  If an appeal under this chapter is pending when the appraisal review board issues an order in a subsequent year under a protest by the same property owner and that protest relates to the same property that is involved in the pending appeal, the property owner may appeal the subsequent appraisal review board order by amending the original petition for the pending appeal to include the grounds for appealing the subsequent order.  The amended petition must be filed with the court in the period provided by Subsection (a) for filing a petition for review of the subsequent order.  A property owner may appeal the subsequent appraisal review board order under this subsection or may appeal the order independently of the pending appeal as otherwise provided by this section, but may not do both.  A property owner may change the election of remedies provided by this subsection at any time before the end of the period provided by Subsection (a) for filing a petition for review.
    
    (d)  An appraisal district is served by service on the chief appraiser at any time or by service on any other officer or employee of the appraisal district present at the appraisal office at a time when the appraisal office is open for business with the public.  An appraisal review board is served by service on the chairman of the appraisal review board.  Citation of a party is issued and served in the manner provided by law for civil suits generally.
    
    (e)  A petition that is timely filed under Subsection (a) or amended under Subsection (c) may be subsequently amended to:
    
    (1)  correct or change the name of a party;  or
    
    (2)  not later than the 120th day before the date of trial, identify or describe the property originally involved in the appeal.
    
    (f)  A petition filed by an owner or lessee of property may include multiple properties that are owned or leased by the same person and are of a similar type or are part of the same economic unit and would typically sell as a single property.  If a petition is filed by multiple plaintiffs or includes multiple properties that are not of a similar type, are not part of the same economic unit, or are part of the same economic unit but would not typically sell as a single property, the court may on motion and a showing of good cause sever the plaintiffs or the properties.
    
    (g)  A petition filed by an owner or lessee of property may be amended to include additional properties in the same county that are owned or leased by the same person, are of a similar type as the property originally involved in the appeal or are part of the same economic unit as the property originally involved in the appeal and would typically sell as a single property, and are the subject of an appraisal review board order issued in the same year as the order that is the subject of the original appeal.  The amendment must be filed within the period during which a petition for review of the appraisal review board order pertaining to the additional properties would be required to be filed under Subsection (a).
    
    (h)  The court has jurisdiction over an appeal under this chapter brought on behalf of a property owner or lessee and the owner or lessee is considered to have exhausted the owner's or lessee's administrative remedies regardless of whether the petition correctly identifies the plaintiff as the owner or lessee of the property or correctly describes the property so long as the property was the subject of an appraisal review board order, the petition was filed within the period required by Subsection (a), and the petition provides sufficient information to identify the property that is the subject of the petition.  Whether the plaintiff is the proper party to bring the petition or whether the property needs to be further identified or described must be addressed by means of a special exception and correction of the petition by amendment as authorized by Subsection (e) and may not be the subject of a plea to the jurisdiction or a claim that the plaintiff has failed to exhaust the plaintiff's administrative remedies.  If the petition is amended to add a plaintiff, the court on  motion shall enter a docket control order to provide proper deadlines in response to the addition of the plaintiff.

    Sec. 42.221.  CONSOLIDATED APPEALS FOR MULTICOUNTY PROPERTY.  (a)  The owner of property of a telecommunications provider, as defined by Section [51.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=51.002), Utilities Code, or the owner of property regulated by the Railroad Commission of Texas, the federal Surface Transportation Board, or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that runs through or operates in more than one county and is appraised by more than one appraisal district may appeal an order of an appraisal review board relating to the property running through or operating in more than one county to the district court of any county in which a portion of the property is located or operated if the order relating to that portion of the property is appealed.
    
    (b)  A petition for review of each appraisal review board order under this section must be filed with the court as provided by Section [42.21](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=42.21).

If the appeal proceeds to trial following an arbitration award or finding under this subsection, either party may introduce the award or finding into evidence.  In addition, the court shall award the property owner reasonable attorney fees if the trial was not requested by the property owner and the determination of the appeal results in an appraised value for the owner's property that is equal to or less than the appraised value under the arbitration award or finding.  However, the amount of an award of attorney fees under this subsection is subject to the same limitations as those provided by Section [42.29](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=42.29).

(a)  A property owner or appraisal district that is a party to an appeal under this chapter may request that the parties engage in settlement discussions, including through an informal settlement conference or a form of alternative dispute resolution.  The request must be in writing and delivered to the other party before the date of trial.  The court on motion of either party shall enter orders necessary to implement this section, including an order:
    
    (1)  specifying the form that the settlement discussions must take; or
    
    (2)  changing a deadline to designate experts prescribed by Subsection (c).
    
    (b)  On or before the 120th day after the date the written request is delivered under Subsection (a), each party or the party's attorney of record shall attend the settlement discussions and make a good faith effort to resolve the matter under appeal. 
    
    (c)  If the appraisal district is unable for any reason to attend the settlement discussions on or before the 120th day after the date the written request is delivered under Subsection (a), the deadline to designate experts for the appeal is, notwithstanding a deadline prescribed by the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure:
    
    (1)  with regard to all experts testifying for a party seeking affirmative relief, 60 days before the date of trial; and
    
    (2)  with regard to all other experts, 30 days before the date of trial.

    Sec. 42.23.  SCOPE OF REVIEW.  (a)  Review is by trial de novo.  The district court shall try all issues of fact and law raised by the pleadings in the manner applicable to civil suits generally.
    
    (b)  The court may not admit in evidence the fact of prior action by the appraisal review board or comptroller, except to the extent necessary to establish its jurisdiction.
    
    (c)  Any party is entitled to trial by jury on demand.
    
    (d)  Each party to an appeal is considered a party seeking affirmative relief for the purpose of discovery regarding expert witnesses under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure if, on or before the 120th day after the date the appeal is filed, the property owner:
    
    (1)  makes a written offer of settlement;
    
    (2)  requests alternative dispute resolution; and
    
    (3)  designates, in response to an appropriate written discovery request, which cause of action under this chapter is the basis for the appeal.
    
    (e)  For purposes of Subsection (d), a property owner may designate a cause of action under Section [42.25](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=42.25) or [42.26](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=42.26) as the basis for an appeal, but may not designate a cause of action under both sections as the basis for the appeal.  Discovery regarding a cause of action that is not specifically designated by the property owner under Subsection (d) shall be conducted as provided by the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. A court may not enter an order, including a protective order under Rule 192.6 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, that conflicts with Subsection (d).
    
    (f)  For purposes of a no-evidence motion for summary judgment filed by a party to an appeal under this chapter, the offer of evidence, including an affidavit or testimony, by any person, including the appraisal district, the property owner, or the owner's agent, that was presented at the hearing on the protest before the appraisal review board constitutes sufficient evidence to deny the motion.
    
    (g)  For the sole purpose of admitting expert testimony to determine the value of chemical processing property or utility property in an appeal brought under this chapter and for no other purpose under this title, including the rendition of property under Chapter [22](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=22), the property is considered to be personal property.
    
    (h)  Evidence, argument, or other testimony offered at an appraisal review board hearing by a property owner or agent is not admissible in an appeal under this chapter unless:
    
    (1)  the evidence, argument, or other testimony is offered to demonstrate that there is sufficient evidence to deny a no-evidence motion for summary judgment filed by a party to the appeal or is necessary for the determination of the merits of a motion for summary judgment filed on another ground;
    
    (2)  the property owner or agent is designated as a witness for purposes of trial and the testimony offered at the appraisal review board hearing is offered for impeachment purposes; or
    
    (3)  the evidence is the plaintiff's testimony at the appraisal review board hearing as to the value of the property.
    
    (i)  This subsection applies only to an appeal under this chapter of an order of an appraisal review board determining a protest under Subchapter [C](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41.41), Chapter [41](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41), or a motion under Section [25.25](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=25.25), involving an increase in the appraised value of property under the circumstances described by Section [23.01](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=23.01)(e) or [41.43](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41.43)(a-3).  The appraisal district has the burden of establishing the appraised value of the property subject to the appeal by clear and convincing evidence if the appraised value of the property for the preceding tax year was determined under this chapter at a trial on the merits.

    Sec. 42.231.  JURISDICTION OF DISTRICT COURT; REMAND OF CERTAIN APPEALS.  (a)  This section applies only to an appeal by a property owner of an order of the appraisal review board determining:
    
    (1)  a protest by the property owner as provided by Subchapter [C](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41.41), Chapter [41](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41); or
    
    (2)  a motion filed by the property owner under Section [25.25](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=25.25).
    
    (b)  Subject to the provisions of this section and notwithstanding any other law, if a plea to the jurisdiction is filed in the appeal on the basis that the property owner failed to exhaust the property owner's administrative remedies, the court may, in lieu of dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, remand the action to the appraisal review board with instructions to allow the property owner an opportunity to cure the property owner's failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
    
    (c)  An action remanded to the appraisal review board under Subsection (b) is considered to be a timely filed protest under Subchapter [C](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41.41), Chapter [41](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41), or motion under Section [25.25](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=25.25), as applicable.  The appraisal review board shall schedule a hearing on the protest or motion and issue a written decision determining the protest or motion in the manner required by Subchapter [C](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41.41), Chapter [41](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41), or Section [25.25](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=25.25), as applicable.
    
    (d)  A determination of the appraisal review board relating to the remanded action may be appealed to the court that remanded the action to the board.  A determination appealed to the court under this subsection may not be the subject of a plea to the jurisdiction on the basis of the property owner's failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
    
    (e)  Notwithstanding Subsection (b), on agreement of each party to the appeal and with the approval of the court, the parties to the appeal may waive remand of the action to the appraisal review board and elect that the court determine the appeal on the merits.  If the parties waive remand of the action under this subsection, each party is considered to have exhausted the party's administrative remedies.

    Sec. 42.26.  REMEDY FOR UNEQUAL APPRAISAL.  (a)  The district court shall grant relief on the ground that a property is appraised unequally if:
    
    (1)  the appraisal ratio of the property exceeds by at least 10 percent the median level of appraisal of a reasonable and representative sample of other properties in the appraisal district;
    
    (2)  the appraisal ratio of the property exceeds by at least 10 percent the median level of appraisal of a sample of properties in the appraisal district consisting of a reasonable number of other properties similarly situated to, or of the same general kind or character as, the property subject to the appeal;  or
    
    (3)  the appraised value of the property exceeds the median appraised value of a reasonable number of comparable properties appropriately adjusted.
    
    (b)  If a property owner is entitled to relief under Subsection (a)(1), the court shall order the property's appraised value changed to the value as calculated on the basis of the median level of appraisal according to Subsection (a)(1).  If a property owner is entitled to relief under Subsection (a)(2), the court shall order the property's appraised value changed to the value calculated on the basis of the median level of appraisal according to Subsection (a)(2).  If a property owner is entitled to relief under Subsection (a)(3), the court shall order the property's appraised value changed to the value calculated on the basis of the median appraised value according to Subsection (a)(3).  If a property owner is entitled to relief under more than one subdivision of Subsection (a), the court shall order the property's appraised value changed to the value that results in the lowest appraised value.  The court shall determine each applicable median level of appraisal or median appraised value according to law, and is not required to adopt the median level of appraisal or median appraised value proposed by a party to the appeal.  The court may not limit or deny relief to the property owner entitled to relief under a subdivision of Subsection (a) because the appraised value determined according to another subdivision of Subsection (a) results in a higher appraised value.
    
    (c)  For purposes of establishing the median level of appraisal under Subsection (a)(1), the median level of appraisal in the appraisal district as determined by the comptroller under Section [5.10](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=5.10) is admissible as evidence of the median level of appraisal of a reasonable and representative sample of properties in the appraisal district for the year of the comptroller's determination, subject to the Texas Rules of Evidence and the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.
