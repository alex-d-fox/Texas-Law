If the zone is located in more than one senate or house district, this subsection applies only to the senator or representative in whose district a larger portion of the zone is located than any other senate or house district, as applicable. If fewer than seven taxing units, other than the municipality or county that designated the zone, are eligible to appoint members of the board of directors of the zone, the municipality or county may appoint a number of members of the board such that the board comprises nine members.

In determining the number of members a taxing unit may appoint to the board, the taxing unit's percentage of anticipated pro rata contributions to the tax increment fund is multiplied by the number of members of the board, and a number containing a fraction that is one-half or greater shall be rounded up to the next whole number.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, each taxing unit that approves the payment of all or part of its tax increment into the tax increment fund is entitled to appoint at least one member of the board, and the municipality that designated the zone is entitled to appoint at least as many members of the board as any other participating taxing unit.

Each taxing unit that approves the payment of all or part of its tax increment into the tax increment fund is entitled to appoint a number of members to the board in proportion to the taxing unit's pro rata share of the total anticipated tax increment to be deposited into the tax increment fund during the term of the zone.  In determining the number of members a taxing unit may appoint to the board, the taxing unit's percentage of anticipated pro rata contributions to the tax increment fund is multiplied by nine, and a number containing a fraction that is one-half or greater shall be rounded up to the next whole number.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, each taxing unit that approves the payment of all or part of its tax increment into the tax increment fund is entitled to appoint at least one member of the board, and the municipality that designated the zone is entitled to appoint at least as many members of the board as any other participating taxing unit.

    (h)  A member of the board of directors of a reinvestment zone:
    
    (1)  is not a public official by virtue of that position;  and
    
    (2)  unless otherwise ineligible, may be appointed to serve concurrently on the board of directors of a local government corporation created under Subchapter [D](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=431.101), Chapter [431](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=431), Transportation Code.

    (b)  The board of directors of a reinvestment zone and the governing body of the municipality or county that creates a reinvestment zone may each enter into agreements as the board or the governing body considers necessary or convenient to implement the project plan and reinvestment zone financing plan and achieve their purposes.  An agreement may provide for the regulation or restriction of the use of land by imposing conditions, restrictions, or covenants that run with the land.  An agreement may during the term of the agreement dedicate, pledge, or otherwise provide for the use of revenue in the tax increment fund to pay any project costs that benefit the reinvestment zone, including project costs relating to the cost of buildings, schools, or other educational facilities owned by or on behalf of a school district, community college district, or other political subdivision of this state, railroad or transit facilities, affordable housing, the remediation of conditions that contaminate public or private land or buildings, the preservation of the facade of a private or public building, the demolition of public or private buildings, or the construction of a road, sidewalk, or other public infrastructure in or out of the zone, including the cost of acquiring the real property necessary for the construction of the road, sidewalk, or other public infrastructure.  An agreement may dedicate revenue from the tax increment fund to pay the costs of providing affordable housing or areas of public assembly in or out of the zone.

The board may provide that a restriction adopted by the board continues in effect after the termination of the zone.  In that event, after termination of the zone the restriction is treated as if it had been adopted by the governing body of the municipality.
    
    (d)  The board of directors of a reinvestment zone may exercise any power granted to a municipality or county by Section [311.008](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=311.008), except that:
    
    (1)  the municipality or county that created the reinvestment zone by ordinance, resolution, or order may restrict any power granted to the board by this chapter; and
    
    (2)  the board may exercise a power granted to a municipality or county under Section [311.008](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=311.008)(b)(2) only with the consent of the governing body of the municipality or county.
    
    (e)  After the governing body of a municipality by ordinance or the governing body of a county by order creates a reinvestment zone under this chapter, the board of directors of the zone may exercise any power granted to a board under this chapter.

In this subsection, "local government corporation" means a local government corporation created by the municipality or county under Chapter [431](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=431), Transportation Code.
    
    (g)  Chapter [252](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=252), Local Government Code, does not apply to a dedication, pledge, or other use of revenue in the tax increment fund for a reinvestment zone under Subsection (b).
    
    (h)  Subject to the approval of the governing body of the municipality or county that designated the zone, the board of directors of a reinvestment zone, as necessary or convenient to implement the project plan and reinvestment zone financing plan and achieve their purposes, may establish and provide for the administration of one or more programs for the public purposes of developing and diversifying the economy of the zone, eliminating unemployment and underemployment in the zone, and developing or expanding transportation, business, and commercial activity in the zone, including programs to make grants and loans from the tax increment fund of the zone in an aggregate amount not to exceed the amount of the tax increment produced by the municipality and paid into the tax increment fund for the zone for activities that benefit the zone and stimulate business and commercial activity in the zone. For purposes of this subsection, on approval of the municipality or county, the board of directors of the zone has all the powers of a municipality under Chapter [380](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=380), Local Government Code.

    Sec. 311.0101.  PARTICIPATION OF DISADVANTAGED BUSINESSES IN CERTAIN ZONES.  (a)  It is the goal of the legislature, subject to the constitutional requirements spelled out by the United States Supreme Court in J. A. Croson Company v. City of Richmond (822 F.2d 1355) and as hereafter further elaborated by federal and state courts, that all disadvantaged businesses in the zone designated under Section [311.005](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=311.005)(a)(4) be given full and complete access to the procurement process whereby supplies, materials, services, and equipment are acquired by the board.  It is also the intent of the legislature that to the extent constitutionally permissible, a preference be given to disadvantaged businesses.  The board and general contractor shall give preference, among bids or other proposals that are otherwise comparable, to a bid or other proposal by a disadvantaged business having its home office located in this state.
    
    (b)  It is the intent of the legislature that the zone shall:
    
    (1)  implement a program or programs targeted to disadvantaged businesses in order to inform them fully about the zone procurement process and the requirements for their participation in that process;
    
    (2)  implement such steps as are necessary to ensure that all disadvantaged businesses are made fully aware of opportunities in the zone, including but not limited to specific opportunities to submit bids and proposals.  Steps that may be appropriate in certain circumstances include mailing requests for proposals or notices inviting bids to all disadvantaged businesses in the county;
    
    (3)  require prime contractors, as part of their responses to requests for proposals or bids, to make a specific showing of how they intend to maximize participation by disadvantaged businesses as subcontractors.  The zone shall be required to evaluate such actions by prime contractors as a factor in the award of contracts within the zone procurement process;
    
    (4)  identify disadvantaged businesses in the county that provide or have the potential to provide supplies, materials, services, and equipment to the zone;  and
    
    (5)  identify barriers to participation by disadvantaged businesses in the zone procurement process, such as bonding, insurance, and working capital requirements that may be imposed on businesses.
    
    (c)  It is the intent of the legislature that the zone shall be required to develop a program pursuant to this Act for the purchase of supplies, materials, services, and equipment and that the board of the zone compile a report on an annual basis listing the total number and dollar amount of contracts awarded to disadvantaged businesses during the previous year as well as the total number and dollar amount of all contracts awarded.  Such annual report shall be available for inspection by the general public during regular business hours.
    
    (d)  The board by rule shall adopt goals for the participation of minority business enterprises and women-owned business enterprises in the awarding of state contracts for professional services.  To implement the participation goals, the board shall encourage each issuer to award to minority business enterprises and women-owned business enterprises not less than 15 percent of the total value of all professional services contract awards that the issuer expects to make in its fiscal year.

    Sec. 311.011.  PROJECT AND FINANCING PLANS.  (a)  The board of directors of a reinvestment zone shall prepare and adopt a project plan and a reinvestment zone financing plan for the zone and submit the plans to the governing body of the municipality or county that designated the zone.
    
    (b)  The project plan must include:
    
    (1)  a description and map showing existing uses and conditions of real property in the zone and proposed uses of that property;
    
    (2)  proposed changes of zoning ordinances, the master plan of the municipality, building codes, other municipal ordinances, and subdivision rules and regulations, if any, of the county, if applicable;
    
    (3)  a list of estimated nonproject costs; and
    
    (4)  a statement of a method of relocating persons to be displaced, if any, as a result of implementing the plan.
    
    (c)  The reinvestment zone financing plan must include:
    
    (1)  a detailed list describing the estimated project costs of the zone, including administrative expenses;
    
    (2)  a statement listing the proposed kind, number, and location of all public works or public improvements to be financed by the zone;
    
    (3)  a finding that the plan is economically feasible and an economic feasibility study;
    
    (4)  the estimated amount of bonded indebtedness to be incurred;
    
    (5)  the estimated time when related costs or monetary obligations are to be incurred;
    
    (6)  a description of the methods of financing all estimated project costs and the expected sources of revenue to finance or pay project costs, including the percentage of tax increment to be derived from the property taxes of each taxing unit anticipated to contribute tax increment to the zone that levies taxes on real property in the zone;
    
    (7)  the current total appraised value of taxable real property in the zone;
    
    (8)  the estimated captured appraised value of the zone during each year of its existence; and
    
    (9)  the duration of the zone.
    
    (d)  The governing body of the municipality or county that designated the zone must approve a project plan or reinvestment zone financing plan after its adoption by the board. The approval must be by ordinance, in the case of a municipality, or by order, in the case of a county, that finds that the plan is feasible.
    
    (e)  The board of directors of the zone at any time may adopt an amendment to the project plan consistent with the requirements and limitations of this chapter.  The amendment takes effect on approval by the governing body of the municipality or county that created the zone.  That approval must be by ordinance, in the case of a municipality, or by order, in the case of a county.  If an amendment reduces or increases the geographic area of the zone, increases the amount of bonded indebtedness to be incurred, increases or decreases the percentage of a tax increment to be contributed by a taxing unit, increases the total estimated project costs, or designates additional property in the zone to be acquired by the municipality or county, the approval must be by ordinance or order, as applicable, adopted after a public hearing that satisfies the procedural requirements of Sections [311.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=311.003)(c) and (d).
    
    (f)  In a zone designated under Section [311.005](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=311.005)(a)(4) that is located in a county with a population of 3.3 million or more, the project plan must provide that at least one-third of the tax increment of the zone be used to provide affordable housing during the term of the zone.
    
    (g)  A school district that participates in a zone is not required to increase the percentage or amount of the tax increment to be contributed by the school district because of an amendment to the project plan or reinvestment zone financing plan for the zone unless the governing body of the school district by official action approves the amendment.
    
    (h)  Unless specifically provided otherwise in the plan, all amounts contained in the project plan or reinvestment zone financing plan, including amounts of expenditures relating to project costs and amounts relating to participation by taxing units, are considered estimates and do not act as a limitation on the described items, but the amounts contained in the project plan or reinvestment zone financing plan may not vary materially from the estimates.  This subsection may not be construed to increase the amount of any reduction under Section [403.302](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=403.302)(d)(4), Government Code, in the total taxable value of the property in a school district that participates in the zone as computed under Section [403.302](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=403.302)(d) of that code.

    Sec. 311.012.  DETERMINATION OF AMOUNT OF TAX INCREMENT.  (a)  The amount of a taxing unit's tax increment for a year is the amount of property taxes levied and assessed by the unit for that year on the captured appraised value of real property taxable by the unit and located in a reinvestment zone or the amount of property taxes levied and collected by the unit for that year on the captured appraised value of real property taxable by the unit and located in a reinvestment zone.  The governing body of a taxing unit shall determine which of the methods specified by this subsection is used to calculate the amount of the unit's tax increment.
    
    (b)  The captured appraised value of real property taxable by a taxing unit for a year is the total taxable value of all real property taxable by the unit and located in a reinvestment zone for that year less the tax increment base of the unit.
    
    (c)  The tax increment base of a taxing unit is the total taxable value of all real property taxable by the unit and located in a reinvestment zone for the year in which the zone was designated under this chapter. If the boundaries of a zone are enlarged, the tax increment base is increased by the taxable value of the real property added to the zone for the year in which the property was added. If the boundaries of a zone are reduced, the tax increment base is reduced by the taxable value of the real property removed from the zone for the year in which the property was originally included in the zone's boundaries. If the municipality that designates a zone does not levy an ad valorem tax in the year in which the zone is designated, the tax increment base is determined by the appraisal district in which the zone is located using assumptions regarding exemptions and other relevant information provided to the appraisal district by the municipality.

    Sec. 311.0123.  SALES TAX INCREMENT.  (a)  In this section, "sales tax base" for a reinvestment zone means the amount of municipal sales and use taxes attributable to the zone for the year in which the zone was designated under this chapter.
    
    (b)  The governing body of a municipality may determine, in an ordinance designating an area as a reinvestment zone or in an ordinance adopted subsequent to the designation of a zone, the portion or amount of tax increment generated from municipal sales and use taxes attributable to the zone, above the sales tax base, to be deposited into the tax increment fund.  Nothing in this section requires a municipality to contribute sales tax increment into a tax increment fund.
    
    (c)  Before the issuance of a bond, note, or other obligation under this chapter that pledges the payments into the tax increment fund under Subsection (b), the governing body of a municipality may enter into an agreement, under Subchapter [E](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=271.091), Chapter [271](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=271), Local Government Code, to authorize and direct the comptroller to:

    (e)  The sales and use taxes to be deposited into the tax increment fund under this section may be disbursed from the fund only to:
    
    (1)  satisfy claims of holders of tax increment bonds, notes, or other obligations issued or incurred for the reinvestment zone;
    
    (2)  pay project costs for the zone; and
    
    (3)  make payments in accordance with an agreement made under Section [311.010](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=311.010)(b) dedicating revenue from the tax increment fund.

    Sec. 311.0125.  TAX ABATEMENT AGREEMENTS.  (a)  Notwithstanding any provision in this chapter to the contrary, a taxing unit other than a school district may enter into a tax abatement agreement with an owner of real or personal property in a reinvestment zone, regardless of whether the taxing unit deposits or agrees to deposit any portion of its tax increment into the tax increment fund.
    
    (b)  To be effective, an agreement to abate taxes on real property in a reinvestment zone must be approved by:
    
    (1)  the board of directors of the reinvestment zone;  and
    
    (2)  the governing body of each taxing unit that imposes taxes on real property in the reinvestment zone and deposits or agrees to deposit any of its tax increment into the tax increment fund for the zone.
    
    (c)  In any contract entered into by the board of directors of a reinvestment zone in connection with bonds or other obligations, the board may convenant  that the board will not approve a tax abatement agreement that applies to real property in that zone.
    
    (d)  If a taxing unit enters into a tax abatement agreement authorized by this section, taxes that are abated under that agreement are not considered taxes to be imposed or produced by that taxing unit in calculating the amount of:
    
    (1)  the tax increment of that taxing unit;  or
    
    (2)  that taxing unit's deposit to the tax increment fund for the reinvestment zone.
    
    (e)  The Texas Department of Economic Development or its successor may recommend that a taxing unit enter into a tax abatement agreement with a person under this chapter.  In determining whether to approve an agreement to abate taxes on real property in a reinvestment zone under Subsection (b), the board of directors of the reinvestment zone and the governing body of a taxing unit shall consider any recommendation made by the Texas Department of Economic Development or its successor.

    Sec. 311.013.  COLLECTION AND DEPOSIT OF TAX INCREMENTS.  (a)  Each taxing unit that taxes real property located in a reinvestment zone shall provide for the collection of its taxes in the zone as for any other property taxed by the unit.
    
    (b)  Each taxing unit shall pay into the tax increment fund for the zone an amount equal to the tax increment produced by the unit, less the sum of:
    
    (1)  property taxes produced from the tax increments that are, by contract executed before the designation of the area as a reinvestment zone, required to be paid by the unit to another political subdivision; and
    
    (2)  for a taxing unit other than the municipality that created the zone, a portion, not to exceed 15 percent, of the tax increment produced by the unit as provided by the reinvestment zone financing plan or a larger portion as provided by Subsection (f).
    
    (c)  Notwithstanding any termination of the reinvestment zone under Section [311.017](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=311.017)(a) and unless otherwise specified by an agreement between the taxing unit and the municipality or county that created the zone, a taxing unit shall make a payment required by Subsection (b) not later than the 90th day after the later of:
    
    (1)  the delinquency date for the unit's property taxes; or
    
    (2)  the date the municipality or county that created the zone submits to the taxing unit an invoice specifying the tax increment produced by the taxing unit and the amount the taxing unit is required to pay into the tax increment fund for the zone.
    
    (c-1)  A delinquent payment incurs a penalty of five percent of the amount delinquent and accrues interest at an annual rate of 10 percent.

    (f)  A taxing unit is not required to pay into the tax increment fund any of its tax increment produced from property located in a reinvestment zone designated under Section [311.005](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=311.005)(a) or in an area added to a reinvestment zone under Section [311.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=311.007) unless the taxing unit enters into an agreement to do so with the governing body of the municipality or county that designated the zone. A taxing unit may enter into an agreement under this subsection at any time before or after the zone is designated or enlarged. The agreement may include conditions for payment of that tax increment into the fund and must specify the portion of the tax increment to be paid into the fund and the years for which that tax increment is to be paid into the fund. In addition to any other terms to which the parties may agree, the agreement may specify the projects to which a participating taxing unit's tax increment will be dedicated and that the taxing unit's participation may be computed with respect to a base year later than the original base year of the zone. The agreement and the conditions in the agreement are binding on the taxing unit, the municipality or county, and the board of directors of the zone.
    
    (f-1)  This subsection does not apply to a hospital district to which Section [281.095](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=281.095), Health and Safety Code, applies.  Notwithstanding Subsection (f), the commissioners court of a county that enters into an agreement with the governing body of a municipality under Subsection (f) may enter into an agreement with the governing body of the municipality under that subsection on behalf of a taxing unit other than the county if by statute the ad valorem tax rate of the other taxing unit is approved by the commissioners court or the commissioners court is expressly required by statute to levy the ad valorem taxes of the other taxing unit.  The agreement entered into on behalf of the other taxing unit is not required to contain the same conditions as the agreement entered into on behalf of the county.  This subsection does not authorize the commissioners court of a county to enter into an agreement on behalf of another taxing unit solely because the county tax assessor-collector is required by law to assess or collect the taxing unit's ad valorem taxes.
    
    (f-2)  This subsection does not apply to a hospital district to which Section [281.095](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=281.095), Health and Safety Code, applies.  Notwithstanding Subsection (f), the commissioners court of a county that creates a zone may provide by order for the payment into the tax increment fund for the zone of a portion of the tax increment produced by a taxing unit other than the county if by statute the ad valorem tax rate of the other taxing unit is approved by the commissioners court or the commissioners court is expressly required by statute to levy the ad valorem taxes of the other taxing unit.  The order may include conditions for payment of that tax increment into the fund that are different from the conditions applicable to the county's obligation to pay into the fund the tax increment produced by the county.  This subsection does not authorize the commissioners court of a county to provide for the payment into the fund of a portion of the tax increment produced by another taxing unit solely because the county tax assessor-collector is required by law to assess or collect the taxing unit's ad valorem taxes.
    
    (g)  Subject to the provisions of Section [311.0125](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=311.0125), in lieu of permitting a portion of its tax increment to be paid into the tax increment fund, and notwithstanding the provisions of Section [312.203](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=312.203), a taxing unit, including a municipality, may elect to offer the owners of taxable real property in a reinvestment zone created under this chapter an exemption from taxation of all or part of the value of the property.  To be effective, an agreement to exempt real property from ad valorem taxes under this subsection must be approved by:
    
    (1)  the board of directors of the reinvestment zone; and
    
    (2)  the governing body of each taxing unit that imposes taxes on real property in the reinvestment zone and deposits or agrees to deposit any of its tax increment into the tax increment fund for the zone.
    
    (h)  Repealed by Acts 2003, 78th Leg., ch. 8, Sec. 1, eff. April 24, 2003.
    
    (i)  Notwithstanding Subsection (c) and Section [311.012](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=311.012)(a), a taxing unit is not required to pay into a tax increment fund the applicable portion of a tax increment attributable to delinquent taxes until those taxes are collected.
    
    (j)  Section [26.05](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.05)(f) does not prohibit a taxing unit from depositing all of the tax increment produced by the taxing unit in a reinvestment zone into the tax increment fund for that zone.
    
    (k)  A school district is not required to pay into the tax increment fund any of its tax increment produced from property located in an area added to the reinvestment zone under Section [311.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=311.007)(a) or (b) unless the governing body of the school district enters into an agreement to do so with the governing body of the municipality or county that created the zone.  The governing body of a school district may enter into an agreement under this subsection at any time before or after the zone is created or enlarged.  The agreement may include conditions for payment of that tax increment into the fund and must specify the portion of the tax increment to be paid into the fund and the years for which that tax increment is to be paid into the fund.  The agreement and the conditions in the agreement are binding on the school district, the municipality or county, and the board of directors of the zone.
    
    (l)  The governing body of a municipality or county that designates an area as a reinvestment zone may determine, in the designating ordinance or order adopted under Section [311.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=311.003) or in the ordinance or order adopted under Section [311.011](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=311.011) approving the reinvestment zone financing plan for the zone, the portion of the tax increment produced by the municipality or county that the municipality or county is required to pay into the tax increment fund for the zone. If a municipality or county does not determine the portion of the tax increment produced by the municipality or county that the municipality or county is required to pay into the tax increment fund for a reinvestment zone, the municipality or county is required to pay into the fund for the zone the entire tax increment produced by the municipality or county, except as provided by Subsection (b)(1).
    
    (m)  The governing body of a municipality that is located in a county with a population of more than 2.1 million but less than 2.5 million or in a county with a population of 3.3 million or more by ordinance may reduce the portion of the tax increment produced by the municipality that the municipality is required to pay into the tax increment fund for the zone.  The municipality may not reduce under this subsection the portion of the tax increment produced by the municipality that the municipality is required to pay into the tax increment fund for the zone unless the municipality provides each county that has entered into an agreement with the municipality to pay all or a portion of the county's tax increment into the fund an opportunity to enter into an agreement with the municipality to reduce the portion of the tax increment produced by the county that the county is required to pay into the tax increment fund for the zone by the same proportion that the portion of the municipality's tax increment that the municipality is required to pay into the fund is reduced.  The portion of the tax increment produced by a municipality that the municipality is required to pay into the tax increment fund for a reinvestment zone, as reduced by the ordinance adopted under this subsection, together with all other revenues required to be paid into the fund, must be sufficient to complete and pay for the estimated costs of projects listed in the reinvestment zone financing plan and pay any tax increment bonds or notes issued for the zone, and any other obligations of the zone.
    
    (n)  This subsection applies only to a school district whose taxable value computed under Section [403.302](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=403.302)(d), Government Code, is reduced in accordance with Subdivision (4) of that subsection.  In addition to the amount otherwise required to be paid into the tax increment fund, the district shall pay into the fund an amount equal to the amount by which the amount of taxes the district would have been required to pay into the fund in the current year if the district levied taxes at the rate the district levied in 2005 exceeds the amount the district is otherwise required to pay into the fund in the year of the reduction.  This additional amount may not exceed the amount the school district receives in state aid for the current tax year under Section [48.253](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.253), Education Code.  The school district shall pay the additional amount after the district receives the state aid to which the district is entitled for the current tax year under Section [48.253](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.253), Education Code.

    Sec. 311.014.  TAX INCREMENT FUND.  (a)  In addition to the deposits required by Section [311.013](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=311.013), all revenues from the sale of tax increment bonds or notes, revenues from the sale of any property acquired as part of the tax increment financing plan, and other revenues to be used in the reinvestment zone shall be deposited in the tax increment fund for the zone.
    
    (b)  Money may be disbursed from the fund only to satisfy claims of holders of tax increment bonds or notes issued for the zone, to pay project costs for the zone, to make payments pursuant to an agreement made under Section [311.010](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=311.010)(b) dedicating revenue from the tax increment fund, or to repay other obligations incurred for the zone.
    
    (c)  Subject to an agreement with the holders of tax increment bonds or notes, money in a tax increment fund may be temporarily invested in the same manner as other funds of the municipality or county that created the zone.
    
    (d)  After all project costs, all tax increment bonds or notes issued for a reinvestment zone, and any other obligations incurred for the zone have been paid, and subject to any agreement with bondholders, any money remaining in the tax increment fund shall be paid to the municipality or county that created the zone and other taxing units levying taxes on property in the zone in proportion to the municipality's or county's and each other unit's respective share of the total amount of tax increments derived from taxable real property in the zone that were deposited in the fund during the fund's existence.
    
    (e)  A taxing unit that levies taxes on real property in a reinvestment zone may make a loan to the board of directors of the zone for deposit in the tax increment fund for the zone if the governing body of the taxing unit determines that the loan is beneficial to, and serves a public purpose of, the taxing unit.  The loan is payable on the terms agreed to by the taxing unit, or an instrumentality of the taxing unit if applicable, and the board of directors of the zone.  A loan under this subsection:
    
    (1)  is not considered to be a tax increment bond or note under Section [311.015](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=311.015); and
    
    (2)  is considered to be:
    
    (A)  an authorized investment under Chapter [2256](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2256), Government Code; and
    
    (B)  an obligation incurred for the zone.
    
    (f)  Money in the tax increment fund for a reinvestment zone may be transferred to the tax increment fund for an adjacent zone if:
    
    (1)  the taxing units that participate in the zone from which the money is to be transferred participate in the adjacent zone and vice versa;
    
    (2)  each participating taxing unit has agreed to deposit the same portion of its tax increment in the fund for each zone;
    
    (3)  each participating taxing unit has agreed to the transfer; and
    
    (4)  the holders of any tax increment bonds or notes issued for the zone from which the money is to be transferred have agreed to the transfer.

    Sec. 311.015.  TAX INCREMENT BONDS AND NOTES.  (a)  A municipality designating a reinvestment zone may issue tax increment bonds or notes, the proceeds of which may be used to make payments pursuant to agreements made under Section [311.010](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=311.010)(b), to pay project costs for the reinvestment zone on behalf of which the bonds or notes were issued, or to satisfy claims of holders of the bonds or notes. The municipality may issue refunding bonds or notes for the payment or retirement of tax increment bonds or notes previously issued by it.
    
    (b)  Tax increment bonds and notes are payable, as to both principal and interest, solely from the tax increment fund established for the reinvestment zone.  The governing body of the municipality may pledge irrevocably all or part of the fund for payment of tax increment bonds or notes.  The part of the fund pledged in payment may be used only for the payment of the bonds or notes or interest on the bonds or notes until the bonds or notes have been fully paid.  A holder of the bonds or notes or of coupons issued on the bonds has a lien against the fund for payment of the bonds or notes and interest on the bonds or notes and may protect or enforce the lien at law or in equity.
    
    (c)  Tax increment bonds are issued by ordinance of the municipality without any additional approval other than that of the attorney general.
    
    (d)  Tax increment bonds or notes, together with the interest on and income from those bonds or notes, are exempt from all taxes.
    
    (e)  The issuing municipality may provide in the contract with the owners or holders of tax increment bonds that it will pay into the tax increment fund all or any part of the revenue produced or received from the operation or sale of a facility acquired, improved, or constructed pursuant to a project plan, to be used to pay principal and interest on the bonds.  If the municipality agrees, the owners or holders of tax increment bonds may have a lien or mortgage on a facility acquired, improved, or constructed with the proceeds of the bonds.
    
    (f)  Tax increment bonds may be issued in one or more series.  The ordinance approving a tax increment bond or note, or the trust indenture or mortgage issued in connection with the bond or note, shall provide:
    
    (1)  the date that the bond or note bears;
    
    (2)  that the bond or note is payable on demand or at a specified time;
    
    (3)  the interest rate that the bond or note bears;
    
    (4)  the denomination of the bond or note;
    
    (5)  whether the bond or note is in coupon or registered form;
    
    (6)  the conversion or registration privileges of the bond or note;
    
    (7)  the rank or priority of the bond or note;
    
    (8)  the manner of execution of the bond or note;
    
    (9)  the medium of payment in which and the place or places at which the bond or note is payable;
    
    (10)  the terms of redemption, with or without premium, to which the bond or note is subject;
    
    (11)  the manner in which the bond or note is secured;  and
    
    (12)  any other characteristic of the bond or note.
    
    (g)  A bond or note issued under this chapter is fully negotiable.  In a suit, action, or other proceeding involving the validity or enforceability of a bond or note issued under this chapter or the security of a bond or note issued under this chapter, if the bond or note recites in substance that it was issued by the municipality for a reinvestment zone, the bond or note is conclusively deemed to have been issued for that purpose, and the development or redevelopment of the zone is conclusively deemed to have been planned, located, and carried out as provided by this chapter.
    
    (h)  A bank, trust company, savings bank or institution, savings and loan association, investment company or other person carrying on a banking or investment business;  an insurance company, insurance association, or other person carrying on an insurance business;  or an executor, administrator, curator, trustee, or other fiduciary may invest any sinking funds, money, or other funds belonging to it or in its control in tax increment bonds or notes issued under this chapter.  Tax increment bonds or notes are authorized security for all public deposits.  A person, political subdivision, or public or private officer may use funds owned or controlled by the person, political subdivision, or officer to purchase tax increment bonds or notes.  This chapter does not relieve any person of the duty to exercise reasonable care in selecting securities.
    
    (i)  A tax increment bond or note is not a general obligation of the municipality issuing the bond or note.  A tax increment bond or note does not give rise to a charge against the general credit or taxing powers of the municipality and is not payable except as provided by this chapter.  A tax increment bond or note issued under this chapter must state the restrictions of this subsection on its face.
    
    (i-1)  A municipality's obligation to deposit sales and use taxes into the tax increment fund is not a general obligation of the municipality.  An obligation to make payments from sales and use taxes under Section [311.0123](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=311.0123) does not give rise to a charge against the general credit or taxing powers of the municipality and is not payable except as provided by this chapter.  A tax increment bond or note issued under this chapter that pledges payments made under Section [311.0123](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=311.0123) must state the restrictions of this subsection on its face.
    
    (j)  A tax increment bond or note may not be included in any computation of the debt of the issuing municipality.
    
    (k)  A municipality may not issue tax increment bonds or notes in an amount that exceeds the total cost of implementing the project plan for the reinvestment zone for which the bonds or notes are issued.
    
    (l)  A tax increment bond or note must mature on or before the date by which the final payments of tax increment into the tax increment fund are due.

    (a-1)  Notwithstanding the designation of a later termination date under Subsection (a), a taxing unit that taxes real property located in the reinvestment zone, other than the municipality or county that created the zone, is not required to pay any of its tax increment into the tax increment fund for the zone after the termination date designated in the ordinance or order creating the zone unless the governing body of the taxing unit enters into an agreement to do so with the governing body of the municipality or county that created the zone.

    (a-1)  This subsection applies only to a reinvestment zone created by a municipality that has a population of more than 256,000 but less than 280,000 and is the county seat of a county that has a population of 325,000 or less.  Notwithstanding Subsection (a)(1), a municipality by ordinance adopted subsequent to the ordinance adopted by the municipality creating a reinvestment zone may designate a termination date for the zone that is later than the termination date designated in the ordinance creating the zone but not later than the 20th anniversary of that date.  If a municipality adopts an ordinance extending the termination date for a reinvestment zone as authorized by this subsection, the zone terminates on the earlier of:
    
    (1)  the termination date designated in the ordinance; or
    
    (2)  the date provided by Subsection (a)(2).
    
    (b)  The tax increment pledged to the payment of bonds and interest on the bonds and to the payment of any other obligations may be discharged and the reinvestment zone may be terminated if the municipality or county that created the zone deposits or causes to be deposited with a trustee or other escrow agent authorized by law funds in an amount that, together with the interest on the investment of the funds in direct obligations of the United States, will be sufficient to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on all bonds issued on behalf of the reinvestment zone at maturity or at the date fixed for redemption of the bonds, and to pay any other amounts that may become due, including compensation due or to become due to the trustee or escrow agent, as well as to pay the principal of and interest on any other obligations incurred on behalf of the zone.
