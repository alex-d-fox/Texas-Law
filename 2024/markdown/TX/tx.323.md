    Sec. 323.101.  TAX AUTHORIZED.  (a)  A qualified county may adopt or repeal the county sales and use tax authorized by this chapter at an election in which a majority of the qualified voters of the county approve the adoption or repeal of the tax, as applicable.
    
    (b)  A county is qualified to adopt the tax only if no part of the county is located in a rapid transit authority created under Chapter [451](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=451), Transportation Code, or a regional transportation authority created under Chapter 452 of that code.

For the purposes of this section, an authority is not considered to be located in any county in which fewer than 250 persons are both residents of the authority and the county.
    
    (d)  A county may not adopt a sales and use tax under this section if as a result of the adoption of the tax the combined rate of all sales and use taxes imposed by the county and other political subdivisions of this state having territory in the county would exceed two percent at any location in the county.
    
    (e)  If the voters of a county approve the adoption of a sales and use tax at an election held on the same election date on which a municipality having territory in the county adopts a sales and use tax or an additional sales and use tax and as a result the combined rate of all sales and use taxes imposed by the county and other political subdivisions of this state having territory in the county would exceed two percent at any location in the county, the election to adopt a county sales and use tax has no effect.
    
    (f)  The provisions of this chapter govern the application, collection, and administration of a sales and use tax imposed under Chapter [285](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=285) or [775](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=775), Health and Safety Code, to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of those chapters.

    Sec. 323.105.  CRIME CONTROL DISTRICT TAX.  (a)  Subject to an election held in accordance with the Crime Control and Prevention District Act, a county in which a crime control and prevention district is established shall adopt a sales and use tax in the area of the district for the purpose of financing the operation of the crime control and prevention district.  The revenue from the tax may be used only for the purpose of financing the operation of the crime control and prevention district.  The proposition for adopting a tax under this section and the proposition for creation of a crime control and prevention district shall be submitted at the same election.  For purposes of Subsection (c) of Section [323.101](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=323.101) of this code, a tax under this section is not a county sales and use tax.
    
    (b)  A tax adopted for a district under this section for financing the operation of the district may be decreased in increments of one-eighth of one percent by order of the board of directors of the district.
    
    (c)  The board of directors or the governing body of the governmental entity that proposed the creation of the crime control and prevention district may call an election on the question of decreasing the tax rate in increments of one-eighth of one percent in the district if the district was created before January 1, 1996.  The board of directors or governing body may dedicate a portion of the tax for the payment of bonds used in conjunction with the renovation or extension of a county-owned or municipally owned convention center facility, as defined in Section [351.001](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=351.001), that was constructed before 1969 if the dedication is approved by a majority of the qualified voters in an election held in the district on the question of decreasing the tax rate.  At the election, the ballot shall be printed to provide for voting for or against the following proposition:  "The decrease of the _______ Crime Control and Prevention District sales and use tax to _____ percent and authorizing the use of ______ of one percent for the payment of bonds issued for the renovation or extension of certain county-owned or municipally owned convention center facilities as that term is defined under Section [351.001](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=351.001), Tax Code, and authorizing that the tax expire on payment of the bonds."
    
    (d)  The rate of a tax adopted for a district under this section may be increased in increments of one-eighth of one percent, not to exceed a total tax rate of one-half percent for financing the operation of the crime control and prevention district, by order of the board of directors of the crime control and prevention district if approved by a majority of the qualified voters voting at an election called by the board and held in the district on the question of increasing the tax rate.  At the election, the ballot shall be printed to provide for voting for or against the following proposition:  "The increase of the ____________ Crime Control and Prevention District sales and use tax rate to ____________ percent."  If there is an increase or decrease under this subsection in the rate of a tax imposed under this section, the new rate takes effect on the first day of the next calendar quarter after the expiration of one calendar quarter after the comptroller receives notice of the increase or decrease.  However, if the comptroller notifies the president of the board of directors of the district in writing within 10 days after receipt of the notification that the comptroller requires more time to implement reporting and collection procedures, the comptroller may delay implementation of the rate change for one whole calendar quarter.  In that event, the new rate takes effect on the first day of the next calendar quarter following the elapsed quarter.
    
    (e)  The comptroller shall remit to the county amounts collected at the rate imposed under this section as part of the regular allocation of county tax revenue collected by the comptroller if the district is composed of the entire county.  The comptroller shall, if the district is composed of an area less than the entire county, remit that amount to the district.  Retailers may not be required to use the allocation and reporting procedures in the collection of taxes under this section different from the procedures that retailers use in the collection of other sales and use taxes under this chapter.  An item, transaction, or service that is taxable in a county under a sales or use tax authorized by another section of this chapter is taxable under this section.  An item, transaction, or service that is not taxable in a county under a sales or use tax authorized by another section of this chapter is not taxable under this section.
    
    (f)  If, in a county where a crime control and prevention district is composed of the whole county, a county sales and use tax or a county sales and use tax rate increase for the purpose of financing a crime control and prevention district is approved, the county is responsible for distributing to the district that portion of the county sales and use tax revenue received from the comptroller that is to be used for the purposes of financing the crime control and prevention district.  Not later than the 10th day after the date the county receives funds under this section from the comptroller, the county shall make the distribution in the proportion that the crime control and prevention portion of the tax rate bears to the total sales and use tax rate of the county.  The amounts distributed to a crime control and prevention district are not considered to be sales and use tax revenue for the purpose of property tax reduction and computation of the county tax rate under Section [26.041](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.041), Tax Code.
    
    (g)  For purposes of the tax imposed under this section, a reference in this chapter to the county as the territory in which the tax or an incident of the tax applies means only the territory located in the crime control and prevention district, if that district is composed of an area less than an entire county.
    
    (h)  The comptroller may adopt rules and the county commissioners court may adopt orders to administer this section.

    (b)  The amount of the total tax is computed by multiplying the combined applicable tax rates by the amount of the sales price.  If the product results in a fraction of a cent less than one-half of one cent, the fraction of a cent is not collected.  If the fraction of a cent is one-half of one cent or more, the fraction shall be collected as one cent.

    (b)  If a sale of a taxable item is consummated in this state but not within a county that has adopted the taxes authorized by this chapter and the taxable item is shipped directly, or brought by the purchaser or lessee directly, into a county that has adopted the taxes authorized by this chapter, the taxable item is subject to the county's use tax.

In this subsection an item is not considered to have been stored, used, or consumed because of a temporary delay or interruption necessary and incidental to its transportation or further fabrication, processing, or assembling within this state for delivery to the permit holder.  A charge for fabrication, processing, or further assembly in a county that has adopted the tax under this chapter shall be subject to the county use tax.
