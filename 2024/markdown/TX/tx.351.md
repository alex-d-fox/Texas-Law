An estimate made under this subsection is prima facie evidence of the amount of tax due for that period in relation to that hotel.

    (b-1)  The limitation provided by Subsection (b) does not apply and a municipality may bring suit under this section at any time if:
    
    (1)  with intent to evade the tax, the person files a false or fraudulent report with the municipality; or
    
    (2)  the person has not filed a report for the tax with the municipality.
    
    (c)  A municipality by ordinance may authorize misdemeanor punishment for a violation of an ordinance adopted under this chapter.

    (f)  Municipal hotel occupancy tax revenue may not be spent for travel for a person to attend an event or conduct an activity the primary purpose of which is not directly related to the promotion of tourism and the convention and hotel industry or the performance of the person's job in an efficient and professional manner.

    (1)  at least annually submit a report of the person's expenditures of funds received from the grantee to the governing body of the municipality; and
    
    (2)  make records of those expenditures available for review to the governing body of the municipality and any other person.
    
    (g-1)  A municipality may not require a person that receives funds directly from the municipality through a grant to conduct an activity authorized by Subsection (a)(4) to waive a right guaranteed by law to the person or to enter into an agreement with another person.
