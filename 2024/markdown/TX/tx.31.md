    (c-2)  For a tax bill that includes back taxes on an improvement that escaped taxation in a prior year, the tax bill or separate statement described by Subsection (c) must state that no interest is due on the back taxes if those back taxes are paid not later than the 120th day after the date the tax bill is sent.
    
    (d)  Each tax bill shall also state the amount of penalty, if any, imposed pursuant to Sections [23.431](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=23.431), [23.54](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=23.54), [23.541](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=23.541), [23.75](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=23.75), [23.751](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=23.751), [23.87](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=23.87), [23.97](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=23.97), and [23.9804](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=23.9804).
    
    (d-1)  This subsection applies only to a school district.  In addition to stating the total tax rate for the school district, the tax bill or the separate statement shall separately state:
    
    (1)  the maintenance and operations rate of the school district;
    
    (2)  if the school district has outstanding debt, as defined by Section [26.012](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.012), the debt rate of the district;
    
    (3)  the maintenance and operations rate of the school district for the preceding tax year;
    
    (4)  if for the current tax year the school district imposed taxes for debt, as defined by Section [26.012](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.012), the debt rate of the district for the current tax year;
    
    (5)  if for the preceding tax year the school district imposed taxes for debt, as defined by Section [26.012](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.012), the debt rate of the district for that year; and
    
    (6)  the total tax rate of the district for the preceding tax year.
    
    (d-2)  This subsection and Subsections (d-3) and (d-4) apply only to taxes imposed by a taxing unit on property for the 2023 tax year and only if the changes in law made by S.B. 2, Acts of the 88th Legislature, 2nd Called Session, 2023, would lower the taxes imposed by the taxing unit on the property for that tax year.  The assessor for the taxing unit shall compute the amount of taxes imposed and the other information required by this section as if the changes in law made by S.B. 2, Acts of the 88th Legislature, 2nd Called Session, 2023, were in effect for that tax year.  The tax bill or the separate statement must indicate that the bill is a provisional tax bill and include a statement in substantially the following form:
    
    "If the Texas Legislature had not enacted property tax relief legislation during the 2023 legislative session, your tax bill would have been $____ (insert amount of tax bill if the changes in law made by S.B. 2, Acts of the 88th Legislature, 2nd Called Session, 2023, were not in effect for that tax year).  Because of action by the Texas Legislature, your tax bill has been lowered by $____ (insert difference between amount of tax bill if the changes in law made by S.B. 2, Acts of the 88th Legislature, 2nd Called Session, 2023, were not in effect for that tax year and amount of tax bill if that Act were in effect for that tax year), resulting in a lower tax bill of $____ (insert amount of tax bill if the changes in law made by S.B. 2, Acts of the 88th Legislature, 2nd Called Session, 2023, were in effect for that tax year), contingent on the approval by the voters at an election to be held November 7, 2023, of the constitutional amendment proposed by H.J.R. 2, 88th Legislature, 2nd Called Session, 2023.  If that constitutional amendment is not approved by the voters at the election, a supplemental tax bill in the amount of $____ (insert difference between amount of tax bill if the changes in law made by S.B. 2, Acts of the 88th Legislature, 2nd Called Session, 2023, were not in effect for that tax year and amount of tax bill if that Act were in effect for that tax year) will be mailed to you."
    
    (d-3)  A tax bill prepared by the assessor for a taxing unit as provided by Subsection (d-2) and mailed as provided by Subsection (a) is considered to be a provisional tax bill until the canvass of the votes on the constitutional amendment proposed by H.J.R. 2, 88th Legislature, 2nd Called Session, 2023.  If the constitutional amendment is approved by the voters, the tax bill is considered to be a final tax bill for the taxes imposed on the property for the 2023 tax year, and no additional tax bill is required to be mailed unless another provision of this title requires the mailing of a corrected tax bill.  If the constitutional amendment is not approved by the voters:
    
    (1)  a tax bill prepared by the assessor as provided by Subsection (d-2) is considered to be a final tax bill but only as to the portion of the taxes imposed on the property for the 2023 tax year that are included in the bill;
    
    (2)  the amount of taxes imposed by each taxing unit on property for the 2023 tax year is calculated as if the changes in law made by S.B. 2, Acts of the 88th Legislature, 2nd Called Session, 2023, were not in effect for that tax year; and
    
    (3)  except as provided by Subsections (f), (i-1), and (k), the assessor for each taxing unit shall prepare and mail a supplemental tax bill, by December 1 or as soon thereafter as practicable, in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of the tax bill if the changes in law made by S.B. 2, Acts of the 88th Legislature, 2nd Called Session, 2023, were not in effect for that tax year and the amount of the tax bill if that Act were in effect for that tax year.
    
    (d-4)  Except as otherwise provided by Subsection (d-3), the provisions of this section other than Subsection (d-2) apply to a supplemental tax bill mailed under Subsection (d-3).
    
    (d-5)  This subsection and Subsections (d-2), (d-3), and (d-4) expire December 31, 2024.
    
    (e)  An assessor may include taxes for more than one taxing unit in the same tax bill, but he shall include the information required by Subsection (c) of this section for the tax imposed by each unit included in the bill.
    
    (f)  A collector may provide that a tax bill not be sent until the total amount of unpaid taxes the collector collects on the property for all taxing units the collector serves is $15 or more.  A collector may not send a tax bill for an amount of taxes less than $15 if before the tax bill is prepared the property owner files a written request with the collector that a tax bill not be sent until the total amount of unpaid taxes the collector collects on the property is $15 or more.  The request applies to all subsequent taxes the collector collects on the property until the property owner in writing revokes the request or the person no longer owns the property. 
    
    (g)  Except as provided by Subsection (f), failure to send or receive the tax bill required by this section, including a tax bill that has been requested to be sent by electronic means under Subsection (k), does not affect the validity of the tax, penalty, or interest, the due date, the existence of a tax lien, or any procedure instituted to collect a tax.
    
    (h)  An assessor who assesses taxes for more than one taxing unit may prepare and deliver separate bills for the taxes of a taxing unit that does not adopt a tax rate for the year before the 60th day after the date the chief appraiser certifies the appraisal roll for the unit under Section [26.01](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.01) of this code or, if the taxing unit participates in more than one appraisal district, before the 60th day after the date it receives a certified appraisal roll from any of the appraisal districts in which it participates.  If separate tax bills are prepared and delivered under this subsection, the taxing unit or taxing units that failed to adopt the tax rate before the prescribed deadline must pay the additional costs incurred in preparing and mailing the separate bills in addition to any other compensation required or agreed to be paid for the appraisal services rendered.
    
    (i)  For a city or town that imposes an additional sales and use tax under Section [321.101](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=321.101)(b) of this code, or a county that imposes a sales and use tax under Chapter [323](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=323) of this code, the tax bill shall indicate the amount of additional ad valorem taxes, if any, that would have been imposed on the property if additional ad valorem taxes had been imposed in an amount equal to the amount of revenue estimated to be collected from the additional city sales and use tax or from the county sales and use tax, as applicable, for the year determined as provided by Section [26.041](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.041) of this code.
    
    (i-1)  If an assessor mails a tax bill under Subsection (a) or delivers a tax bill by electronic means under Subsection (k) to a mortgagee of a property, the assessor is not required to mail or deliver by electronic means a copy of the bill to any mortgagor under the mortgage or to the mortgagor's authorized agent.
    
    (j)  If a tax bill is mailed under Subsection (a) or delivered by electronic means under Subsection (k) to a mortgagee of a property, the mortgagee shall mail a copy of the bill to the owner of the property not more than 30 days following the mortgagee's receipt of the bill.
    
    (k)  The assessor for a taxing unit shall deliver a tax bill as required by this section by electronic means if on or before September 15 the individual or entity entitled to receive a tax bill under this section and the assessor enter into an agreement for delivery of a tax bill by electronic means. An assessor who delivers a tax bill electronically under this subsection is not required to mail the same bill under Subsection (a).  An agreement entered into under this subsection:
    
    (1)  must:
    
    (A)  be in writing or in an electronic format;
    
    (B)  be signed by the assessor and the individual or entity entitled to receive the tax bill under this section;
    
    (C)  be in a format acceptable to the assessor;
    
    (D)  specify the electronic means by which the tax bill is to be delivered; and
    
    (E)  specify the e-mail address to which the tax bill is to be delivered; and
    
    (2)  remains in effect for all subsequent tax bills until revoked by an authorized individual in a written revocation filed with the assessor.
    
    (l)  The comptroller may:
    
    (1)  prescribe acceptable media, formats, content, and methods for the delivery of tax bills by electronic means under Subsection (k); and
    
    (2)  provide a model form agreement.

    Sec. 31.03.  SPLIT PAYMENT OF TAXES.  (a)  The governing body of a taxing unit that collects its own taxes may provide, in the manner required by law for official action by the body, that a person who pays one-half of the unit's taxes before December 1 may pay the remaining one-half of the taxes without penalty or interest before July 1 of the following year.
    
    (b)  Except as provided by Subsection (d), the split-payment option, if adopted, applies to taxes for all units for which the adopting taxing unit collects taxes.
    
    (c)  If one or more taxing units contract with the appraisal district for collection of taxes, the split-payment option provided by Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to taxes collected by the district unless approved by resolution adopted by a majority of the governing bodies of the taxing units whose taxes the district collects and filed with the secretary of the appraisal district board of directors.  After an appraisal district provides for the split-payment option, the option applies to all taxes collected by the district until revoked.  It may be revoked in the same manner as provided for adoption.
    
    (d)  This subsection applies only to a taxing unit located in a county having a population of not less than 315,000 and not more than 351,000 that borders a county having a population of 3.3 million or more and the Gulf of Mexico.  The governing body of a taxing unit that has its taxes collected by another taxing unit that has adopted the split-payment option under Subsection (a) may provide, in the manner required by law for official action by the body, that the split-payment option does not apply to the taxing unit's taxes collected by the other taxing unit.

An individual may not pay less than the total amount due for each installment unless the collector provides for the acceptance of partial payments under this section.

    (c)  The governing body shall require that each property owner permitted to perform service for the taxing unit under this section execute a contract with the taxing unit.  The contract must be executed before the delinquency date and must:
    
    (1)  specify:
    
    (A)  the nature of the service that the property owner will perform for the taxing unit;

The contract must require the property owner to perform the service not later than one year after the delinquency date for the taxes against which the property owner receives credit.
    
    (e)  Taxes for which the property owner is to receive credit under the contract do not become delinquent on the delinquency date otherwise provided by this chapter as long as the contract is in effect and are considered paid when the service is performed.  If the property owner fails to perform the service, or if the taxing unit determines that the service of the property owner is unsatisfactory, the taxing unit shall terminate the contract and notify the property owner of the termination.  The unpaid taxes for which the property owner was to receive credit under the contract for service not yet performed become delinquent and incur penalty and interest provided by Section [33.01](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=33.01) on the later of:

    (g)  Property owners performing services for a taxing unit under this section may only supplement or complement the regular personnel of the taxing unit.  A taxing unit may not reduce the number of persons the taxing unit employs or reduce the number of hours to be worked by employees of the taxing unit because the taxing unit permits property owners to perform services for the taxing unit under this section.
    
    (h)  A person performing service for a taxing unit under this section is not entitled to indemnification from the taxing unit for injury or property damage the person sustains or liability the person incurs in performing service under this section.  The taxing unit is not liable for any damages arising from an act or omission of the person in performing service under this section.

    (D)  the amount of the tax credit that the qualified individual will receive on successful completion of the individual's contractual obligations;  and
    
    (2)  set out or describe the provisions of Subsections (d)-(g).
    
    (d)  A qualified individual who teaches a course for an entire school semester is entitled to a maximum credit of $500 against the taxes imposed, except that if the qualified individual teaches a course for which a student receives a full year's credit for one semester, the qualified individual is entitled to a maximum credit of $1,000 for each such course taught for one semester by the qualified individual.  A qualified individual may not receive credits for teaching more than two courses in any school year.

    (a-1)  If a tax bill is mailed that includes taxes for one or more preceding tax years because the property was erroneously omitted from the tax roll in those tax years, the delinquency date provided by Section [31.02](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=31.02) is postponed to February 1 of the first year that will provide a period of at least 180 days after the date the tax bill is mailed in which to pay the taxes before they become delinquent.
    
    (b)  If the delinquency date is postponed as provided by this section, the assessor who mails the bills shall notify the governing body of each taxing unit whose taxes are included in the bills of the postponement.
    
    (c)  A payment option provided by Section [31.03](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=31.03) of this code or a discount adopted under Section [31.05](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=31.05)(b) of this code does not apply to taxes that are calculated too late for it to be available.

(a)  The governing body of a taxing unit may adopt the discounts provided by Subsection (b) or Subsection (c), or both, in the manner required by law for official action by the body.  The discounts, if adopted, apply only to that taxing unit's taxes.  If a taxing unit adopts both discounts under Subsections (b) and (c), the discounts adopted under Subsection (b) apply unless the tax bills for the unit are mailed after September 30, in which case only the discounts under Subsection (c) apply.  A taxing unit that collects taxes for another taxing unit that adopts the discounts may prepare and mail separate tax bills on behalf of the adopting taxing unit and may charge an additional fee for preparing and mailing the separate tax bills and for collecting the taxes imposed by the adopting taxing unit.  If under an intergovernmental contract a county assessor-collector collects taxes for a taxing unit that adopts the discounts, the county assessor-collector may terminate the contract if the county has adopted a discount policy that is different from the discount policy adopted by the adopting taxing unit.
    
    (b)  A taxing unit may adopt the following discounts to apply regardless of the date on which it mails its tax bills:
    
    (1)  three percent if the tax is paid in October or earlier;
    
    (2)  two percent if the tax is paid in November;  and
    
    (3)  one percent if the tax is paid in December.
    
    (c)  A taxing unit may adopt the following discounts to apply when it mails its tax bills after September 30:

    (a)  Except as provided by Section [31.061](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=31.061), taxes are payable only as provided by this section.  Except as provided by Subsection (e), a collector shall accept United States currency or a check or money order in payment of taxes and shall accept payment by credit card or electronic funds transfer.
    
    (b)  Acceptance by a collector of a check or money order or of payment by credit card constitutes payment of a tax as of the date of acceptance if the check, money order, or credit card invoice is duly paid or honored.  If the check, money order, or credit card invoice is not duly paid or honored, the collector shall deliver written notice of nonpayment to the person who attempted payment by check, money order, or credit card.  Until payment is made in full by cash or by a check, money order, or credit card that is duly paid or honored, the lien securing payment of the tax remains in effect, whether or not the person receives notice of nonpayment.
    
    (c)  If a tax is paid by credit card, the collector may collect a fee for processing the payment.  The collector shall set the fee in an amount that is reasonably related to the expense incurred by the collector or taxing unit in processing the payment by credit card, not to exceed five percent of the amount of taxes and any penalties or interest being paid.  The fee is in addition to the amount of taxes, penalties, or interest.
    
    (d)  If a check or money order accepted in payment of taxes or the invoice for a payment of taxes by credit card is not duly paid or honored, the amount of any charge against the taxing unit for processing the check, order, or credit card invoice is added to the amount of tax due in the same manner as penalties and interest are added for taxes that are delinquent.  The tax lien on the property also secures payment of the amount of the charge.
    
    (e)  A collector may adopt a written policy that requires payment of delinquent taxes, penalties, interest, and costs and expenses recoverable under Section [33.48](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=33.48) only with United States currency, a cashier's check, a certified check, or an electronic funds transfer if the payment relates to:
    
    (1)  personal property seized under Subchapter [B](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=33.21), Chapter [33](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=33);

    Sec. 31.061.  PAYMENT OF TAXES ASSESSED AGAINST REAL PROPERTY BY CONVEYANCE TO TAXING UNIT OF PROPERTY.  (a)  An owner of real property may, subject to the approval of the governing body of all of the taxing units, by deed convey the property to the taxing unit that is owed the largest amount of the taxes, penalties, and interest assessed against the property in payment of the taxes, including delinquent taxes, penalties, and interest assessed against the property by each taxing unit.  The taxing unit acquiring the property holds title to the property on behalf of each taxing unit.  The lien of each taxing unit on the property conveyed is extinguished at the time of the conveyance.  The taxing unit acquiring the property may, subject to the approval of the governing body of another taxing unit, by deed convey the property to that taxing unit.  The taxing unit acquiring the property holds title to the property on behalf of each taxing unit.
    
    (b)  A taxing unit acquiring property under this section may sell the property.  The sale may be conducted in a manner provided by Section [34.05](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=34.05).  If the taxing unit sells the property within six months after the date the owner conveys the property, the taxing unit shall pay to each taxing unit its proportionate share of the sale proceeds according to each taxing unit's share of the total amount of the taxes, penalties, and interest owed at the time of the acquisition.
    
    (c)  A taxing unit that does not sell property acquired under this section within six months after the date the owner conveys the property shall pay to each taxing unit its proportionate share, as determined under Subsection (b), of the appraised market value of the property as shown on the most recent tax roll, less the value of all encumbrances burdening the property.  On making the payment provided by this subsection, the taxing unit owns the property outright and not on behalf of each taxing unit.  The period during which a taxing unit may hold title to the property on behalf of each taxing unit may be extended subject to the approval of the governing body of each taxing unit.
    
    (d)  The collector shall credit against the taxes, penalties, and interest owed each taxing unit:
    
    (1)  the taxing unit's share, as determined under Subsection (b), of the sale price if the property is sold within six months after the date the owner conveys the property;  or
    
    (2)  the taxing unit's share, as determined under Subsection (b), of the appraised market value of the property as shown on the most recent tax roll, less the value of all encumbrances burdening the property, if the property is not sold within six months after the date the owner conveys the property.
    
    (e)  The owner remains personally liable to each taxing unit to the extent the amount of the taxes, penalties, and interest owed each taxing unit exceeds the amount credited under Subsection (d).  The owner is entitled to a refund from each taxing unit to the extent the amount credited under Subsection (d) exceeds the amount of the taxes, penalties, and interest owed the taxing unit.
    
    (f)  A conveyance of property to a taxing unit under this section is voidable by the taxing unit at any time that the taxing unit owns the property and determines that the condition of the property on the date the owner conveyed it was or may have been in violation of a federal or state law, regulation, rule, or order.  If the taxing unit voids the conveyance:
    
    (1)  the taxing unit shall execute a quitclaim deed of the property to the owner, file the deed in the county records, and give notice of the deed and its filing to the owner;
    
    (2)  the collector shall remove the credit against the taxes, penalties, and interest owed each taxing unit made under this section;
    
    (3)  a taxing unit that does not acquire the property shall refund the payment made to it by the taxing unit that acquires the property and reinstate the taxes, penalties, and interest owed the taxing unit;  and
    
    (4)  the lien of each taxing unit is reinstated as of the date it originally attached.

    Sec. 31.07.  CERTAIN PAYMENTS ACCEPTED.  (a)  A person may pay the tax imposed on any one property without simultaneously paying taxes imposed on other property he owns.
    
    (b)  A collector shall accept payment of the tax imposed on a property by a taxing unit that has adopted the discounts under Section [31.05](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=31.05) of this code separately from taxes imposed on that property by other taxing units using the same collector, even if the taxes are included in the same bill.  The collector may adopt a policy of accepting separate payments in other circumstances.  If the tax paid is included in the same bill as other taxes that are not paid, the collector shall send a revised bill or receipt to reflect the tax payment, if a discount applies to the payment, and may send a revised bill or receipt to reflect the tax payment in other circumstances.  The sending of a revised bill does not affect the date on which the unpaid taxes become delinquent.
    
    (c)  A collector may adopt a policy of accepting partial payments of property taxes.  A payment option provided by Section [31.03](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=31.03) of this code or a discount adopted under Section [31.05](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=31.05) of this code does not apply to any portion of a partial payment.  If a collector accepts a partial payment on a tax bill that includes taxes for more than one taxing unit, the collector shall allocate the partial payment among all the taxing units included in the bill in proportion to the amount of tax included in the bill for each taxing unit, unless the collector under Subsection (b) has adopted a policy of accepting payments of a taxing unit's taxes separate from the taxes of other taxing units included in the same bill and the taxpayer directs that the partial payment be allocated in specific amounts to one or more specific taxing units. Acceptance of a partial payment does not affect the date that the tax becomes delinquent, but the penalties and interest provided by Section [33.01](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=33.01) of this code are incurred only by the portion of a tax that remains unpaid on the date the tax becomes delinquent.
    
    (d)  Notwithstanding Subsection (c), a collector shall accept a partial payment of property taxes on a tax bill that includes taxes for more than one taxing unit if one or more of the taxing units has adopted the discounts under Section [31.05](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=31.05) of this code, the taxpayer directs that the partial payment be allocated first to the payment of the taxes owed one or more of the taxing units that have adopted the discounts, and the amount of the payment is equal to or greater than the amount of the taxes owed the taxing units designated by the taxpayer.

    Sec. 31.071.  CONDITIONAL PAYMENTS.  (a)  The collector of a taxing unit shall accept conditional payments of taxes before the delinquency date for property taxes that are subject to a pending challenge or protest.
    
    (b)  A property owner whose property is subject to a pending protest or challenge may pay the tax due on the amount of value of the property involved in the pending action that is not in dispute or the amount of tax paid on the property in the preceding year, whichever is greater, but not to exceed the amount of tax that would be due on the appraised value that is subject to protest or challenge.  The collector of the taxing unit shall provide the property owner with a temporary receipt of taxes paid under this section.
    
    (c)  If the property is no longer subject to a challenge, protest, or appeal at any time before the delinquency date, the collector shall apply the amount paid by the property owner under this section to the tax imposed on the property and shall refund the remainder, if any, to the property owner.  If the property is still subject to an appeal on the last working day before the delinquency date, or at an earlier date if so requested by the property owner, the collector shall apply the amount paid under this section to the payment required by Section [42.08](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=42.08)(b) of this code and shall retain the remainder, if any, until the appeal is completed.  When the appeal is completed, the collector shall apply any amount retained under this section to the tax ultimately imposed on the property that is not covered by the payment under Section [42.08](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=42.08)(b) and shall refund the remainder, if any, to the property owner.

    Sec. 31.072.  ESCROW ACCOUNTS.  (a)  The collector for a taxing unit may enter a contract with a property owner under which the property owner deposits money in an escrow account maintained by the collector to provide for the payment of property taxes collected by the collector on any property the person owns.
    
    (b)  A contract may not be made before October 1 of the year preceding the tax year for which the account is established.  The collector may agree to establish a combined account for more than one item of property having the same owner on the property owner's request.  If a collector collects taxes for more than one taxing unit, an account must apply to taxes on the affected property for each of the taxing units.
    
    (c)  A contract under this section must require the property owner to make monthly deposits to the escrow account until the amount set in the contract under Subsection (d) of this section accrues in the account or until the tax bill for the property is prepared, whichever occurs earlier.
    
    (d)  On request by a property owner to establish an escrow account under this section, the collector shall estimate the amount of taxes to be imposed on the property by the affected taxing units in that year.  A contract to establish an escrow account must provide for deposits that would provide, as of the date the collector estimates the tax bill for the property will be prepared, a total deposit that is not less than the amount of taxes estimated by the collector or the amount of taxes imposed on the property by the affected taxing units in the preceding year, whichever is less.  The collector may agree to a deposit of a greater amount on the property owner's request.
    
    (e)  The county tax assessor-collector shall maintain the escrow account in the county depository.  Any other collector shall maintain the escrow account in the depository of the taxing unit or other entity that employs the collector.  The collector is not required to maintain a separate account in the depository for each escrow account but shall maintain separate records for each escrow account.
    
    (f)  The property owner may withdraw from the collector the money the owner deposited in an escrow account only if the withdrawal is made before the date the tax bill is prepared or October 1 of the tax year, whichever occurs earlier.  On and after that date and until the taxes are paid, the collector must agree to a withdrawal by the taxpayer.  The property owner may not withdraw less than the total amount deposited in the escrow account.
    
    (g)  When the tax bill is prepared for property for which an escrow account is established, the collector shall apply the money in the account to the taxes imposed and deliver a tax receipt to the taxpayer together with a refund of any amount in the account in excess of the amount of taxes paid.  If the amount in the escrow account is not sufficient to pay the taxes in full, the collector shall apply the money to the taxes and deliver to the taxpayer a tax receipt for the partial payment and a tax bill for the unpaid amount.  If the escrow account applies to more than one taxing unit or to more than one item of property, the collector shall apply the amount to each taxing unit or item of property in proportion to the amount of taxes imposed unless the contract provides otherwise.
    
    (h)  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), if the property owner requesting a collector to establish an escrow account under this section is a disabled veteran as defined by Section [11.22](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.22) or a recipient of the Purple Heart, the Congressional Medal of Honor, the Bronze Star Medal, the Silver Star, the Legion of Merit, or a service cross awarded by a branch of the United States armed forces and the escrow account is to be used solely to provide for the payment of property taxes collected by the collector on the property owner's residence homestead, the collector shall enter into a contract with the property owner under this section.
    
    (i)  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), if the property owner requesting a collector to establish an escrow account under this section is the owner of a manufactured home and the escrow account is to be used solely to provide for the payment of property taxes collected by the collector on the property owner's manufactured home, the collector shall enter into a contract with the property owner under this section.

(a)  This section applies only to a person who purchases a business, an interest in a business, or the inventory of a business from a person who is liable under this title for the payment of taxes imposed on personal property used in the operation of that business.
    
    (b)  The purchaser shall withhold from the purchase price an amount sufficient to pay all of the taxes imposed on the personal property of the business, plus any penalties and interest incurred, until the seller provides the purchaser with:
    
    (1)  a receipt issued by each appropriate collector showing that the taxes due the applicable taxing unit, plus any penalties and interest, have been paid;  or
    
    (2)  a tax certificate issued under Section [31.08](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=31.08) stating that no taxes, penalties, or interest is due the applicable taxing unit.
    
    (c)  A purchaser who fails to withhold the amount required by this section is liable for that amount to the applicable taxing units to the extent of the value of the purchase price, including the value of a promissory note given in consideration of the sale to the extent of the note's market value on the effective date of the purchase, regardless of whether the purchaser has been required to make any payments on that note.
    
    (d)  The purchaser may request each appropriate collector to issue a tax certificate under Section [31.08](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=31.08) or a statement of the amount of the taxes, penalties, and interest that are due to each taxing unit for which the collector collects taxes.  The collector shall issue the certificate or statement before the 10th day after the date the request is made.  If a collector does not timely provide or mail the certificate or statement to the purchaser, the purchaser is released from the duties and liabilities imposed by Subsections (b) and (c) in connection with taxes, penalties, and interest due the applicable taxing unit.
    
    (e)  An action to enforce a duty or liability imposed on a purchaser by Subsection (b) or (c) must be brought before the fourth anniversary of the effective date of the purchase.  An action to enforce the purchaser's duty or liability is subject to a limitation plea by the purchaser as to any taxes that have been delinquent at least four years as of the date the collector issues the statement under Subsection (d).
    
    (f)  This section does not release a person who sells a business or the inventory of a business from any personal liability imposed on the person for the payment of taxes imposed on the personal property of the business or for penalties or interest on those taxes.
    
    (g)  For purposes of this section:
    
    (1)  a person is considered to have purchased a business if the person purchases the name of the business or the goodwill associated with the business;  and
    
    (2)  a person is considered to have purchased the inventory of a business if the person purchases inventory of a business, the value of which is at least 50 percent of the value of the total inventory of the business on the date of the purchase.

    (c)  Except as otherwise provided by Subsection (d) of this section, at least monthly the collector for a taxing unit shall deposit in the unit's depository all taxes collected for the unit.  The governing body of a unit may require deposits to be made more frequently.
    
    (d)  If the taxes of a taxing unit are collected by the collector or other officer or employee of another taxing unit or by an appraisal district as provided by the law creating or authorizing creation of the unit or as the result of an election held under Section [6.26](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=6.26) of this code, the entity that collects the taxes shall deposit the taxes in the unit's depository daily, unless the governing body of that unit by official action provides that those deposits may be made less often than daily.

    Sec. 31.11.  REFUNDS OF OVERPAYMENTS OR ERRONEOUS PAYMENTS.  (a)  If a taxpayer applies to the tax collector of a taxing unit for a refund of an overpayment or erroneous payment of taxes, the collector for the unit determines that the payment was erroneous or excessive, and the auditor for the unit agrees with the collector's determination, the collector shall refund the amount of the excessive or erroneous payment from available current tax collections or from funds appropriated by the unit for making refunds.  However, the collector may not make the refund unless:
    
    (1)  in the case of a collector who collects taxes for one taxing unit, the governing body of the taxing unit also determines that the payment was erroneous or excessive and approves the refund if the amount of the refund exceeds:
    
    (A)  $5,000 for a refund to be paid by a county with a population of 2.5 million or more; or
    
    (B)  $500 for a refund to be paid by any other taxing unit; or
    
    (2)  in the case of a collector who collects taxes for more than one taxing unit, the governing body of the taxing unit that employs the collector also determines that the payment was erroneous or excessive and approves the refund if the amount of the refund exceeds:
    
    (A)  $5,000 for a refund to be paid by a county with a population of 2.5 million or more; or
    
    (B)  $2,500 for a refund to be paid by any other taxing unit.
    
    (b)  A taxing unit that determines a taxpayer is delinquent in ad valorem tax payments on property other than the property for which liability for a refund arises or for a tax year other than the tax year for which liability for a refund arises may apply the amount of an overpayment or erroneous payment to the payment of the delinquent taxes if the taxpayer was the sole owner of the property:
    
    (1)  for which the refund is sought on January 1 of the tax year in which the taxes that were overpaid or erroneously paid were assessed; and
    
    (2)  on which the taxes are delinquent on January 1 of the tax year for which the delinquent taxes were assessed.
    
    (c)  Except as provided by Subsection (c-1), an application for a refund must be made within three years after the date of the payment or the taxpayer waives the right to the refund.  A taxpayer may apply for a refund by filing:
    
    (1)  an application on a form prescribed by the comptroller by rule; or
    
    (2)  a written request that includes information sufficient to enable the collector and the auditor for the taxing unit and, if applicable, the governing body of the taxing unit to determine whether the taxpayer is entitled to the refund.
    
    (c-1)  The governing body of the taxing unit may extend the deadline provided by Subsection (c) for a single period not to exceed two years on a showing of good cause by the taxpayer.
    
    (d)  The collector for a taxing unit shall provide a copy of the refund application form without charge on request of a taxpayer or a taxpayer's representative.
    
    (e)  An application for a refund must:
    
    (1)  include an affirmation by the taxpayer that the information in the application is true and correct;  and
    
    (2)  be signed by the taxpayer.
    
    (f)  This subsection applies only to a refund that is required to be approved by the governing body of a taxing unit.  The presiding officer of the governing body of the taxing unit is not required to sign the application for the refund or any document accompanying the application to indicate the governing body's approval or disapproval of the refund.  The collector for the taxing unit shall indicate on the application whether the governing body approved or disapproved the refund and the date of the approval or disapproval.
    
    (g)  If a taxpayer submits a payment of taxes that exceeds by $5 or more the amount of taxes owed for a tax year to a taxing unit, the collector for the taxing unit, without charge, shall mail to the taxpayer or the taxpayer's representative a written notice of the amount of the overpayment accompanied by a refund application form.
    
    (h)  This section does not apply to an overpayment caused by a change of exemption status or correction of a tax roll, including an overpayment received after a correction of a tax roll as a result of an appeal under Chapter [42](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=42).  Such an overpayment is covered by Section [26.15](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.15) or [42.43](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=42.43), as applicable.
    
    (i)  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, in the case of an overpayment or erroneous payment of taxes submitted by a taxpayer to a collector who collects taxes for one or more taxing units one of which is a county with a population of 2.5 million or more:
    
    (1)  a taxpayer is not required to apply to the collector for the refund to be entitled to receive the refund if the amount of the refund is at least $5 but does not exceed $5,000; and
    
    (2)  the collector is not required to comply with Subsection (g) unless the amount of the payment exceeds by more than $5,000 the amount of taxes owed for a tax year to a taxing unit for which the collector collects taxes.
    
    (j)  If the collector for a taxing unit does not respond to an application for a refund on or before the 90th day after the date the application is filed with the collector, the application is presumed to have been denied.
    
    (k)  Not later than the 60th day after the date the collector for a taxing unit denies an application for a refund, the taxpayer may file suit against the taxing unit in district court to compel the payment of the refund.  If the collector collects taxes for more than one taxing unit, the taxpayer shall join in the suit each taxing unit on behalf of which the collector denied the refund.  If the taxpayer prevails in the suit, the taxpayer may be awarded:
    
    (1)  costs of court; and
    
    (2)  reasonable attorney's fees in an amount not to exceed the greater of:
    
    (A)  $1,500; or
    
    (B)  30 percent of the total amount of the refund determined by the court to be due.
