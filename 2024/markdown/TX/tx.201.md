    (c)  High-cost gas produced from a well that is spudded or completed after August 31, 1996, is entitled to a reduction of the tax imposed by this chapter for the first 120 consecutive calendar months beginning on the first day of production, or until the cumulative value of the tax reduction equals 50 percent of the drilling and completion costs incurred for the well, whichever occurs first.  The amount of tax reduction shall be computed by subtracting from the tax rate imposed by Section [201.052](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=201.052) the product of that tax rate times the ratio of drilling and completion costs incurred for the well to twice the median drilling and completion costs for high-cost wells spudded or completed during the previous state fiscal year, except that the effective rate of tax may not be reduced below zero.
    
    (d)  Repealed by Acts 2017, 85th Leg., R.S., Ch. 358 (H.B. [2277](http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/85R/billtext/html/HB02277F.HTM)), Sec. 3, eff. September 1, 2017.
    
    (e)  The operator of a proposed or existing gas well, including a gas well that has not been completed, may apply to the commission for certification that the well produces or will produce high-cost gas.  The application may be made at any time after the first day of production.  The application may be made but is not required to be made concurrently with a request for a determination that gas produced from the well is high-cost natural gas for purposes of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (15 U.S.C. Section 3301 et seq.).  The commission may require an applicant to provide the commission with any relevant information required to administer this section.  For purposes of this section, a determination that gas is high-cost natural gas for purposes of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (15 U.S.C. Section 3301 et seq.) is a certification that the gas is high-cost gas for purposes of this section, and in that event additional certification is not required to qualify for the tax reduction provided by this section.
    
    (f)  To qualify for the tax reduction provided by this section, the person responsible for paying the tax must apply to the comptroller.  The application must contain the certification of the commission that the well produces high-cost gas and must contain a report of drilling and completion costs incurred for each well on a form and in the detail as determined by the comptroller.  Drilling and completion costs for a recompletion shall only include current and contemporaneous costs associated with the recompletion.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, to obtain the maximum tax reduction, an application to the comptroller for certification according to Subsection (a)(2) must be filed with the comptroller at the later of the 180th day after the date of first production or the 45th day after the date of approval by the commission.  If the application is not filed by the applicable deadline, the tax reduction is reduced by 10 percent for the period beginning on the 180th day after the first day of production and ending on the date on which the application is filed with the comptroller.   The comptroller shall approve the application of a person who demonstrates that the gas is eligible for the tax reduction.  The comptroller may require a person applying for the tax reduction to provide any relevant information in the person's monthly report that the comptroller considers necessary to administer this section.  The commission shall notify the comptroller in writing immediately if it determines that a well previously certified as producing high-cost gas does not produce high-cost gas or if it takes any action or discovers any information that affects the eligibility of gas for a tax reduction under this section.
    
    (g)  As soon as practicable after March 1 of each year, the comptroller shall determine the median drilling and completion cost for all high-cost wells for which an application for a tax reduction was made during the previous state fiscal year.  In making the determination, the comptroller shall use the drilling and completion cost data required to be reported to the comptroller under Subsection (f).  The median drilling and completion cost shall be used to compute the reduced tax under Subsection (c) and is fixed on the date of the comptroller's determination under this subsection.
    
    (g-1)  The report of drilling and completion costs required under Subsection (f) may not be amended after March 1 of the year following the state fiscal year in which the application was made.
    
    (h)  Information regarding drilling and completion costs included on an application under Subsection (f) is confidential and may not be disclosed, except to the extent aggregated with other similar information to produce industry averages.  Unauthorized disclosure is an offense subject to the same penalty as provided by Section [111.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=111.007) for unauthorized disclosure of federal tax return information.
    
    (i)  If, before the commission certifies that a well produces high-cost gas or before the comptroller approves an application for a tax reduction under this section, the tax imposed by this chapter is paid on high-cost gas that otherwise qualifies for the tax reduction provided by this section, the person who remitted the tax is entitled to a refund in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of the tax paid on the gas and the amount of tax that would have been paid on the gas if it had received a tax reduction under this section. The total allowable refund for taxes paid for reporting periods before the date the application is filed may not exceed the total tax paid on the gas that otherwise qualified for the tax reduction and that was produced during the 24 consecutive calendar months immediately preceding the month in which the application for certification under this section that the comptroller approved was filed with the commission.   To receive a refund, the person entitled to the refund must apply to the comptroller for the refund not later than the first anniversary after the date the comptroller approves the application for a tax reduction under this section. 
    
    (j)  Repealed by Acts 2017, 85th Leg., R.S., Ch. 358 (H.B. [2277](http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/85R/billtext/html/HB02277F.HTM)), Sec. 3, eff. September 1, 2017.

    SUBCHAPTER C. DETERMINING VALUE
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 201.101.  MARKET VALUE.  (a)  The market value of gas is its value at the mouth of the well from which it is produced.  The value of gas at the mouth of the well is determined by ascertaining the producer's actual marketing costs and subtracting those costs from the producer's gross cash receipts from the sale of the gas.
    
    (b)  Marketing costs are the costs incurred by the producer to get the gas from the mouth of the well to the market, including:
    
    (1)  costs for compressing the gas sold;
    
    (2)  costs for dehydrating the gas sold;
    
    (3)  costs for sweetening the gas sold;  and
    
    (4)  costs for delivering the gas to the purchaser.
    
    (c)  Marketing costs do not include:
    
    (1)  costs incurred in producing the gas;
    
    (2)  costs incurred in normal lease separation of the oil or condensate;  or
    
    (3)  insurance premiums on the marketing facility.
    
    (d)  Marketing costs are determined by adding:
    
    (1)  a reasonable charge for depreciation of the marketing facility being used, provided that, if the facility is rented, the actual rental fee is added;
    
    (2)  a return on the producer-owned investment equal to six percent per year on the average depreciable balance;
    
    (3)  costs of direct or allocated labor associated with the marketing facility;
    
    (4)  costs of materials, supplies, maintenance, repairs, and fuel associated with the marketing facility;  and
    
    (5)  ad valorem taxes paid on the marketing facility.
    
    (e)  If the facility is used for a purpose other than marketing the gas being sold, the cost shall be allocated accordingly.
    
    (f)  If the facility is handling gas for outside parties, the average cost for handling all of the gas shall be applied against the facility owner's gas.
    
    (g)  The actual cost being charged a producer by an outside party for marketing functions may be used for tax purposes if no other benefit or value accrues to the producer.
    
    (h)  A producer receiving a cost reimbursement from the gas purchaser shall include the reimbursement in the gross cash receipts and is entitled to deduct the actual marketing costs incurred.

    Sec. 201.102.  CASH SALES.  If gas is sold for cash only, the tax shall be computed on the producer's gross cash receipts.  Payments from a purchaser of gas to a producer for the purpose of reimbursing the producer for taxes due under this chapter are not part of the gross cash receipts.

    Sec. 201.104.  RETURNED CYCLE GAS.  (a)  If gas is processed for its liquid hydrocarbon content and the residue gas is returned to a gas-producing formation by cycling methods, as distinguished from repressuring or pressure maintenance methods, the taxable value of the gas is three-fifths the value of all liquid hydrocarbons extracted, separated, and saved from the gas.
    
    (b)  The value of the liquid hydrocarbons for the purpose of this section is the highest posted price of crude oil in the field where the gas is produced.  If no oil is produced in that field, the value is the highest posted price for crude oil in the nearest oil field.
    
    (c)  The value of the liquid hydrocarbons is determined when they are extracted and separated from gas and before they are absorbed, refined, or processed.  The quantity of the liquid hydrocarbons is the yield from the gas at the processing plant.
    
    (d)  The valuation method prescribed by this section controls over the valuation methods described in Sections [201.102](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=201.102) and [201.103](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=201.103) of this code only in circumstances in which Subsection (a) of this section applies.

    Sec. 201.105.  VALUE OF LIQUID HYDROCARBONS OTHER THAN CONDENSATE.  The taxable value of liquid hydrocarbons other than condensate is the producer's total gross receipts for all liquid hydrocarbons, including condensate, recovered from gas produced by him less the taxable value of the condensate recovered from that gas.

This subsection does not apply to any amount collected by the taxpayer that was a tax or represented to be a tax but that was not remitted to this state.
