    (2)  on personal property, in the county where the taxpayer resided at the time the tax became due and payable or in the county where the taxpayer filed the report.
    
    (b)  This section applies to a bona fide purchaser, mortgagee, holder of a deed of trust, judgment creditor, or any other person who acquired the lien, title, or right or interest in the property for bona fide consideration.
    
    
    
    
    Acts 1981, 67th Leg., p. 1520, ch. 389, Sec. 1, eff. Jan. 1, 1982.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 113.102.  APPLICABILITY OF LIEN TO MERCHANDISE PURCHASED.  No lien created by this title is effective against a bona fide purchaser for value of goods, wares, or merchandise daily exposed for sale in the regular course of business if the purchase and actual or constructive possession of the goods, wares, or merchandise is completed before the goods, wares, or merchandise are seized under a valid legal writ or other lawful process.
    
    
    
    
    Acts 1981, 67th Leg., p. 1520, ch. 389, Sec. 1, eff. Jan. 1, 1982.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 113.103.  APPLICABILITY OF LIEN TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.  (a)  A bank or savings and loan institution is not required to recognize the claim of the state to a deposit or to withhold payment of a deposit to a depositor or to the depositor's order unless the bank or institution has been served by the comptroller with a notice of the state's claim.
    
    (b)  Notice of a state claim must be in writing and be served by certified mail to the bank or institution or served personally on the president or any vice-president, cashier, or assistant cashier of the bank or institution.

    (b)  The transfer of property or an interest in property by a person who at the time of the transfer is insolvent and has received or withheld money as a tax under this title or who is delinquent in the payment of a tax imposed by this title is a preferential transfer if the transfer occurred during the six-month period before the date of the filing of a tax lien notice against the transferor as permitted by this chapter and if the transfer is made with intent to defraud the state.  The transfer of the property or the interest in property without adequate and sufficient consideration creates a rebuttable presumption that the transfer was made with intent to defraud the state.  A transfer with sufficient consideration creates a rebuttable presumption that the transfer was not made with intent to defraud the state.
    
    (c)  All property subject to execution of a transferee in a preferential transfer is subject to a prior lien in favor of the state to secure the recovery of the value of the property transferred in a preferential transfer.

    Sec. 113.106.  LIEN;  SUIT TO DETERMINE VALIDITY.  (a)  In an action to determine the validity of a state tax lien, the lien shall be:
    
    (1)  perpetuated and foreclosed;  or
    
    (2)  nullified.
    
    (b)  If a lien is perpetuated and foreclosed, no further action or notice on the judgment is required, and the notice of the state tax lien on record continues in effect.
    
    (c)  If all or part of a lien is nullified, a certified copy of the judgment may be filed with the county clerk of the county where the tax lien notice was filed and may be recorded in the same manner as a release by the comptroller.
    
    (d)  Execution, order for sale, or other process for the enforcement of the lien may be issued on the judgment at any time.
    
    (e)  A person must bring suit to determine the validity of a state tax lien not later than the 10th anniversary of the date the lien was filed. If more than one state tax lien has been filed relating to the same tax liability, the 10-year limitation period provided by this subsection is calculated from the date of the filing of the first lien relating to the liability.
    
    (f)  A taxpayer is presumed to have received proper notice of the taxpayer's tax liability if the notice is delivered to the taxpayer's last address of record with the comptroller. The taxpayer may rebut the presumption by presenting substantive evidence that demonstrates that notice of the tax liability was not received. If the taxpayer rebuts the presumption of receipt of proper notice with evidence the comptroller considers satisfactory, the period of limitations for filing suit provided by Subsection (e) does not apply.
