    SUBCHAPTER A. TAX SALES
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 34.01.  SALE OF PROPERTY.  (a)  Real property seized under a tax warrant issued under Subchapter [E](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=33.91), Chapter [33](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=33), or ordered sold pursuant to foreclosure of a tax lien shall be sold by the officer charged with selling the property, unless otherwise directed by the taxing unit that requested the warrant or order of sale or by an authorized agent or attorney for that unit.  The sale shall be conducted in the manner similar property is sold under execution except as otherwise provided by this subtitle.
    
    (a-1)  The commissioners court of a county by official action may authorize the officer charged with selling property under this section to conduct a public auction using online bidding and sale.  The commissioners court may adopt rules governing online auctions authorized under this subsection.  Rules adopted by the commissioners court under this subsection take effect on the 90th day after the date the rules are published in the real property records of the county.
    
    (b)  On receipt of an order of sale of real property, the officer charged with selling the property shall endorse on the order the date and exact time when the officer received the order.  The endorsement is a levy on the property without necessity for going upon the ground.  The officer shall calculate the total amount due under the judgment, including all taxes, penalties, and interest, plus any other amount awarded by the judgment, court costs, and the costs of the sale.  The costs of a sale include the costs of advertising, an auctioneer's commission and fees, and deed recording fees anticipated to be paid in connection with the sale of the property.  To assist the officer in making the calculation, the collector of any taxing unit that is party to the judgment may provide the officer with a certified tax statement showing the amount of the taxes included in the judgment that remain due that taxing unit and all penalties, interest, and attorney's fees provided by the judgment as of the date of the proposed sale.  If a certified tax statement is provided to the officer, the officer shall rely on the amount included in the statement and is not responsible or liable for the accuracy of the applicable portion of the calculation.  A certified tax statement is not required to be sworn to and is sufficient if the tax collector or the collector's deputy signs the statement.
    
    (c)  The officer charged with the sale shall give written notice of the sale in the manner prescribed by Rule 21a, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, or that rule's successor to each person who was a defendant to the judgment or that person's attorney.
    
    (d)  An officer's failure to send the written notice of sale or a defendant's failure to receive that notice is insufficient by itself to invalidate:
    
    (1)  the sale of the property;  or
    
    (2)  the title conveyed by that sale.
    
    (e)  A notice of sale under Subsection (c) must substantially comply with this subsection. The notice must include:
    
    (1)  a statement of the authority under which the sale is to be made;
    
    (2)  the date, time, and location of the sale;
    
    (3)  a brief description of the property to be sold; and
    
    (4)  the statement required by Section [232.0315](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=232.0315), Local Government Code, if the real property subject to the sale is located in a county subject to Subchapter B, Chapter 232, of that code and is presumed to be for residential use under Section 232.022 of that code.
    
    (f)  A notice of sale is not required to include field notes describing the property.  A description of the property is sufficient if the notice:
    
    (1)  states the number of acres and identifies the original survey;
    
    (2)  as to property located in a platted subdivision or addition, regardless of whether the subdivision or addition is recorded, states the name by which the land is generally known with reference to that subdivision or addition;  or
    
    (3)  by reference adopts the description of the property contained in the judgment.
    
    (g)  For publishing a notice of sale, a newspaper may charge a rate that does not exceed the greater of:
    
    (1)  two cents per word;  or
    
    (2)  an amount equal to the published word or line rate of that newspaper for the same class of advertising.
    
    (h)  If there is not a newspaper published in the county of the sale, or a newspaper that will publish the notice of sale for the rate authorized by Subsection (g), the officer shall post the notice in writing in three public places in the county not later than the 20th day before the date of the sale.  One of the notices must be posted at the door of the county courthouse.
    
    (i)  The owner of real property subject to sale may file with the officer charged with the sale a written request that the property be divided and that only as many portions be sold as necessary to pay the amount due against the property, as calculated under Subsection (b).  In the request the owner shall describe the desired portions and shall specify the order in which the portions should be sold.  The owner may not specify more than four portions or a portion that divides a building or other contiguous improvement.  The request must be delivered to the officer not later than the seventh day before the date of the sale.
    
    (j)  If a bid sufficient to pay the lesser of the amount calculated under Subsection (b) or the adjudged value is not received, the taxing unit that requested the order of sale may terminate the sale.  If the taxing unit does not terminate the sale, the officer making the sale shall bid the property off to the taxing unit that requested the order of sale, unless otherwise agreed by each other taxing unit that is a party to the judgment, for the aggregate amount of the judgment against the property or for the market value of the property as specified in the judgment, whichever is less.  The duty of the officer conducting the sale to bid off the property to a taxing unit under this subsection is self-executing.  The actual attendance of a representative of the taxing unit at the sale is not a prerequisite to that duty.
    
    (k)  The taxing unit to which the property is bid off takes title to the property for the use and benefit of itself and all other taxing units that established tax liens in the suit.  The taxing unit's title includes all the interest owned by the defendant, including the defendant's right to the use and possession of the property, subject only to the defendant's right of redemption.  Payments in satisfaction of the judgment and any costs or expenses of the sale may not be required of the purchasing taxing unit until the property is redeemed or resold by the purchasing taxing unit.
    
    (l)  Notwithstanding that property is bid off to a taxing unit under this section, a taxing unit that established a tax lien in the suit may continue to enforce collection of any amount for which a former owner of the property is liable to the taxing unit, including any post-judgment taxes, penalties, and interest, in any other manner provided by law.
    
    (m)  The officer making the sale shall prepare a deed to the purchaser of real property at the sale, to any other person whom the purchaser may specify, or to the taxing unit to which the property was bid off.  The taxing unit that requested the order of sale may elect to prepare a deed for execution by the officer.  If the taxing unit prepares the deed, the officer shall execute that deed.  An officer who executes a deed prepared by the taxing unit is not responsible or liable for any inconsistency, error, or other defect in the form of the deed.  As soon as practicable after a deed is executed by the officer, the officer shall either file the deed for recording with the county clerk or deliver the executed deed to the taxing unit that requested the order of sale, which shall file the deed for recording with the county clerk.  The county clerk shall file and record each deed filed under this subsection and after recording shall return the deed to the grantee.
    
    (n)  The deed vests good and perfect title in the purchaser or the purchaser's assigns to the interest owned by the defendant in the property subject to the foreclosure, including the defendant's right to the use and possession of the property, subject only to the defendant's right of redemption, the terms of a recorded restrictive covenant running with the land that was recorded before January 1 of the year in which the tax lien on the property arose, a recorded lien that arose under that restrictive covenant that was not extinguished in the judgment foreclosing the tax lien, and each valid easement of record as of the date of the sale that was recorded before January 1 of the year the tax lien arose.  The deed may be impeached only for fraud.
    
    (o)  If a bid sufficient to pay the amount specified by Subsection (p) is not received, the officer making the sale, with the consent of the collector who applied for the tax warrant, may offer property seized under Subchapter [E](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=33.91), Chapter [33](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=33), to a person described by Section [11.181](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.181) or [11.20](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.20) for less than that amount.  If the property is offered to a person described by Section [11.181](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.181) or [11.20](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.20), the officer making the sale shall reopen the bidding at the amount of that person's bid and bid off the property to the highest bidder.  Consent to the sale by the taxing units entitled to receive proceeds of the sale is not required.  The acceptance of a bid by the officer under this subsection is conclusive and binding on the question of its sufficiency.  An action to set aside the sale on the grounds that a bid is insufficient may not be sustained, except that a taxing unit that participates in distribution of proceeds of the sale may file an action before the first anniversary of the date of the sale to set aside the sale on the grounds of fraud or collusion between the officer making the sale and the purchaser.
    
    (p)  Except as provided by Subsection (o), property seized under Subchapter [E](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=33.91), Chapter [33](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=33), may not be sold for an amount that is less than the lesser of the market value of the property as specified in the warrant or the total amount of taxes, penalties, interest, costs, auctioneer's commission and fees, and other claims for which the warrant was issued.  If a sufficient bid is not received by the officer making the sale, the officer shall bid off the property to a taxing unit in the manner specified by Subsection (j) and subject to the other provisions of that subsection.  A taxing unit that takes title to property under this subsection takes title for the use and benefit of that taxing unit and all other taxing units that established tax liens in the suit or that, on the date of the seizure, were owed delinquent taxes on the property.
    
    (q)  A sale of property under this section to a purchaser other than a taxing unit:
    
    (1)  extinguishes each lien securing payment of the delinquent taxes, penalties, and interest against that property and included in the judgment;  and
    
    (2)  does not affect the personal liability of any person for those taxes, penalties, and interest included in the judgment that are not satisfied from the proceeds of the sale.
    
    (r)  Except as provided by Subsection (a-1) and this subsection, a sale of real property under this section must take place at the county courthouse in the county in which the land is located.  The commissioners court of the county may designate an area other than an area at the county courthouse where sales under this section will take place that is in a public place within a reasonable proximity of the county courthouse as determined by the commissioners court and in a location as accessible to the public as the courthouse door.  The commissioners court shall record that designation in the real property records of the county.  A designation by a commissioners court under this section is not a ground for challenging or invalidating any sale.  A sale must be held at an area designated under this subsection if the sale is held on or after the 90th day after the date the designation is recorded.
    
    (r-1)  A sale of real property under this section, other than a sale conducted by means of a public auction using online bidding and sale under Subsection (a-1), must take place between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. on the first Tuesday of a month or, if the first Tuesday of a month occurs on January 1 or July 4, between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. on the first Wednesday of the month.
    
    (r-2)  A sale of real property conducted by means of a public auction using online bidding and sale under Subsection (a-1) may begin at any time and must conclude at 4 p.m. on the first Tuesday of a month or, if the first Tuesday of a month occurs on January 1 or July 4, at 4 p.m. on the first Wednesday of the month.
    
    (s)  To the extent of a conflict between this section and a provision of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure that relates to an execution, this section controls.

    (c)  On the written request of any person, a county assessor-collector shall issue a written statement stating whether there are any delinquent taxes owed by the person to that county or to a school district or municipality having territory in that county.  A request for the issuance of a statement by the county assessor-collector under this subsection must:
    
    (1)  sufficiently identify any property subject to taxation by the county or by a school district or municipality having territory in the county, regardless of whether the property is located in the county, that the person owns or formerly owned so that the county assessor-collector and the collector for each school district or municipality having territory in the county may determine whether the property is included on a current or a cumulative delinquent tax roll for the county, the school district, or the municipality under Section [33.03](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=33.03);
    
    (2)  specify the address to which the county assessor-collector should send the statement;
    
    (3)  include any additional information reasonably required by the county assessor-collector;  and
    
    (4)  be sworn to and signed by the person requesting the statement.

    (d)  On receipt of a request under Subsection (c), the county assessor-collector shall send to the collector for each school district and municipality having territory in the county, other than a school district or municipality for which the county assessor-collector is the collector, a request for information as to whether there are any delinquent taxes owed by the person to that school district or municipality.  The county assessor-collector shall specify the date by which the collector must respond to the request.
    
    (e)  If the county assessor-collector determines that there are delinquent taxes owed to the county, the county assessor-collector shall include in the statement issued under Subsection (c) the amount of delinquent taxes owed by the person to that county.  If the county assessor-collector is the collector for a school district or municipality having territory in the county and the county assessor-collector determines that there are delinquent ad valorem taxes owed by the person to the school district or municipality, the assessor-collector shall include in the statement issued under Subsection (c) the amount of delinquent taxes owed by the person to that school district or municipality.
    
    (f)  If the county assessor-collector receives a response from the collector for a school district or municipality having territory in the county indicating that there are delinquent taxes owed to that school district or municipality on the person's current or former property for which the person is personally liable, the county assessor-collector shall include in the statement issued under Subsection (c):
    
    (1)  the amount of delinquent taxes owed by the person to that school district or municipality;  and
    
    (2)  the name and address of the collector for that school district or municipality.

    Sec. 34.04.  CLAIMS FOR EXCESS PROCEEDS.  (a)  A person, including a taxing unit and the Title IV-D agency, may file a petition in the court that ordered the seizure or sale setting forth a claim to the excess proceeds.  The petition must be filed before the second anniversary of the date of the sale of the property.  The petition is not required to be filed as an original suit separate from the underlying suit for seizure of the property or foreclosure of a tax lien on the property but may be filed under the cause number of the underlying suit.
    
    (b)  A copy of the petition shall be served, in the manner prescribed by Rule 21a, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, or that rule's successor, on all parties to the underlying action not later than the 20th day before the date set for a hearing on the petition.
    
    (c)  At the hearing the court shall order that the proceeds be paid according to the following priorities to each party that establishes its claim to the proceeds:
    
    (1)  to the tax sale purchaser if the tax sale has been adjudged to be void and the purchaser has prevailed in an action against the taxing units under Section [34.07](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=34.07)(d) by final judgment;

    (4)  to a taxing unit for any unpaid taxes, penalties, interest, or other amounts adjudged due under the judgment that were not satisfied from the proceeds from the tax sale;  and

    (c-1)  Except as provided by Subsections (c)(5)(B) and (C), a former owner of the property that acquired an interest in the property after the date of the judgment may not establish a claim to the proceeds.  For purposes of this subsection, a former owner of the property is considered to have acquired an interest in the property after the date of the judgment if the deed by which the former owner acquired the interest was recorded in the real property records of the county in which the property is located after the date of the judgment.
    
    (d)  Interest or costs may not be allowed under this section.
    
    (e)  An order under this section directing that all or part of the excess proceeds be paid to a party is appealable.

    (5)  the assignment or transfer document contains a sworn statement by the assignor or transferor affirming:
    
    (A)  that the assignment or transfer was given voluntarily;
    
    (B)  the date on which the assignment or transfer was made and that the date was not earlier than the 36th day after the date the excess proceeds were deposited in the registry of the court;
    
    (C)  that the assignor or transferor has received the notice from the clerk required by Section [34.03](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=34.03);
    
    (D)  the nature and specific amount of consideration given for the assignment or transfer;
    
    (E)  the circumstances under which the excess proceeds are in the registry of the court;
    
    (F)  the amount of the claim to excess proceeds in the registry of the court;

    (I)  that the consideration was paid in full on the date of the assignment or transfer and that the consideration paid was an amount equal to at least 80 percent of the amount of the assignor's or transferor's claim to the excess proceeds.
    
    (g)  An assignee or transferee who obtains excess proceeds without complying with Subsection (f) is liable to the assignor or transferor for the amount of excess proceeds obtained plus attorney's fees and expenses.  An assignee or transferee who attempts to obtain excess proceeds without complying with Subsection (f) is liable to the assignor or transferor for attorney's fees and expenses.
    
    (h)  An assignee or transferee who files a petition setting forth a claim to excess proceeds must attach a copy of the assignment or transfer document and produce the original of the assignment or transfer document in court at the hearing on the petition.  If the original assignment or transfer document is lost, the assignee or transferee must obtain the presence of the assignor or transferor to testify at the hearing.  In addition, the assignee or transferee must produce at the hearing the original of any evidence verifying the payment of the consideration given for the assignment or transfer.  If the original of any evidence of the payment is lost or if the payment was in cash, the assignee or transferee must obtain the presence of the assignor or transferor to testify at the hearing.
    
    (i)  A fee charged by an attorney to obtain excess proceeds for an owner may not be greater than 25 percent of the amount obtained or $1,000, whichever is less.  A person who is not an attorney may not charge a fee to obtain excess proceeds for an owner.
    
    (j)  The amount of the excess proceeds the court may order be paid to an assignee or transferee may not exceed 125 percent of the amount the assignee or transferee paid the assignor or transferor on the date of the assignment or transfer.

    Sec. 34.05.  RESALE BY TAXING UNIT.  (a)  If property is sold to a taxing unit that is a party to the judgment, the taxing unit may sell the property at any time by public or private sale.  In selling the property, the taxing unit may, but is not required to, use the procedures provided by Section [263.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=263.001), Local Government Code, or Section [272.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=272.001), Local Government Code.  The sale is subject to any right of redemption of the former owner.  The redemption period begins on the date the deed to the taxing unit is filed for record.
    
    (b)  Property sold pursuant to Subsections (c) and (d) of this section may be sold for any amount. This subsection does not authorize a sale of property in violation of Section [52](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=3.52), Article III, Texas Constitution.
    
    (c)  The taxing unit purchasing the property by resolution of its governing body may request the sheriff or a constable to sell the property at a public sale.  If the purchasing taxing unit has not sold the property within six months after the date on which the owner's right of redemption terminates, any taxing unit that is entitled to receive proceeds of the sale by resolution of its governing body may request the sheriff or a constable in writing to sell the property at a public sale.  On receipt of a request made under this subsection, the sheriff or constable shall sell the property as provided by Subsection (d), unless the property is sold under Subsection (h) or (i) before the date set for the public sale.
    
    (d)  Except as provided by this subsection, all public sales requested as provided by Subsection (c) must be conducted in the manner prescribed by the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure for the sale of property under execution or, if directed by the commissioners court of the county, in accordance with Section [34.01](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=34.01)(a-1) and the rules adopted under that section providing for public auction using online bidding and sale. The notice of the sale must contain a description of the property to be sold, the number and style of the suit under which the property was sold at the tax foreclosure sale, and the date of the tax foreclosure sale. The description of the property in the notice is sufficient if it is stated in the manner provided by Section [34.01](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=34.01)(f). If the commissioners court of a county by order specifies the date or time at which or location in the county where a public sale requested under Subsection (c) shall be conducted, the sale shall be conducted on the date and at the time and location specified in the order. The acceptance of a bid by the officer conducting the sale is conclusive and binding on the question of its sufficiency. An action to set aside the sale on the grounds that the bid is insufficient may not be sustained in court, except that a taxing unit that participates in distribution of proceeds of the sale may file an action before the first anniversary of the date of the sale to set aside the sale on the grounds of fraud or collusion between the officer making the sale and the purchaser. On conclusion of the sale, the officer making the sale shall prepare a deed to the purchaser. The taxing unit that requested the sale may elect to prepare a deed for execution by the officer. If the taxing unit prepares the deed, the officer shall execute that deed. An officer who executes a deed prepared by the taxing unit is not responsible or liable for any inconsistency, error, or other defect in the form of the deed. As soon as practicable after a deed is executed by the officer, the officer shall either file the deed for recording with the county clerk or deliver the executed deed to the taxing unit that requested the sale, which shall file the deed for recording with the county clerk. The county clerk shall file and record each deed under this subsection and after recording shall return the deed to the grantee.
    
    (e)  The presiding officer of a taxing unit selling real property under Subsection (h) or (i), under Section [34.051](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=34.051), or under Section [253.010](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=253.010), Local Government Code, or the sheriff or constable selling real property under Subsections (c) and (d) shall execute a deed to the property conveying to the purchaser the right, title, and interest acquired or held by each taxing unit that was a party to the judgment foreclosing tax liens on the property.  The conveyance shall be made subject to any remaining right of redemption at the time of the sale.
    
    (f)  An action attacking the validity of a resale of property pursuant to this section may not be instituted after the expiration of one year after the date of the resale.
    
    (g)  A taxing unit to which property is bid off may recover its costs of upkeep, maintenance, and environmental cleanup from the resale proceeds without further court order.
    
    (h)  In lieu of a sale pursuant to Subsections (c) and (d) of this section, the taxing unit that purchased the property may sell the property at a private sale.  Consent of each taxing unit entitled to receive proceeds of the sale under the judgment is not required.  Property sold under this subsection may not be sold for an amount that is less than the lesser of:
    
    (1)  the market value specified in the judgment of foreclosure;  or
    
    (2)  the total amount of the judgments against the property.
    
    (i)  In lieu of a sale pursuant to Subsections (c) and (d) of this section, the taxing unit that purchased the property may sell the property at a private sale for an amount less than required under Subsection (h) of this section with the consent of each taxing unit entitled to receive proceeds of the sale under the judgment.  This subsection does not authorize a sale of property in violation of Section [52](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=3.52), Article III, Texas Constitution.
    
    (j)  In lieu of a sale pursuant to Subsections (c) and (d), the taxing unit that purchased the property may sell the property at a private sale for an amount equal to or greater than its market value, as shown by the most recent certified appraisal roll, if:
    
    (1)  the sum of the amount of the judgment plus post-judgment taxes, penalties, and interest owing against the property exceeds the market value; and
    
    (2)  each taxing unit entitled to receive proceeds of the sale consents to the sale for that amount.
    
    (k)  A sale under Subsection (j) discharges and extinguishes all liens foreclosed by the judgment and, with the exception of the prorated tax for the current year that is assessed under Section [26.10](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.10), the liens for post-judgment taxes that accrued from the date of judgment until the date the taxing unit purchased the property. The presiding officer of a taxing unit selling real property under Subsection (j) shall execute a deed to the property conveying to the purchaser the right, title, and interest acquired or held by each taxing unit that was a party to the judgment foreclosing tax liens on the property. The conveyance is subject to any remaining right of redemption at the time of the sale and to the purchaser's obligation to pay the prorated taxes for the current year as provided by Section [26.10](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.10). The deed must recite that the liens foreclosed by the judgment and the post-judgment tax liens are discharged and extinguished by virtue of the conveyance.
    
    (l)  A taxing unit that does not consent to a sale under Subsection (j) is liable to the taxing unit that purchased the property for a pro rata share of the costs incurred by the purchasing unit in maintaining the property, including the costs of preventing the property from becoming a public nuisance, a danger to the public, or a threat to the public health. The nonconsenting unit's share of the costs described by this subsection is calculated from the date the unit fails to consent to the sale and is equal to the percentage of the proceeds from a sale of the property to which the nonconsenting unit would be entitled multiplied by the costs incurred by the purchasing unit to maintain the property.

    (5)  a provision that all properties are sold subject to any right of redemption.
    
    (c)  The deed of conveyance of property sold under this section conveys to the purchaser the right, title, and interest acquired or held by each taxing unit that was a party to the judgment of foreclosure, subject to any remaining right of redemption at the time of the sale.
    
    (d)  An action attacking the validity of a sale of property pursuant to this section may not be instituted after the expiration of one year after the date of the sale and then only after the unconditional tender into the registry of the court of an amount equal to all taxes, penalties, interest, costs, and post-judgment interest of all judgments on which the original foreclosure sale was based.

    Sec. 34.07.  SUBROGATION OF PURCHASER AT VOID SALE.  (a)  The purchaser at a void or defective tax sale or tax resale is subrogated to the rights of the taxing unit in whose behalf the property was sold or resold to the same extent a purchaser at a void or defective sale conducted in behalf of a judgment creditor is subrogated to the rights of the judgment creditor.
    
    (b)  Except as provided by Subsection (c), the purchaser at a void or defective tax sale or tax resale is subrogated to the tax lien of the taxing unit in whose behalf the property was sold or resold to the same extent a purchaser at a void or defective mortgage or other lien foreclosure sale is subrogated to the lien of the lienholder, and the purchaser is entitled to a reforeclosure of the lien to which the purchaser is subrogated.
    
    (c)  If the purchaser at a void or defective tax sale or tax resale paid less than the total amount of the judgment against the property, the purchaser is subrogated to the tax lien only in the amount the purchaser paid at the sale or resale.
    
    (d)  In lieu of pursuing the subrogation rights provided by this section to which a purchaser is subrogated, a purchaser at a void tax sale or tax resale may elect to file an action against the taxing units to which proceeds of the sale were distributed to recover an amount from each taxing unit equal to the distribution of taxes, penalties, interest, and attorney's fees the taxing unit received.  In a suit filed under this subsection, the purchaser may include a claim for, and is entitled to recover, any excess proceeds of the sale that remain on deposit in the registry of the court or, in the alternative, is entitled to have judgment against any party to whom the excess proceeds have been distributed.  A purchaser who files a suit authorized by this subsection waives all rights of subrogation otherwise provided by this section.  This subsection applies only to an original purchaser at a tax sale or resale and only if that purchaser has not subsequently sold the property to another person.
    
    (e)  If the purchaser prevails in a suit filed under Subsection (d), the court shall expressly provide in its final judgment that:
    
    (1)  the tax sale is vacated and set aside;  and

The  purchaser may conclusively presume that the tax sale was valid and shall have full title to the property free and clear of the right, title, and interest of any person that arose before the tax sale, subject only to recorded restrictive covenants and valid easements of record set forth in Section [34.01](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=34.01)(n) and subject to applicable rights of redemption.
    
    (c)  If a person is not barred from bringing an action challenging the validity of a tax sale under Subsection (b) or any other provision of this title or applicable law, the person must bring an action no later than two years after the cause of action accrues to recover real property claimed by another who:

    (2)  the lesser of the amount of taxes, penalties, interest, and costs for which the warrant was issued or the market value of the property as specified in the warrant, plus the amount of the fee for filing the taxing unit's deed and the amount spent by the taxing unit as costs on the property, if the property was seized under Subchapter [E](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=33.91), Chapter [33](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=33), and bid off to the taxing unit under Section [34.01](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=34.01)(p).

    (d)  If the amount paid by the owner of the property under Subsection (c) is less than the amount of the judgment under which the property was sold, the owner shall pay to the taxing unit to which the property was bid off under Section [34.01](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=34.01) an amount equal to the difference between the amount paid under Subsection (c) and the amount of the judgment.  The taxing unit shall issue a receipt for a payment received under this subsection and shall distribute the amount received to each taxing unit that participated in the judgment and sale in an amount proportional to the unit's share of the total amount of the aggregate judgments of the participating taxing units.  The owner of the property shall deliver the receipt received from the taxing unit to the person from whom the property is redeemed.
    
    (e)  The owner of real property sold at a tax sale other than property that was used as the residence homestead of the owner or that was land designated for agricultural use when the suit or the application for the warrant was filed, or that is a mineral interest, may redeem the property in the same manner and by paying the same amounts as prescribed by Subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d), as applicable, except that:

    (f)  The owner of real property sold at a tax sale may redeem the real property by paying the required amount as prescribed by this section to the assessor-collector for the county in which the property was sold, if the owner of the real property makes an affidavit stating:
    
    (1)  that the period in which the owner's right of redemption must be exercised has not expired; and
    
    (2)  that the owner has made diligent search in the county in which the property is located for the purchaser at the tax sale or for the purchaser at resale, and has failed to find the purchaser, that the purchaser is not a resident of the county in which the property is located, that the owner and the purchaser cannot agree on the amount of redemption money due, or that the purchaser refuses to give the owner a quitclaim deed to the property.
    
    (f-1)  An assessor-collector who receives an affidavit and payment under Subsection (f) shall accept that the assertions set out in the affidavit are true and correct.  The assessor-collector receiving the payment shall give the owner a signed receipt witnessed by two persons.  The receipt, when recorded, is notice to all persons that the property described has been redeemed.  The assessor-collector shall on demand pay the money received by the assessor-collector to the purchaser. An assessor-collector is not liable to any person for performing the assessor-collector's duties under this subsection in reliance on the assertions contained in an affidavit.
    
    (g)  In this section:
    
    (1)  "Land designated for agricultural use" means land for which an application for appraisal under Subchapter [C](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=23.41) or D, Chapter [23](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=23), has been finally approved.
    
    (2)  "Costs" includes:
    
    (A)  the amount reasonably spent by the purchaser for maintaining, preserving, and safekeeping the property, including the cost of:
    
    (i)  property insurance;
    
    (ii)  repairs or improvements required by a local ordinance or building code or by a lease of the property in effect on the date of the sale;
    
    (iii)  discharging a lien imposed by a municipality to secure expenses incurred by the municipality in remedying a health or safety hazard on the property;
    
    (iv)  dues or assessments for maintenance paid to a property owners' association under a recorded restrictive covenant to which the property is subject;  and
    
    (v)  impact or standby fees imposed under the Local Government Code or Water Code and paid to a political subdivision;  and
    
    (B)  if the purchaser is a taxing unit to which the property is bid off under Section [34.01](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=34.01), personnel and overhead costs reasonably incurred by the purchaser in connection with maintaining, preserving, safekeeping, managing, and reselling the property.
    
    (3)  "Purchaser" includes a taxing unit to which property is bid off under Section [34.01](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=34.01).
    
    (4)  "Residence homestead" has the meaning assigned by Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13).
    
    (h)  The right of redemption does not grant or reserve in the former owner of the real property the right to the use or possession of the property, or to receive rents, income, or other benefits from the property while the right of redemption exists.
    
    (i)  The owner of property who is entitled to redeem the property under this section may request that the purchaser of the property, or the taxing unit to which the property was bid off, provide that owner a written itemization of all amounts spent by the purchaser or taxing unit in costs on the property.  The owner must make the request in writing and send the request to the purchaser at the address shown for the purchaser in the purchaser's deed for the property, or to the business address of the collector for the taxing unit, as applicable.  The purchaser or the collector shall itemize all amounts spent on the property in costs and deliver the itemization in writing to the owner not later than the 10th day after the date the written request is received.  Delivery of the itemization to the owner may be made by depositing the document in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the owner at the address provided in the owner's written request.  Only those amounts included in the itemization provided to the owner may be allowed as costs for purposes of redemption.
    
    (j)  A quitclaim deed to an owner redeeming property under this section is not notice of an unrecorded instrument.  The grantee of a quitclaim deed and a successor or assign of the grantee may be a bona fide purchaser in good faith for value under recording laws.
    
    (k)  The inclusion of dues and assessments for maintenance paid to a property owners' association within the definition of "costs" under Subsection (g) may not be construed as:
    
    (1)  a waiver of any immunity to which a taxing unit may be entitled from a suit or from liability for those dues or assessments;  or
    
    (2)  authority for a taxing unit to make an expenditure of public funds in violation of Section [50](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=3.50), [51](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=3.51), or [52](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=3.52)(a), Article III, or Section 3, Article XI, Texas Constitution.

    Sec. 34.22.  EVIDENCE OF TITLE TO REDEEM REAL PROPERTY.
