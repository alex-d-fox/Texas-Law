    (B)  "goods" includes the husbandry of animals, the growing and harvesting of crops, and the severance of timber from realty.
    
    (f)  A taxable entity may subtract as a cost of goods sold indirect or administrative overhead costs, including all mixed service costs, such as security services, legal services, data processing services, accounting services, personnel operations, and general financial planning and financial management costs, that it can demonstrate are allocable to the acquisition or production of goods, except that the amount subtracted may not exceed four percent of the taxable entity's total indirect or administrative overhead costs, including all mixed service costs.  Any costs excluded under Subsection (e) may not be subtracted under this subsection.
    
    (g)  A taxable entity that is allowed a subtraction by this section for a cost of goods sold and that is subject to Section 263A, 460, or 471, Internal Revenue Code, may capitalize that cost in the same manner and to the same extent that the taxable entity capitalized that cost on its federal income tax return or may expense those costs, except for costs excluded under Subsection (e), or in accordance with Subsections (c), (d), and (f).  If the taxable entity elects to capitalize costs, it must capitalize each cost allowed under this section that it capitalized on its federal income tax return.  If the taxable entity later elects to begin expensing a cost that may be allowed under this section as a cost of goods sold, the entity may not deduct any cost in ending inventory from a previous report.  If the taxable entity elects to expense a cost of goods sold that may be allowed under this section, a cost incurred before the first day of the period on which the report is based may not be subtracted as a cost of goods sold.  If the taxable entity elects to expense a cost of goods sold and later elects to capitalize that cost of goods sold, a cost expensed on a previous report may not be capitalized.
    
    (h)  A taxable entity shall determine its cost of goods sold, except as otherwise provided by this section, in accordance with the methods used on the federal income tax return on which the report under this chapter is based.  This subsection does not affect the type or category of cost of goods sold that may be subtracted under this section.
    
    (i)  A taxable entity may make a subtraction under this section in relation to the cost of goods sold only if that entity owns the goods.  The determination of whether a taxable entity is an owner is based on all of the facts and circumstances, including the various benefits and burdens of ownership vested with the taxable entity.  A taxable entity furnishing labor or materials to a project for the construction, improvement, remodeling, repair, or industrial maintenance (as the term "maintenance" is defined in 34 T.A.C. Section 3.357) of real property is considered to be an owner of that labor or materials and may include the costs, as allowed by this section, in the computation of cost of goods sold.  Solely for purposes of this section, a taxable entity shall be treated as the owner of goods being manufactured or produced by the entity under a contract with the federal government, including any subcontracts that support a contract with the federal government, notwithstanding that the Federal Acquisition Regulation may require that title or risk of loss with respect to those goods be transferred to the federal government before the manufacture or production of those goods is complete.
    
    (j)  A taxable entity may not make a subtraction under this section for cost of goods sold to the extent the cost of goods sold was funded by partner contributions and deducted under Subsection (c)(13).
    
    (k)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the taxable entity is a lending institution that offers loans to the public and elects to subtract cost of goods sold, the entity, other than an entity primarily engaged in an activity described by category 5932 of the 1987 Standard Industrial Classification Manual published by the federal Office of Management and Budget, may subtract as a cost of goods sold an amount equal to interest expense.  For purposes of this subsection, an entity engaged in lending to unrelated parties solely for agricultural production offers loans to the public.
    
    (k-1)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the following taxable entities may subtract as a cost of goods sold the costs otherwise allowed by this section in relation to tangible personal property that the entity rents or leases in the ordinary course of business of the entity:
    
    (1)  a motor vehicle rental or leasing company that remits a tax on gross receipts imposed under Section [152.026](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=152.026);
    
    (2)  a heavy construction equipment rental or leasing company; and
    
    (3)  a railcar rolling stock rental or leasing company.
    
    (k-2)  This subsection applies only to a pipeline entity: (1) that owns or leases and operates the pipeline by which the product is transported for others and only to that portion of the product to which the entity does not own title; and (2) that is primarily engaged in gathering, storing, transporting, or processing crude oil, including finished petroleum products, natural gas, condensate, and natural gas liquids, except for a refinery installation that manufactures finished petroleum products from crude oil. Notwithstanding Subsection (e)(3) or (i), a pipeline entity providing services for others related to the product that the pipeline does not own and to which this subsection applies may subtract as a cost of goods sold its depreciation, operations, and maintenance costs allowed by this section related to the services provided.
    
    (k-3)  For purposes of Subsection (k-2), "processing" means the physical or mechanical removal, separation, or treatment of crude oil, including finished petroleum products, natural gas, condensate, and natural gas liquids after those materials are produced from the earth.  The term does not include the chemical or biological transformation of those materials.
    
    (l)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a payment made by one member of an affiliated group to another member of that affiliated group not included in the combined group may be subtracted as a cost of goods sold only if it is a transaction made at arm's length.

    (b)  Subject to Subsection (c), a taxable entity may deduct from its apportioned margin relocation costs incurred in relocating the taxable entity's main office or other principal place of business to this state from another state if the taxable entity:
    
    (1)  did not do business in this state before relocating the taxable entity's main office or other principal place of business to this state;  and
    
    (2)  is not a member of an affiliated group engaged in a unitary business, another member of which is doing business in this state on the date the taxable entity relocates the taxable entity's main office or other principal place of business to this state.
    
    (c)  A taxable entity must take the deduction authorized by Subsection (b) on the report based on the taxable entity's initial period described by Section [171.151](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=171.151)(1).

    Sec. 171.111.  TEMPORARY CREDIT ON TAXABLE MARGIN.  (a)  On the first report originally due under this chapter on or after January 1, 2008, a taxable entity must notify the comptroller in writing of its intent to take a credit in an amount allowed by this section on the tax due on taxable margin.  The taxable entity may thereafter elect to claim the credit for the current year and future year at or before the original due date of any report due after January 1, 2008, until the taxable entity revokes the election or this section expires, whichever is earlier.  A taxable entity may claim the credit for not more than 20 consecutive privilege periods beginning with the first report originally due under this chapter on or after January 1, 2008.  A taxable entity may make only one election under this section and the election may not be conveyed, assigned, or transferred to another entity.
    
    (b)  The credit allowed under this section for any privilege period is computed by:
    
    (1)  determining the amount of the business loss carryforwards of the taxable entity under Section 171.110(e), as that section applied to annual reports originally due before January 1, 2008, that were not exhausted on a report originally due under this chapter before January 1, 2008;
    
    (2)   multiplying the amount determined under Subdivision (1)  by:
    
    (A)  2.25 percent for reports originally due on or after January 1, 2008, and before January 1, 2018; and
    
    (B)  7.75 percent for reports originally due on or after January 1, 2018, and before September 1, 2027; and
    
    (3)  multiplying the amount determined under Subdivision (2) by 4.5 percent.
    
    (c)   The comptroller may request that the taxable entity submit, with each annual report in which the taxable entity is eligible to take a credit, information relating to the amount determined under Subsection (b)(1).  The taxable entity shall submit in the form and content the comptroller requires any information relating to the amount determined under Subsection (b)(1) or any other matter relevant to the computation of the credit for which the taxable entity is eligible.
    
    (d)  A credit that a taxable entity is entitled to under this section may not be conveyed, assigned, or transferred.  A taxable entity loses the right to claim the credit if the entity changes combined groups after June 30, 2007.
    
    (d-1)  A taxable entity, other than a combined group, may not claim the credit under this section unless the taxable entity was, on May 1, 2006, subject to the tax imposed by this chapter as this chapter existed on that date.  A taxable entity that is a combined group may claim the credit for each member entity that was, on May 1, 2006, subject to the tax imposed by this chapter as this chapter existed on that date and shall compute the amount of the credit for that member as provided by this section.
    
    (d-2)  The amount of credit claimed, including any unused credit carried forward, may not exceed the amount of franchise tax due for the report.  Unused credits may not be carried forward to reports originally due on or after September 1, 2027.
    
    (e)  This section expires September 1, 2027.

    (b)  Except as otherwise provided by this section, a taxable entity shall use the same accounting methods to apportion margin as used in computing margin.
    
    (c)  A taxable entity may not change its accounting methods used to calculate gross receipts more often than once every four years without the express written consent of the comptroller.
