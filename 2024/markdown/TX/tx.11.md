    (1)  the property is leased for compensation to a private business enterprise as provided in this subsection;  or
    
    (2)  the transfer of the property to an institution is contested in a probate court, in which case ad valorem taxes shall be assessed to the estate of the decedent until the final determination of the disposition of the property is made.  The property is exempt from the assessment of ad valorem taxes upon vesting of the property in the institution.
    
    (f)  Property of a higher education development foundation or an alumni association that is located on land owned by the state for the support, maintenance, or benefit of an institution of higher education as defined in Chapter [61](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=61), Education Code, is exempt from taxation if:

    (h)  For purposes of this section, tangible personal property is owned by this state or a political subdivision of this state if it is subject to a lease-purchase agreement providing that the state or political subdivision, as applicable, is entitled to compel delivery of the legal title to the property to the state or political subdivision, as applicable, at the end of the lease term.  The property ceases to be owned by the state or political subdivision, as applicable, if, not later than the 30th day after the date the lease terminates, the state or political subdivision, as applicable, does not exercise its right to acquire legal title to the property.
    
    (i)  A corporation organized under the Texas Non-Profit Corporation Act (Article 1396-1.01 et seq., Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes), or a successor statute, that engages primarily in providing chilled water and steam to an eligible institution, as defined by Section [301.031](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=301.031), Health and Safety Code, is entitled to an exemption from taxation of the property the corporation owns as though the property of the corporation were owned by this state and used for health or educational purposes.

(a)  A family or single adult is entitled to an exemption from taxation for the county purposes authorized in Article VIII, Section [1-a](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=8.1-a), of the Texas Constitution of $3,000 of the assessed value of his residence homestead.
    
    (b)  An adult is entitled to exemption from taxation by a school district of $100,000 of the appraised value of the adult's residence homestead, except that only $5,000 of the exemption applies to an entity operating under former Chapter 17, [18](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=18), [25](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=25), [26](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=26), [27](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=27), or [28](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=28), Education Code, as those chapters existed on May 1, 1995, as permitted by Section [11.301](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=11.301), Education Code.
    
    (c)  In addition to the exemption provided by Subsection (b) of this section, an adult who is disabled or is 65 or older is entitled to an exemption from taxation by a school district of $10,000 of the appraised value of his residence homestead.
    
    (d)  In addition to the exemptions provided by Subsections (b) and (c) of this section, an individual who is disabled or is 65 or older is entitled to an exemption from taxation by a taxing unit of a portion (the amount of which is fixed as provided by Subsection (e) of this section) of the appraised value of his residence homestead if the exemption is adopted either:
    
    (1)  by the governing body of the taxing unit;  or
    
    (2)  by a favorable vote of a majority of the qualified voters of the taxing unit at an election called by the governing body of a taxing unit, and the governing body shall call the election on the petition of at least 20 percent of the number of qualified voters who voted in the preceding election of the taxing unit.
    
    (e)  The amount of an exemption adopted as provided by Subsection (d) of this section is $3,000 of the appraised value of the residence homestead unless a larger amount is specified by:
    
    (1)  the governing body authorizing the exemption if the exemption is authorized as provided by Subdivision (1) of Subsection (d) of this section;  or
    
    (2)  the petition for the election if the exemption is authorized as provided by Subdivision (2) of Subsection (d) of this section.
    
    (f)  Once authorized, an exemption adopted as provided by Subsection (d) of this section may be repealed or decreased or increased in amount by the governing body of the taxing unit or by the procedure authorized by Subdivision (2) of Subsection (d) of this section.  In the case of a decrease, the amount of the exemption may not be reduced to less than $3,000 of the market value.
    
    (g)  If the residence homestead exemption provided by Subsection (d) of this section is adopted by a county that levies a tax for the county purposes authorized by Article VIII, Section [1-a](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=8.1-a), of the Texas Constitution, the residence homestead exemptions provided by Subsections (a) and (d) of this section may not be aggregated for the county tax purposes.  An individual who is eligible for both exemptions is entitled to take only the exemption authorized as provided by Subsection (d) of this section for purposes of that county tax.
    
    (h)  Joint, community, or successive owners may not each receive the same exemption provided by or pursuant to this section for the same residence homestead in the same year.  An eligible disabled person who is 65 or older may not receive both a disabled and an elderly residence homestead exemption from the same taxing unit in the same year but may choose either if a taxing unit has adopted both.  An eligible disabled person who is 65 or older may receive both a disabled and an elderly residence homestead exemption in the same year if the person receives the exemptions with respect to taxes levied by different taxing units.  A person may not receive an exemption under this section for more than one residence homestead in the same year.  An heir property owner who qualifies heir property as the owner's residence homestead under this chapter is considered the sole recipient of any exemption granted to the owner for the residence homestead by or pursuant to this section.
    
    (i)  The assessor and collector for a taxing unit may disregard the exemptions authorized by Subsection (b), (c), (d), or (n) of this section and assess and collect a tax pledged for payment of debt without deducting the amount of the exemption if:
    
    (1)  prior to adoption of the exemption, the unit pledged the taxes for the payment of a debt;  and
    
    (2)  granting the exemption would impair the obligation of the contract creating the debt.
    
    (j)  For purposes of this section:
    
    (1)  "Residence homestead" means a structure (including a mobile home) or a separately secured and occupied portion of a structure (together with the land, not to exceed 20 acres, and improvements used in the residential occupancy of the structure, if the structure and the land and improvements have identical ownership) that:
    
    (A)  is owned by one or more individuals, either directly or through a beneficial interest in a qualifying trust;
    
    (B)  is designed or adapted for human residence;
    
    (C)  is used as a residence; and
    
    (D)  is occupied as the individual's principal residence by an owner, by an owner's surviving spouse who has a life estate in the property, or, for property owned through a beneficial interest in a qualifying trust, by a trustor or beneficiary of the trust who qualifies for the exemption.
    
    (2)  "Trustor" means a person who transfers an interest in real or personal property to a qualifying trust, whether during the person's lifetime or at death, or the person's spouse.
    
    (3)  "Qualifying trust" means a trust:
    
    (A)  in which the agreement, will, or court order creating the trust, an instrument transferring property to the trust, or any other agreement that is binding on the trustee provides that the trustor of the trust or a beneficiary of the trust has the right to use and occupy as the trustor's or beneficiary's principal residence residential property rent free and without charge except for taxes and other costs and expenses specified in the instrument or court order:
    
    (i)  for life;
    
    (ii)  for the lesser of life or a term of years; or
    
    (iii)  until the date the trust is revoked or terminated by an instrument or court order that describes the property with sufficient certainty to identify it and is recorded in the real property records of the county in which the property is located; and
    
    (B)  that acquires the property in an instrument of title or under a court order that:
    
    (i)  describes the property with sufficient certainty to identify it and the interest acquired; and
    
    (ii)  is recorded in the real property records of the county in which the property is located.
    
    (k)  A qualified residential structure does not lose its character as a residence homestead if a portion of the structure is rented to another or is used primarily for other purposes that are incompatible with the owner's residential use of the structure.  However, the amount of any residence homestead exemption does not apply to the value of that portion of the structure that is used primarily for purposes that are incompatible with the owner's residential use.
    
    (l)  A qualified residential structure does not lose its character as a residence homestead when the owner who qualifies for the exemption temporarily stops occupying it as a principal residence if that owner does not establish a different principal residence and the absence is:
    
    (1)  for a period of less than two years and the owner intends to return and occupy the structure as the owner's principal residence; or
    
    (2)  caused by the owner's:
    
    (A)  military service inside or outside of the United States as a member of the armed forces of the United States or of this state; or
    
    (B)  residency in a facility that provides services related to health, infirmity, or aging.
    
    (m)  In this section:
    
    (1)  "Disabled" means under a disability for purposes of payment of disability insurance benefits under Federal Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance.
    
    (2)  "School district" means a political subdivision organized to provide general elementary and secondary public education.  "School district" does not include a junior college district or a political subdivision organized to provide special education services.
    
    (n)  In addition to any other exemptions provided by this section, an individual is entitled to an exemption from taxation by a taxing unit of a percentage of the appraised value of his residence homestead if the exemption is adopted by the governing body of the taxing unit before July 1 in the manner provided by law for official action by the body.  If the percentage set by the taxing unit produces an exemption in a tax year of less than $5,000 when applied to a particular residence homestead, the individual is entitled to an exemption of $5,000 of the appraised value.  The percentage adopted by the taxing unit may not exceed 20 percent.
    
    (n-1)  The governing body of a school district, municipality, or county that adopted an exemption under Subsection (n) for the 2022 tax year may not reduce the amount of or repeal the exemption.  This subsection expires December 31, 2027.
    
    (o)  For purposes of this section, a residence homestead also may consist of an interest in real property created through ownership of stock in a corporation incorporated under the Cooperative Association Act (Article 1396-50.01, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes) to provide dwelling places to its stockholders if:
    
    (1)  the interests of the stockholders of the corporation are appraised separately as provided by Section [23.19](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=23.19) of this code in the tax year to which the exemption applies;
    
    (2)  ownership of the stock entitles the owner to occupy a dwelling place owned by the corporation;
    
    (3)  the dwelling place is a structure or a separately secured and occupied portion of a structure;  and
    
    (4)  the dwelling place is occupied as his principal residence by a stockholder who qualifies for the exemption.
    
    (p)  Exemption under this section for a homestead described by Subsection (o) of this section extends only to the dwelling place occupied as a residence homestead and to a portion of the total common area used in the residential occupancy that is equal to the percentage of the total amount of the stock issued by the corporation that is owned by the homestead claimant.  The size of a residence homestead under Subsection (o) of this section, including any relevant portion of common area, may not exceed 20 acres.
    
    (q)  The surviving spouse of an individual who qualifies for an exemption under Subsection (d) for the residence homestead of a person 65 or older is entitled to an exemption for the same property from the same taxing unit in an amount equal to that of the exemption for which the deceased spouse qualified if:
    
    (1)  the deceased spouse died in a year in which the deceased spouse qualified for the exemption;
    
    (2)  the surviving spouse was 55 or older when the deceased spouse died;  and
    
    (3)  the property was the residence homestead of the surviving spouse when the deceased spouse died and remains the residence homestead of the surviving spouse.
    
    (r)  An individual who receives an exemption under Subsection (d) is not entitled to an exemption under Subsection (q).

    Sec. 11.135.  CONTINUATION OF RESIDENCE HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION WHILE REPLACEMENT STRUCTURE IS CONSTRUCTED; SALE OF PROPERTY.  (a)  If a qualified residential structure for which the owner receives an exemption under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13) is rendered uninhabitable or unusable by a casualty or by wind or water damage, the owner may continue to receive the exemption for the structure and the land and improvements used in the residential occupancy of the structure while the owner constructs a replacement qualified residential structure on the land if the owner does not establish a different principal residence for which the owner receives an exemption under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13) during that period and intends to return and occupy the structure as the owner's principal residence.  To continue to receive the exemption, the owner must begin active construction of the replacement qualified residential structure or other physical preparation of the site on which the structure is to be located not later than the first anniversary, or the fifth anniversary for a property described by Subsection (a-1)(1), of the date the owner ceases to occupy the former qualified residential structure as the owner's principal residence.
    
    (a-1)  An owner may not receive an exemption under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13) for property under the circumstances described by Subsection (a) for more than:

    (B)  the residential structure located on the property is rendered uninhabitable or unusable as a result of the disaster; or
    
    (2)  two years if Subdivision (1) does not apply.
    
    (b)  For purposes of Subsection (a), the site of a replacement qualified residential structure is under physical preparation if the owner has engaged in architectural or engineering work, soil testing, land clearing activities, or site improvement work necessary for the construction of the structure or has conducted an environmental or land use study relating to the construction of the structure.
    
    (c)  If an owner receives an exemption for property under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13) under the circumstances described by Subsection (a) and sells the property before the owner completes construction of a replacement qualified residential structure on the property, an additional tax is imposed on the property equal to the difference between the taxes imposed on the property for each of the years in which the owner received the exemption and the tax that would have been imposed had the owner not received the exemption in each of those years, plus interest at an annual rate of seven percent calculated from the dates on which the differences would have become due.
    
    (d)  A tax lien attaches to property on the date a sale under the circumstances described by Subsection (c) occurs to secure payment of the additional tax and interest imposed by that subsection and any penalties incurred.  The lien exists in favor of all taxing units for which the additional tax is imposed.
    
    (e)  A determination that a sale of property under the circumstances described by Subsection (c) has occurred is made by the chief appraiser.  The chief appraiser shall deliver a notice of the determination to the owner of the property as soon as possible after making the determination and shall include in the notice an explanation of the owner's right to protest the determination.  If the owner does not file a timely protest or if the final determination of the protest is that the additional taxes are due, the assessor for each taxing unit shall prepare and deliver a bill for the additional taxes plus interest as soon as practicable.  The taxes and interest are due and become delinquent and incur penalties and interest as provided by law for ad valorem taxes imposed by the taxing unit if not paid before the next February 1 that is at least 20 days after the date the bill is delivered to the owner of the property.
    
    (f)  The sanctions provided by Subsection (c) do not apply if the sale is:
    
    (1)  for right-of-way; or
    
    (2)  to this state or a political subdivision of this state to be used for a public purpose.
    
    (g)  The comptroller shall adopt rules and forms to implement this section.

    Sec. 11.1801.  CHARITY CARE AND COMMUNITY BENEFITS REQUIREMENTS FOR CHARITABLE HOSPITAL.  (a)  To qualify as a charitable organization under Section [11.18](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.18)(d)(1), a nonprofit hospital or hospital system must provide charity care and community benefits as follows:
    
    (1)  charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care must be provided at a level that is reasonable in relation to the community needs, as determined through the community needs assessment, the available resources of the hospital or hospital system, and the tax-exempt benefits received by the hospital or hospital system;
    
    (2)  charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care must be provided in an amount equal to at least four percent of the hospital's or hospital system's net patient revenue;
    
    (3)  charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care must be provided in an amount equal to at least 100 percent of the hospital's or hospital system's tax-exempt benefits, excluding federal income tax;  or
    
    (4)  charity care and community benefits must be provided in a combined amount equal to at least five percent of the hospital's or hospital system's net patient revenue, provided that charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care are provided in an amount equal to at least four percent of net patient revenue.
    
    (b)  A nonprofit hospital that has been designated as a disproportionate share hospital under the state Medicaid program in the current year or in either of the previous two fiscal years shall be considered to have provided a reasonable amount of charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care and is considered to be in compliance with the standards in Subsection (a).
    
    (c)  A hospital operated on a nonprofit basis that is located in a county with a population of less than 58,000 and in which the entire county or the population of the entire county has been designated as a health professionals shortage area is considered to be in compliance with the standards in Subsection (a).
    
    (d)  A hospital providing health care services to inpatients or outpatients without receiving any payment for providing those services from any source, including the patient or person legally obligated to support the patient, third-party payors, Medicare, Medicaid, or any other state or local indigent care program but excluding charitable donations, legacies, bequests, or grants or payments for research, is considered to be in compliance with the standards in Subsection (a).
    
    (e)  For purposes of complying with Subsection (a)(4), a hospital or hospital system may not change its existing fiscal year unless the hospital or hospital system changes its ownership or corporate structure as a result of a sale or merger.
    
    (f)  For purposes of this section, a hospital that complies with Subsection (a)(1) or that is considered to be in compliance with the standards in Subsection (a) under Subsection (b), (c), or (d) shall be excluded in determining a hospital system's compliance with the standards in Subsection (a)(2), (3), or (4).
    
    (g)  For purposes of this section, "charity care," "government-sponsored indigent health care," "health care organization," "hospital system," "net patient revenue," "nonprofit hospital," and "tax-exempt benefits" have the meanings assigned by Sections [311.031](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=311.031) and [311.042](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=311.042), Health and Safety Code.  A determination of the amount of community benefits and charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care provided by a hospital or hospital system and the hospital's or hospital system's compliance with Section [311.045](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=311.045), Health and Safety Code, shall be based on the most recently completed and audited prior fiscal year of the hospital or hospital system.
    
    (h)  The providing of charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care in accordance with Subsection (a)(1) shall be guided by the prudent business judgment of the hospital, which will ultimately determine the appropriate level of charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care based on the community needs, the available resources of the hospital, the tax-exempt benefits received by the hospital, and other factors that may be unique to the hospital, such as the hospital's volume of Medicare and Medicaid patients.  These criteria shall not be determinative factors, but shall be guidelines contributing to the hospital's decision along with other factors that may be unique to the hospital.  The formulas in Subsections (a)(2), (3), and (4) shall also not be considered determinative of a reasonable amount of charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care.
    
    (i)  The requirements of this section shall not apply to the extent a hospital or hospital system demonstrates that reductions in the amount of community benefits, charity care, and government-sponsored indigent health care are necessary to maintain financial reserves at a level required by a bond covenant or are necessary to prevent the hospital or hospital system from endangering its ability to continue operations, or if the hospital or hospital system, as a result of a natural or other disaster, is required substantially to curtail its operations.
    
    (j)  In any fiscal year that a hospital or hospital system, through unintended miscalculation, fails to meet any of the standards in Subsection (a) or fails to be considered to be in compliance with the standards in Subsection (a) under Subsection (b), (c), or (d), the hospital or hospital system shall not lose its tax-exempt status without the opportunity to cure the miscalculation in the fiscal year following the fiscal year the failure is discovered by both meeting one of the standards and providing an additional amount of charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care that is equal to the shortfall from the previous fiscal year.  A hospital or hospital system may apply this provision only once every five years.

    Sec. 11.181.  CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS IMPROVING PROPERTY FOR LOW-INCOME HOUSING.  (a)  An organization is entitled to an exemption from taxation of improved or unimproved real property it owns if the organization:
    
    (1)  meets the requirements of a charitable organization provided by Sections [11.18](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.18)(e) and (f);
    
    (2)  owns the property for the purpose of building or repairing housing on the property primarily with volunteer labor to sell without profit to an individual or family satisfying the organization's low-income and other eligibility requirements;  and
    
    (3)  engages exclusively in the building, repair, and sale of housing as described by Subdivision (2), and related activities.
    
    (b)  Property may not be exempted under Subsection (a) after the fifth anniversary of the date the organization acquires the property.  Property that received an exemption under Section [11.1825](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.1825) and that was subsequently transferred by the organization described by that section that qualified for the exemption to an organization described by this section may not be exempted under Subsection (a) after the fifth anniversary of the date the transferring organization acquired the property.
    
    (c)  An organization entitled to an exemption under Subsection (a) is also entitled to an exemption from taxation of any building or tangible personal property the organization owns and uses in the administration of its acquisition, building, repair, or sale of property.  To qualify for an exemption under this subsection, property must be used exclusively by the charitable organization, except that another individual or organization may use the property for activities incidental to the charitable organization's use that benefit the beneficiaries of the charitable organization.
    
    (d)  For the purposes of Subsection (e), the chief appraiser shall determine the market value of property exempted under Subsection (a) and shall record the market value in the appraisal records.
    
    (e)  If the organization that owns improved or unimproved real property that has been exempted under Subsection (a) sells the property to a person other than an individual or family satisfying the organization's low-income or other eligibility requirements, a penalty is imposed on the property equal to the amount of the taxes that would have been imposed on the property in each tax year that the property was exempted from taxation under Subsection (a), plus interest at an annual rate of 12 percent calculated from the dates on which the taxes would have become due.
    
    (f)  The charitable organization and the purchaser of the property from that organization are jointly and severally liable for the penalty and interest imposed under Subsection (e).  A tax lien in favor of all taxing units for which the penalty is imposed attaches to the property to secure payment of the penalty and interest.
    
    (g)  The chief appraiser shall make an entry in the appraisal records for the property against which a penalty under Subsection (e) is imposed and shall deliver written notice of the imposition of the penalty and interest to the charitable organization and to the person who purchased the property from that organization.

    (2)  "Community housing development organization" has the meaning assigned by 42 U.S.C. Section 12704.
    
    (b)  An organization is entitled to an exemption from taxation of improved or unimproved real property it owns if the organization:
    
    (1)  is organized as a community housing development organization;
    
    (2)  meets the requirements of a charitable organization provided by Sections [11.18](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.18)(e) and (f);

    (4)  engages exclusively in the building, repair, and sale or rental of housing as described by Subdivision (3) and related activities.
    
    (c)  Property owned by the organization may not be exempted under Subsection (b) after the third anniversary of the date the organization acquires the property unless the organization is offering to rent or is renting the property without profit to a low-income or moderate-income individual or family satisfying the organization's eligibility requirements.
    
    (d)  A multifamily rental property consisting of 36 or more dwelling units owned by the organization that is exempted under Subsection (b) may not be exempted in a subsequent tax year unless in the preceding tax year the organization spent, for eligible persons in the county in which the property is located, an amount equal to at least 40 percent of the total amount of taxes that would have been imposed on the property in that year without the exemption on social, educational, or economic development services, capital improvement projects, or rent reduction.  This subsection does not apply to property acquired by the organization using tax-exempt bond financing after January 1, 1997, and before December 31, 2001.
    
    (e)  In addition to meeting the applicable requirements of Subsections (b) and (c), to receive an exemption under Subsection (b) for improved real property that includes a housing project constructed after December 31, 2001, and financed with qualified 501(c)(3) bonds issued under Section 145 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, tax-exempt private activity bonds subject to volume cap, or low-income housing tax credits, the organization must:
    
    (1)  control 100 percent of the interest in the general partner if the project is owned by a limited partnership;
    
    (2)  comply with all rules of and laws administered by the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs applicable to community housing development organizations;  and
    
    (3)  submit annually to the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs and to the governing body of each taxing unit for which the project receives an exemption for the housing project evidence demonstrating that the organization spent an amount equal to at least 90 percent of the project's cash flow in the preceding fiscal year as determined by the audit required by Subsection (g), for eligible persons in the county in which the property is located, on social, educational, or economic development services, capital improvement projects, or rent reduction.
    
    (f)  An organization entitled to an exemption under Subsection (b) is also entitled to an exemption from taxation of any building or tangible personal property the organization owns and uses in the administration of its acquisition, building, repair, sale, or rental of property.  To qualify for an exemption under this subsection, property must be used exclusively by the organization, except that another person may use the property for activities incidental to the organization's use that benefit the beneficiaries of the organization.
    
    (g)  To receive an exemption under Subsection (b) or (f), an organization must annually:
    
    (1)  have an audit prepared by an independent auditor that includes a detailed report on the organization's sources and uses of funds; and
    
    (2)  deliver a copy of the audit to the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs and to the chief appraiser of the appraisal district in which the property subject to the exemption is located.
    
    (h)  Subsections (d) and (e)(3) do not apply to property owned by an organization if:
    
    (1)  the entity that provided the financing for the acquisition or construction of the property:
    
    (A)  requires the organization to make payments in lieu of taxes to the school district in which the property is located;  or
    
    (B)  restricts the amount of rent the organization may charge for dwelling units on the property;  or
    
    (2)  the organization has entered into an agreement with each taxing unit for which the property receives an exemption to spend in each tax year for the purposes provided by Subsection (d) or (e)(3) an amount equal to the total amount of taxes imposed on the property in the tax year preceding the year in which the organization acquired the property.
    
    (i)  If any property owned by an organization receiving an exemption under this section has been acquired or sold during the preceding year, such organization shall file by March 31 of the following year with the chief appraiser in the county in which the relevant property is located, on a form promulgated by the comptroller of public accounts, a list of such properties acquired or sold during the preceding year.
    
    (j)  An organization may not receive an exemption under Subsection (b) or (f) for property for a tax year unless the organization received an exemption under that subsection for the property for any part of the 2003 tax year.
    
    (k)  Notwithstanding Subsection (j) of this section and Sections [11.43](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.43)(a) and (c), an exemption under Subsection (b) or (f) does not terminate because of a change in the ownership of the property if the property is sold at a foreclosure sale and, not later than the 30th day after the date of the sale, the owner of the property submits to the chief appraiser evidence that the property is owned by an organization that meets the requirements of Subsections (b)(1), (2), and (4).  If the owner of the property submits the evidence required by this subsection, the exemption continues to apply to the property for the remainder of the current tax year and for subsequent tax years until the owner ceases to qualify the property for the exemption.  This subsection does not prohibit the chief appraiser from requiring the owner to file a new application to confirm the owner's current qualification for the exemption as provided by Section [11.43](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.43)(c).

    Sec. 11.1825.  ORGANIZATIONS CONSTRUCTING OR REHABILITATING LOW-INCOME HOUSING:  PROPERTY NOT PREVIOUSLY EXEMPT.  (a)  An organization is entitled to an exemption from taxation of real property owned by the organization that the organization constructs or rehabilitates and uses to provide housing to individuals or families meeting the income eligibility requirements of this section.
    
    (a-1)  An organization that leases land under a ground lease is entitled to an exemption from taxation of the improvements owned by the organization that the organization constructs or rehabilitates and uses to provide housing to individuals or families meeting the income eligibility requirements of this section.  An organization that leases land as described by this subsection is considered to be the owner of the land for purposes of the provisions of this section requiring that an organization own property for the purpose of constructing or rehabilitating a housing project on the property in order to receive an exemption for the property.  A reference in this section to acquiring property includes leasing the property as described by this subsection.  A reference in this section to an exemption from taxation or the appraisal of property means the improvements constructed or rehabilitated on the property if the property consists of land and improvements described by this subsection.
    
    (b)  To receive an exemption under this section, an organization must meet the following requirements:

    (q)  If property qualifies for an exemption under this section, the chief appraiser shall use the income method of appraisal as described by Section [23.012](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=23.012) to determine the appraised value of the property.  The chief appraiser shall use that method regardless of whether the chief appraiser considers that method to be the most appropriate method of appraising the property.  In appraising the property, the chief appraiser shall:
    
    (1)  consider the restrictions provided by this section on the income of the individuals or families to whom the dwelling units of the housing project may be rented and the amount of rent that may be charged for purposes of computing the actual rental income from the property or projecting future rental income; and

    (t)  Notwithstanding Section [11.43](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.43)(c), an exemption under this section does not terminate because of a change in ownership of the property if:
    
    (1)  the property is foreclosed on for any reason and, not later than the 30th day after the date of the foreclosure sale, the owner of the property submits to the chief appraiser evidence that the property is owned by:
    
    (A)  an organization that meets the requirements of Subsection (b);  or
    
    (B)  an entity that meets the requirements of Subsections (c) and (d);  or
    
    (2)  in the case of property owned by an entity described by Subsections (c) and (d), the organization meeting the requirements of Subsection (b) that controls the general partner interest of or is the parent of the entity as described by Subsection (c) ceases to serve in that capacity and, not later than the 30th day after the date the cessation occurs, the owner of the property submits evidence to the chief appraiser that the organization has been succeeded in that capacity by another organization that meets the requirements of Subsection (b).
    
    (u)  The chief appraiser may extend the deadline provided by Subsection (t)(1) or (2), as applicable, for good cause shown.
    
    (v)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an organization may not receive an exemption from taxation of property described by Subsection (f)(1) by a taxing unit any part of which is located in a county with a population of at least 2.1 million unless the exemption is approved by the governing body of the taxing unit in the manner provided by law for official action.
    
    (w)  To receive an exemption under this section from taxation by a taxing unit for which the approval of the governing body of the taxing unit is required by Subsection (v), an organization must submit to the governing body of the taxing unit a written request for approval of the exemption from taxation of the property described in the request.
    
    (x)  Not later than the 60th day after the date the governing body of the taxing unit receives a written request under Subsection (w) for an exemption under this section, the governing body shall:
    
    (1)  approve the exemption in the amount provided by Subsection (s);
    
    (2)  approve the exemption in a reasonable amount other than the amount provided by Subsection (s);  or
    
    (3)  deny the exemption if the governing body determines that:
    
    (A)  the taxing unit cannot afford the loss of ad valorem tax revenue that would result from approving the exemption;  or
    
    (B)  additional housing for individuals or families meeting the income eligibility requirements of this section is not needed in the territory of the taxing unit.
    
    (y)  Not later than the fifth day after the date the governing body of the taxing unit takes action under Subsection (x), the taxing unit shall issue a letter to the organization stating the governing body's action and, if the governing body denied the exemption, stating whether the denial was based on a determination under Subsection (x)(3)(A) or (B) and the basis for the determination.  The taxing unit shall send a copy of the letter by regular mail to the chief appraiser of each appraisal district that appraises the property for the taxing unit.  The governing body may charge the organization a fee not to exceed the administrative costs of processing the request of the organization, approving or denying the exemption, and issuing the letter required by this subsection.  If the chief appraiser determines that the property qualifies for an exemption under this section and the governing body of the taxing unit approves the exemption, the chief appraiser shall grant the exemption in the amount approved by the governing body.

    Sec. 11.251.  TANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY EXEMPT.  (a)  In this section, "freeport goods" means property that under Article VIII, Section [1-j](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=8.1-j), of the Texas Constitution is not taxable.  
    
    (b)  A person is entitled to an exemption from taxation by a taxing unit of the appraised value of that portion of the person's inventory or property consisting of freeport goods as determined under this section for the taxing unit.
    
    (c)  The exemption provided by Subsection (b) is subtracted from the market value of the inventory or property determined under Section [23.12](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=23.12) to determine the taxable value of the inventory or property for the taxing unit.
    
    (d)  Except as provided by Subsections (f) and (g), the chief appraiser shall determine the appraised value of freeport goods under this subsection.  The chief appraiser shall determine the percentage of the market value of inventory or property owned by the property owner in the preceding calendar year that was contributed by freeport goods.  The chief appraiser shall apply that percentage to the market value of the property owner's inventory or property for the current year to determine the appraised value of freeport goods for the current year.
    
    (e)  In determining the market value of freeport goods that in the preceding year were assembled, manufactured, repaired, maintained, processed, or fabricated in this state or used by the person who acquired or imported the property in the repair or maintenance of aircraft operated by a certificated air carrier, the chief appraiser shall exclude the cost of equipment, machinery, or materials that entered into and became component parts of the freeport goods but were not themselves freeport goods or that were not transported outside the state before the expiration of 175 days, or, if applicable, the greater number of days adopted by the taxing unit as authorized by Subsection (l), after they were brought into this state by the property owner or acquired by the property owner in this state. For component parts held in bulk, the chief appraiser may use the average length of time a component part was held in this state by the property owner during the preceding year in determining whether the component parts were transported out of this state before the expiration of 175 days or, if applicable, the greater number of days adopted by the taxing unit as authorized by Subsection (l).
    
    (f)  If the property owner was not engaged in transporting freeport goods out of this state for the entire preceding year, the chief appraiser shall calculate the percentage of cost described in Subsection (d) for the portion of the year in which the property owner was engaged in transporting freeport goods out of this state.
    
    (g)  If the property owner or the chief appraiser demonstrates that the method provided by Subsection (d) significantly understates or overstates the market value of the property qualified for an exemption under Subsection (b) in the current year, the chief appraiser shall determine the market value of the freeport goods to be exempt by determining, according to the property owner's records and any other available information, the market value of those freeport goods owned by the property owner on January 1 of the current year, excluding the cost of equipment, machinery, or materials that entered into and became component parts of the freeport goods but were not themselves freeport goods or that were not transported outside the state before the expiration of 175 days, or, if applicable, the greater number of days adopted by the taxing unit as authorized by Subsection (l), after they were brought into this state by the property owner or acquired by the property owner in this state.
    
    (h)  The chief appraiser by written notice delivered to a property owner who claims an exemption under this section may require the property owner or a person designated in writing by the importer of record to provide copies of inventory or property records in order to determine the amount and value of freeport goods.  If the property owner or designated person fails to deliver the information requested in the notice before the 31st day after the date the notice is delivered to the property owner or before the date the appraisal review board approves the appraisal records under Section [41.12](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41.12), whichever is later, the property owner forfeits the right to claim or receive the exemption for that year.  If the property owner or designated person delivers the information requested in the notice before the date the appraisal review board approves the appraisal records but not before the 31st day after the date the notice is delivered to the property owner and the exemption is allowed, the property owner is liable to each taxing unit for a penalty in an amount equal to 10 percent of the difference between the amount of tax imposed by the taxing unit on the inventory or property and the amount that would otherwise have been imposed.  The chief appraiser shall make an entry on the appraisal records for the inventory or property indicating the property owner's liability for the penalty and shall deliver a written notice of imposition of the penalty, explaining the reason for its imposition, to the property owner.  The assessor for a taxing unit that taxes the inventory or property shall add the amount of the penalty to the property owner's tax bill, and the tax collector for the unit shall collect the penalty at the time and in the manner the collector collects the tax.  The amount of the penalty constitutes a lien against the inventory or property against which the penalty is imposed, as if it were a tax, and accrues penalty and interest in the same manner as a delinquent tax.
    
    (i)  The exemption provided by Subsection (b) does not apply to a taxing unit that takes action to tax the property under Article VIII, Section 1-j, Subsection (b), of the Texas Constitution.
    
    (j)  Petroleum products as set forth in Article VIII, Section [1-j](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=8.1-j), of the Texas Constitution shall mean liquid and gaseous materials that are the immediate derivatives of the refining of oil or natural gas.
    
    (k)  Property that meets the requirements of Article VIII, Sections [1-j](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=8.1-j)(a)(1) and (2), of the Texas Constitution and that is transported outside of this state not later than 175 days, or, if applicable, the greater number of days adopted by the taxing unit as authorized by Subsection (l), after the date the person who owns it on January 1 acquired it or imported it into this state is freeport goods regardless of whether the person who owns it on January 1 is the person who transports it outside of this state.
    
    (l)  The governing body of a taxing unit, in the manner provided by law for official action, may extend the date by which freeport goods that are aircraft parts must be transported outside the state to a date not later than the 730th day after the date the person acquired or imported the property in this state.  An extension adopted by official action under this subsection applies only to the exemption from ad valorem taxation by the taxing unit adopting the extension and applies to:
    
    (1)  the tax year:
    
    (A)  in which the extension is adopted if officially adopted before June 1 of a tax year; or
    
    (B)  immediately following the tax year in which the extension is adopted if officially adopted on or after June 1 of a tax year; and
    
    (2)  each tax year following the year of adoption of the extension.

    (2)  the vehicle is used primarily for activities that do not involve the production of income.
    
    (b)  For purposes of this section, a motor vehicle is presumed to be used primarily for activities that do not involve the production of income if:

    (A)  is leased to an organization that is exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a), Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as an organization described by Section 501(c)(3) of that code; and
    
    (B)  would be exempt from taxation if the vehicle were owned by the organization.
    
    (c)  The comptroller by rule shall establish exemption application requirements and appropriate procedures to determine whether a motor vehicle subject to a lease qualifies for an exemption under Subsection (a).
    
    (d)  In connection with the requirements and procedures under Subsection (c), the comptroller by rule shall adopt a form to be completed by the lessee of a motor vehicle for which the owner of the vehicle may apply for an exemption under Subsection (a).  The form shall require a lessee who is an individual to provide the lessee's name, address, and driver's license or personal identification certificate number.  The form shall require a lessee that is an entity described by Subsection (b) to provide the lessee's name, address, and, if applicable, federal tax identification number.  The form shall require a lessee who is an individual, or the authorized representative of a lessee that is an entity described by Subsection (b), to certify, either under oath or by written, unsworn declaration, that the lessee does not hold the vehicle for the production of income and that the vehicle is used primarily for activities that do not involve the production of income.  The comptroller shall include on the form a notice of the penalties prescribed by Section [37.10](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=37.10), Penal Code, for making a false statement on the form.
    
    (e)  The owner of a motor vehicle that is subject to a lease shall maintain the form, an electronic image of the form, or a certified copy of the form completed by the lessee of the vehicle and make the form, electronic image, or certified copy available for inspection and copying by the chief appraiser of the applicable appraisal district at all reasonable times.  If the owner does not maintain a completed form, electronic image of the completed form, or certified copy of the completed form relating to the vehicle, the owner:
    
    (1)  must render the vehicle for taxation in the applicable rendition statement or property report filed by the owner under Chapter [22](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=22); and
    
    (2)  may not file an application for an exemption under Subsection (a) for the vehicle.
    
    (f)  The governing body of a municipality by ordinance adopted before January 1, 2002, may provide for the taxation of leased motor vehicles otherwise exempted under Subsection (a).  If the governing body of a municipality provides for the taxation of leased motor vehicles under this subsection, the exemption provided by Subsection (a) does not apply to that municipality.

    (2)  "Goods-in-transit" means tangible personal property that:
    
    (A)  is acquired in or imported into this state to be forwarded to another location in this state or outside this state;

    (D)  does not include oil, natural gas, petroleum products, aircraft, dealer's motor vehicle inventory, dealer's vessel and outboard motor inventory, dealer's heavy equipment inventory, or retail manufactured housing inventory.

    (A)  is both a bailee and a warehouse; and
    
    (B)  stores under a contract of bailment, at one or more public warehouse facilities, tangible personal property that is owned by other persons solely for the account of those persons and not for the operator's account.
    
    (b)  A person is entitled to an exemption from taxation of the appraised value of that portion of the person's property that consists of goods-in-transit.
    
    (c)  The exemption provided by Subsection (b) is subtracted from the market value of the property determined under Section [23.01](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=23.01) or [23.12](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=23.12), as applicable, to determine the taxable value of the property.
    
    (d)  Except as provided by Subsections (f) and (g), the chief appraiser shall determine the appraised value of goods-in-transit under this subsection.  The chief appraiser shall determine the percentage of the market value of tangible personal property owned by the property owner and used for the production of income in the preceding calendar year that was contributed by goods-in-transit.  For the first year in which the exemption applies to a taxing unit, the chief appraiser shall determine that percentage as if the exemption applied in the preceding year.  The chief appraiser shall apply that percentage to the market value of the property owner's tangible personal property used for the production of income for the current year to determine the appraised value of goods-in-transit for the current year.
    
    (e)  In determining the market value of goods-in-transit that in the preceding year were stored in this state, the chief appraiser shall exclude the cost of equipment, machinery, or materials that entered into and became component parts of the goods-in-transit but were not themselves goods-in-transit or that were not transported to another location in this state or outside this state before the expiration of 175 days after the date they were brought into this state by the property owner or acquired by the property owner in this state.  For component parts held in bulk, the chief appraiser may use the average length of time a component part was held by the owner of the component parts during the preceding year at a location in this state that was not owned by or under the control of the owner of the component parts in determining whether the component parts were transported to another location in this state or outside this state before the expiration of 175 days.
    
    (f)  If the property owner was not engaged in transporting goods-in-transit to another location in this state or outside this state for the entire preceding year, the chief appraiser shall calculate the percentage of the market value described in Subsection (d) for the portion of the year in which the property owner was engaged in transporting goods-in-transit to another location in this state or outside this state.
    
    (g)  If the property owner or the chief appraiser demonstrates that the method provided by Subsection (d) significantly understates or overstates the market value of the property qualified for an exemption under Subsection (b) in the current year, the chief appraiser shall determine the market value of the goods-in-transit to be exempt by determining, according to the property owner's records and any other available information, the market value of those goods-in-transit owned by the property owner on January 1 of the current year, excluding the cost of equipment, machinery, or materials that entered into and became component parts of the goods-in-transit but were not themselves goods-in-transit or that were not transported to another location in this state or outside this state before the expiration of 175 days after the date they were brought into this state by the property owner or acquired by the property owner in this state.
    
    (h)  The chief appraiser by written notice delivered to a property owner who claims an exemption under this section may require the property owner to provide copies of property records so the chief appraiser can determine the amount and value of goods-in-transit and that the location in this state where the goods-in-transit were detained for storage was not owned by or under the control of the owner of the goods-in-transit.  If the property owner fails to deliver the information requested in the notice before the 31st day after the date the notice is delivered to the property owner, the property owner forfeits the right to claim or receive the exemption for that year.
    
    (i)  Property that meets the requirements of this section constitutes goods-in-transit regardless of whether the person who owns the property on January 1 is the person who transports the property to another location in this state or outside this state.
    
    (j)  The governing body of a taxing unit, in the manner required for official action by the governing body, may provide for the taxation of goods-in-transit exempt under Subsection (b) and not exempt under other law.  The official action to tax the goods-in-transit must be taken before January 1 of the first tax year in which the governing body proposes to tax goods-in-transit.  Before acting to tax the exempt property, the governing body of the taxing unit must conduct a public hearing as required by Section [1-n](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=8.1-n)(d), Article VIII, Texas Constitution.  If the governing body of a taxing unit provides for the taxation of the goods-in-transit as provided by this subsection, the exemption prescribed by Subsection (b) does not apply to that unit.  The goods-in-transit remain subject to taxation by the taxing unit until the governing body of the taxing unit, in the manner required for official action, rescinds or repeals its previous action to tax goods-in-transit, or otherwise determines that the exemption prescribed by Subsection (b) will apply to that taxing unit.
    
    (j-1)  Notwithstanding Subsection (j) or official action that was taken under that subsection before October 1, 2011, to tax goods-in-transit exempt under Subsection (b) and not exempt under other law, a taxing unit may not tax such goods-in-transit in a tax year that begins on or after January 1, 2012, unless the governing body of the taxing unit takes action on or after October 1, 2011, in the manner required for official action by the governing body, to provide for the taxation of the goods-in-transit.  The official action to tax the goods-in-transit must be taken before January 1 of the first tax year in which the governing body proposes to tax goods-in-transit.  Before acting to tax the exempt property, the governing body of the taxing unit must conduct a public hearing as required by Section [1-n](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=8.1-n)(d), Article VIII, Texas Constitution.  If the governing body of a taxing unit provides for the taxation of the goods-in-transit as provided by this subsection, the exemption prescribed by Subsection (b) does not apply to that unit.  The goods-in-transit remain subject to taxation by the taxing unit until the governing body of the taxing unit, in the manner required for official action, rescinds or repeals its previous action to tax goods-in-transit or otherwise determines that the exemption prescribed by Subsection (b) will apply to that taxing unit.
    
    (j-2)  Notwithstanding Subsection (j-1), if under Subsection (j) the governing body of a taxing unit, before October 1, 2011, took action to provide for the taxation of goods-in-transit and pledged the taxes imposed on the goods-in-transit for the payment of a debt of the taxing unit, the tax officials of the taxing unit may continue to impose the taxes against the goods-in-transit until the debt is discharged, if cessation of the imposition would impair the obligation of the contract by which the debt was created.
    
    (k)  A property owner who receives the exemption from taxation provided by Subsection (b) is not eligible to receive the exemption from taxation provided by Section [11.251](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.251) for the same property.
    
    (l)  This subsection applies only to a taxing unit any part of which is located in an area designated a disaster area by a disaster declaration issued under Section [418.014](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=418.014) or [418.108](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=418.108), Government Code, on or after January 1, 2020.  Notwithstanding Subsections (a)(2)(C), (e), and (g), the governing body of a taxing unit, in the manner provided by law for official action, may extend the date by which goods-in-transit must be transported to another location in this state or outside this state to a date not later than the 270th day after the date the person acquired the property in or imported the property into this state. An extension adopted by official action under this subsection applies only to:
    
    (1)  the exemption from ad valorem taxation by the taxing unit adopting the extension; and
    
    (2)  the tax year in which the extension is adopted.
    
    (m)  This subsection and Subsection (l) expire December 31, 2025.

    Sec. 11.26.  LIMITATION OF SCHOOL TAX ON HOMESTEADS OF ELDERLY OR DISABLED.  (a)  The tax officials shall appraise the property to which this section applies and calculate taxes as on other property, but if the tax so calculated exceeds the limitation imposed by this section, the tax imposed is the amount of the tax as limited by this section, except as otherwise provided by this section.  A school district may not increase the total annual amount of ad valorem tax it imposes on the residence homestead of an individual 65 years of age or older or on the residence homestead of an individual who is disabled, as defined by Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13), above the amount of the tax it imposed in the first tax year in which the individual qualified that residence homestead for the applicable exemption provided by Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13)(c) for an individual who is 65 years of age or older or is disabled.  If the individual qualified that residence homestead for the exemption after the beginning of that first year and the residence homestead remains eligible for the same exemption for the next year, and if the school district taxes imposed on the residence homestead in the next year are less than the amount of taxes imposed in that first year, a school district may not subsequently increase the total annual amount of ad valorem taxes it imposes on the residence homestead above the amount it imposed in the year immediately following the first year for which the individual qualified that residence homestead for the same exemption, except as provided by Subsection (b).
    
    (a-4)  In this section, "maximum compressed rate" means the maximum compressed rate of a school district as calculated under Section [48.2551](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.2551), Education Code.

    (a-5)  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, if in the 2023 tax year an individual qualifies for a limitation on tax increases provided by this section on the individual's residence homestead and the first tax year the individual or the individual's spouse qualified for an exemption under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13)(c) for the same homestead was a tax year before the 2019 tax year, the amount of the limitation provided by this section on the homestead in the 2023 tax year is equal to the amount computed by:
    
    (1)  multiplying the taxable value of the homestead in the 2018 tax year by a tax rate equal to the difference between the school district's tier one maintenance and operations rate for the 2018 tax year and the district's maximum compressed rate for the 2019 tax year;
    
    (2)  subtracting the greater of zero or the amount computed under Subdivision (1) from the amount of tax the district imposed on the homestead in the 2018 tax year;
    
    (3)  adding any tax imposed in the 2019 tax year attributable to improvements made in the 2018 tax year as provided by Subsection (b) to the amount computed under Subdivision (2);

    (14)  subtracting the amount computed under Subdivision (13) from the amount computed under Subdivision (12); and

    (a-8)  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, if in the 2023 tax year an individual qualifies for a limitation on tax increases provided by this section on the individual's residence homestead and the first tax year the individual or the individual's spouse qualified for an exemption under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13)(c) for the same homestead was the 2021 tax year, the amount of the limitation provided by this section on the homestead in the 2023 tax year is equal to the amount computed by:

    (a-9)  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, if in the 2023 tax year an individual qualifies for a limitation on tax increases provided by this section on the individual's residence homestead and the first tax year the individual or the individual's spouse qualified for an exemption under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13)(c) for the same homestead was the 2022 tax year, the amount of the limitation provided by this section on the homestead in the 2023 tax year is equal to the amount computed by:
    
    (1)  multiplying the taxable value of the homestead in the 2022 tax year by a tax rate equal to the difference between the school district's maximum compressed rate for the 2022 tax year and the district's maximum compressed rate for the 2023 tax year;
    
    (2)  subtracting the amount computed under Subdivision (1) from the amount of tax the district imposed on the homestead in the 2022 tax year; and
    
    (3)  adding any tax imposed in the 2023 tax year attributable to improvements made in the 2022 tax year as provided by Subsection (b) to the amount computed under Subdivision (2).
    
    (a-10)  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, if in the 2024 or a subsequent tax year an individual qualifies for a limitation on tax increases provided by this section on the individual's residence homestead, the amount of the limitation provided by this section on the homestead is equal to the amount computed by:
    
    (1)  multiplying the taxable value of the homestead in the preceding tax year by a tax rate equal to the difference between the school district's maximum compressed rate for the preceding tax year and the district's maximum compressed rate for the current tax year;
    
    (2)  subtracting the amount computed under Subdivision (1) from the amount of tax the district imposed on the homestead in the preceding tax year;
    
    (3)  adding any tax imposed in the current tax year attributable to improvements made in the preceding tax year as provided by Subsection (b) to the amount computed under Subdivision (2);
    
    (4)  multiplying the amount of any increase in the current tax year as compared to the preceding tax year in the aggregate amount of the exemptions to which the individual is entitled under Sections [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13)(b) and (c) by the school district's tax rate for the current tax year; and
    
    (5)  subtracting the amount computed under Subdivision (4) from the amount computed under Subdivision (3).
    
    (a-11)  This subsection applies only to an individual who in the 2023 tax year qualifies for a limitation under this section and for whom the 2022 tax year or an earlier tax year was the first tax year the individual or the individual's spouse qualified for an exemption under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13)(c).  The amount of the limitation provided by this section on the residence homestead of an individual to which this subsection applies for the 2023 tax year is the amount of the limitation as computed under Subsection (a-5), (a-6), (a-7), (a-8), or (a-9) of this section, as applicable, less an amount equal to the product of $60,000 and the tax rate of the school district for the 2023 tax year.  This subsection expires January 1, 2025.
    
    (a-12)  This subsection applies only to an individual who in the 2023 tax year qualifies for a limitation under this section and for whom the 2021 tax year or an earlier tax year was the first tax year the individual or the individual's spouse qualified for an exemption under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13)(c).  The amount of the limitation provided by this section on the residence homestead of an individual to which this subsection applies for the 2023 tax year is the amount of the limitation as computed under Subsection (a-11) of this section less an amount equal to the product of $15,000 and the tax rate of the school district for the 2022 tax year.  This subsection expires January 1, 2025.
    
    (b)  If an individual makes improvements to the individual's residence homestead, other than improvements required to comply with governmental requirements or repairs, the school district may increase the tax on the homestead in the first year the value of the homestead is increased on the appraisal roll because of the enhancement of value by the improvements.  The amount of the tax increase is determined by applying the current tax rate to the difference in the assessed value of the homestead with the improvements and the assessed value it would have had without the improvements.  A limitation imposed by this section then applies to the increased amount of tax until more improvements, if any, are made.
    
    (c)  The limitation on tax increases required by this section expires if on January 1:
    
    (1)  none of the owners of the structure who qualify for the exemption and who owned the structure when the limitation first took effect is using the structure as a residence homestead;  or
    
    (2)  none of the owners of the structure qualifies for the exemption.
    
    (d)  If the appraisal roll provides for taxation of appraised value for a prior year because a residence homestead exemption for individuals 65 years of age or older or for disabled individuals was erroneously allowed, the tax assessor shall add, as back taxes due as provided by Section [26.09](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.09)(d), the positive difference if any between the tax that should have been imposed for that year and the tax that was imposed because of the provisions of this section.
    
    (e)  For each school district in an appraisal district, the chief appraiser shall determine the portion of the appraised value of residence homesteads of individuals on which school district taxes are not imposed in a tax year because of the limitation on tax increases imposed by this section.  That portion is calculated by determining the taxable value that, if multiplied by the tax rate adopted by the school district for the tax year, would produce an amount equal to the amount of tax that would have been imposed by the school district on those residence homesteads if the limitation on tax increases imposed by this section were not in effect, but that was not imposed because of that limitation.  The chief appraiser shall determine that taxable value and certify it to the comptroller as soon as practicable for each tax year.
    
    (f)  The limitation on tax increases required by this section does not expire because the owner of an interest in the structure conveys the interest to a qualifying trust as defined by Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13)(j) if the owner or the owner's spouse is a trustor of the trust and is entitled to occupy the structure.
    
    (g)  Except as provided by Subsection (b), if an individual who receives a limitation on tax increases imposed by this section, including a surviving spouse who receives a limitation under Subsection (i), subsequently qualifies a different residence homestead for the same exemption under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13), a school district may not impose ad valorem taxes on the subsequently qualified homestead in a year in an amount that exceeds the amount of taxes the school district would have imposed on the subsequently qualified homestead in the first year in which the individual receives that same exemption for the subsequently qualified homestead had the limitation on tax increases imposed by this section not been in effect, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the total amount of school district taxes imposed on the former homestead in the last year in which the individual received that same exemption for the former homestead and the denominator of which is the total amount of school district taxes that would have been imposed on the former homestead in the last year in which the individual received that same exemption for the former homestead had the limitation on tax increases imposed by this section not been in effect.
    
    (h)  An individual who receives a limitation on tax increases under this section, including a surviving spouse who receives a limitation under Subsection (i), and who subsequently qualifies a different residence homestead for an exemption under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13), or an agent of the individual, is entitled to receive from the chief appraiser of the appraisal district in which the former homestead was located a written certificate providing the information necessary to determine whether the individual may qualify for that same limitation on the subsequently qualified homestead under Subsection (g) and to calculate the amount of taxes the school district may impose on the subsequently qualified homestead.
    
    (i)  If an individual who qualifies for the exemption provided by Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13)(c) dies, the surviving spouse of the individual is entitled to the limitation applicable to the residence homestead of the individual if:
    
    (1)  the surviving spouse is 55 years of age or older when the individual dies; and
    
    (2)  the residence homestead of the individual:
    
    (A)  is the residence homestead of the surviving spouse on the date that the individual dies; and
    
    (B)  remains the residence homestead of the surviving spouse.
    
    (i-1)  A limitation under Subsection (i) applicable to the residence homestead of the surviving spouse of an individual who was disabled and who died before January 1, 2020, is calculated as if the surviving spouse was entitled to the limitation when the individual died.
    
    (j)  If an individual who qualifies for an exemption provided by Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13)(c) for an individual 65 years of age or older dies in the first year in which the individual qualified for the exemption and the individual first qualified for the exemption after the beginning of that year, except as provided by Subsection (k), the amount to which the surviving spouse's school district taxes are limited under Subsection (i) is the amount of school district taxes imposed on the residence homestead in that year determined as if the individual qualifying for the exemption had lived for the entire year.
    
    (k)  If in the first tax year after the year in which an individual dies in the circumstances described by Subsection (j) the amount of school district taxes imposed on the residence homestead of the surviving spouse is less than the amount of school district taxes imposed in the preceding year as limited by Subsection (j), in a subsequent tax year the surviving spouse's school district taxes on that residence homestead are limited to the amount of taxes imposed by the district in that first tax year after the year in which the individual dies.
    
    (l)  For the purpose of calculating a limitation on ad valorem tax increases by a school district under this section, an individual who qualified a residence homestead before January 1, 2003, for an exemption under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13)(c) for a disabled individual is considered to have first qualified the homestead for that exemption on January 1, 2003.
    
    (m)  For the purpose of qualifying under Subsection (g) for the limitation on ad valorem taxes on a subsequently qualified homestead imposed by a school district, the residence homestead of a disabled individual may be considered to be a subsequently qualified homestead only if the disabled individual qualified the former homestead for an exemption under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13)(c) for a disabled individual for a tax year beginning on or after January 1, 2003.
    
    (n)  Notwithstanding Subsection (c), the limitation on tax increases required by this section does not expire if the owner of the structure qualifies for an exemption under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13) under the circumstances described by Section [11.135](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.135)(a).
    
    (o)  Notwithstanding Subsections (a) and (b), an improvement to property that would otherwise constitute an improvement under Subsection (b) is not treated as an improvement under that subsection if the improvement is a replacement structure for a structure that was rendered uninhabitable or unusable by a casualty or by wind or water damage.  For purposes of appraising the property in the tax year in which the structure would have constituted an improvement under Subsection (b), the replacement structure is considered to be an improvement under that subsection only if:
    
    (1)  the square footage of the replacement structure exceeds that of the replaced structure as that structure existed before the casualty or damage occurred; or
    
    (2)  the exterior of the replacement structure is of higher quality construction and composition than that of the replaced structure.
    
    (p)  An heir property owner who qualifies heir property as the owner's residence homestead under this chapter is considered the sole owner of the property for the purposes of this section.

    Sec. 11.261.  LIMITATION OF COUNTY, MUNICIPAL, OR JUNIOR COLLEGE DISTRICT TAX ON HOMESTEADS OF DISABLED AND ELDERLY.  (a)  This section applies only to a county, municipality, or junior college district that has established a limitation on the total amount of taxes that may be imposed by the county, municipality, or junior college district on the residence homestead of a disabled individual or an individual 65 years of age or older under Section [1-b](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=8.1-b)(h), Article VIII, Texas Constitution.
    
    (b)  The tax officials shall appraise the property to which the limitation applies and calculate taxes as on other property, but if the tax so calculated exceeds the limitation provided by this section, the tax imposed is the amount of the tax as limited by this section, except as otherwise provided by this section.  The county, municipality, or junior college district may not increase the total annual amount of ad valorem taxes the county, municipality, or junior college district imposes on the residence homestead of a disabled individual or an individual 65 years of age or older above the amount of the taxes the county, municipality, or junior college district imposed on the residence homestead in the first tax year, other than a tax year preceding the tax year in which the county, municipality, or junior college district established the limitation described by Subsection (a), in which the individual qualified that residence homestead for the exemption provided by Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13)(c) for a disabled individual or an individual 65 years of age or older.  If the individual qualified that residence homestead for the exemption after the beginning of that first year and the residence homestead remains eligible for the exemption for the next year, and if the county, municipal, or junior college district taxes imposed on the residence homestead in the next year are less than the amount of taxes imposed in that first year, a county, municipality, or junior college district may not subsequently increase the total annual amount of ad valorem taxes it imposes on the residence homestead above the amount it imposed on the residence homestead in the year immediately following the first year, other than a tax year preceding the tax year in which the county, municipality, or junior college district established the limitation described by Subsection (a), for which the individual qualified that residence homestead for the exemption.
    
    (c)  If an individual makes improvements to the individual's residence homestead, other than repairs and other than improvements required to comply with governmental requirements, the county, municipality, or junior college district may increase the amount of taxes on the homestead in the first year the value of the homestead is increased on the appraisal roll because of the enhancement of value by the improvements.  The amount of the tax increase is determined by applying the current tax rate to the difference between the appraised value of the homestead with the improvements and the appraised value it would have had without the improvements.  A limitation provided by this section then applies to the increased amount of county, municipal, or junior college district taxes on the residence homestead until more improvements, if any, are made.
    
    (d)  A limitation on county, municipal, or junior college district tax increases provided by this section expires if on January 1:
    
    (1)  none of the owners of the structure who qualify for the exemption provided by Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13)(c) for a disabled individual or an individual 65 years of age or older and who owned the structure when the limitation provided by this section first took effect is using the structure as a residence homestead;  or
    
    (2)  none of the owners of the structure qualifies for the exemption provided by Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13)(c) for a disabled individual or an individual 65 years of age or older.
    
    (e)  If the appraisal roll provides for taxation of appraised value for a prior year because a residence homestead exemption for disabled individuals or individuals 65 years of age or older was erroneously allowed, the tax assessor for the applicable county, municipality, or junior college district shall add, as back taxes due as provided by Section [26.09](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.09)(d), the positive difference, if any, between the tax that should have been imposed for that year and the tax that was imposed because of the provisions of this section.
    
    (f)  A limitation on tax increases provided by this section does not expire because the owner of an interest in the structure conveys the interest to a qualifying trust as defined by Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13)(j) if the owner or the owner's spouse is a trustor of the trust and is entitled to occupy the structure.
    
    (g)  Except as provided by Subsection (c), if an individual who receives a limitation on county, municipal, or junior college district tax increases provided by this section subsequently qualifies a different residence homestead in the same county, municipality, or junior college district for an exemption under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13), the county, municipality, or junior college district may not impose ad valorem taxes on the subsequently qualified homestead in a year in an amount that exceeds the amount of taxes the county, municipality, or junior college district would have imposed on the subsequently qualified homestead in the first year in which the individual receives that exemption for the subsequently qualified homestead had the limitation on tax increases provided by this section not been in effect, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the total amount of taxes the county, municipality, or junior college district imposed on the former homestead in the last year in which the individual received that exemption for the former homestead and the denominator of which is the total amount of taxes the county, municipality, or junior college district would have imposed on the former homestead in the last year in which the individual received that exemption for the former homestead had the limitation on tax increases provided by this section not been in effect.
    
    (h)  An individual who receives a limitation on county, municipal, or junior college district tax increases under this section and who subsequently qualifies a different residence homestead in the same county, municipality, or junior college district for an exemption under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13), or an agent of the individual, is entitled to receive from the chief appraiser of the appraisal district in which the former homestead was located a written certificate providing the information necessary to determine whether the individual may qualify for a limitation on the subsequently qualified homestead under Subsection (g) and to calculate the amount of taxes the county, municipality, or junior college district may impose on the subsequently qualified homestead.
    
    (i)  If an individual who qualifies for a limitation on county, municipal, or junior college district tax increases under this section dies, the surviving spouse of the individual is entitled to the limitation on taxes imposed by the county, municipality, or junior college district on the residence homestead of the individual if:
    
    (1)  the surviving spouse is disabled or is 55 years of age or older when the individual dies;  and
    
    (2)  the residence homestead of the individual:
    
    (A)  is the residence homestead of the surviving spouse on the date that the individual dies;  and
    
    (B)  remains the residence homestead of the surviving spouse.
    
    (j)  If an individual who is 65 years of age or older and qualifies for a limitation on county, municipal, or junior college district tax increases for the elderly under this section dies in the first year in which the individual qualified for the limitation and the individual first qualified for the limitation after the beginning of that year, except as provided by Subsection (k), the amount to which the surviving spouse's county, municipal, or junior college district taxes are limited under Subsection (i) is the amount of taxes imposed by the county, municipality, or junior college district, as applicable, on the residence homestead in that year determined as if the individual qualifying for the exemption had lived for the entire year.
    
    (k)  If in the first tax year after the year in which an individual who is 65 years of age or older dies under the circumstances described by Subsection (j) the amount of taxes imposed by a county, municipality, or junior college district on the residence homestead of the surviving spouse is less than the amount of taxes imposed by the county, municipality, or junior college district in the preceding year as limited by Subsection (j), in a subsequent tax year the surviving spouse's taxes imposed by the county, municipality, or junior college district on that residence homestead are limited to the amount of taxes imposed by the county, municipality, or junior college district in that first tax year after the year in which the individual dies.
    
    (l)  Notwithstanding Subsection (d), a limitation on county, municipal, or junior college district tax increases provided by this section does not expire if the owner of the structure qualifies for an exemption under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13) under the circumstances described by Section [11.135](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.135)(a).
    
    (m)  Notwithstanding Subsections (b) and (c), an improvement to property that would otherwise constitute an improvement under Subsection (c) is not treated as an improvement under that subsection if the improvement is a replacement structure for a structure that was rendered uninhabitable or unusable by a casualty or by wind or water damage.  For purposes of appraising the property in the tax year in which the structure would have constituted an improvement under Subsection (c), the replacement structure is considered to be an improvement under that subsection only if:
    
    (1)  the square footage of the replacement structure exceeds that of the replaced structure as that structure existed before the casualty or damage occurred; or
    
    (2)  the exterior of the replacement structure is of higher quality construction and composition than that of the replaced structure.
    
    (n)  An heir property owner who qualifies heir property as the owner's residence homestead under this chapter is considered the sole owner of the property for the purposes of this section.

    (1)  the anticipated environmental benefits from the installation of the facility, device, or method for the control of air, water, or land pollution;
    
    (2)  the estimated cost of the pollution control facility, device, or method; and
    
    (3)  the purpose of the installation of such facility, device, or method, and the proportion of the installation that is pollution control property.
    
    If the installation includes property that is not used wholly for the control of air, water, or land pollution, the person seeking the exemption shall also present such financial or other data as the executive director requires by rule for the determination of the proportion of the installation that is pollution control property.
    
    (d)  Following submission of the information required by Subsection (c), the executive director of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality shall determine if the facility, device, or method is used wholly or partly as a facility, device, or method for the control of air, water, or land pollution.  As soon as practicable, the executive director shall send notice by regular mail or by electronic means to the chief appraiser of the appraisal district for the county in which the property is located that the person has applied for a determination under this subsection.  The executive director shall issue a letter to the person stating the executive director's determination of whether the facility, device, or method is used wholly or partly to control pollution and, if applicable, the proportion of the property that is pollution control property.  The executive director shall send a copy of the letter by regular mail or by electronic means to the chief appraiser of the appraisal district for the county in which the property is located.
    
    (e)  Not later than the 20th day after the date of receipt of the letter issued by the executive director, the person seeking the exemption or the chief appraiser may appeal the executive director's determination to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.  The commission shall consider the appeal at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the commission for which adequate notice may be given.

    (l)  The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality by rule shall update the list adopted under Subsection (k) at least once every three years.  An item may be removed from the list if the commission finds compelling evidence to support the conclusion that the item does not provide pollution control benefits.
    
    (m)  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, if the facility, device, or method for the control of air, water, or land pollution described in an application for an exemption under this section is a facility, device, or method included on the list adopted under Subsection (k), the executive director of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, not later than the 30th day after the date of receipt of the information required by Subsections (c)(2) and (3) and without regard to whether the information required by Subsection (c)(1) has been submitted, shall determine that the facility, device, or method described in the application is used wholly or partly as a facility, device, or method for the control of air, water, or land pollution and shall take the actions that are required by Subsection (d) in the event such a determination is made.
    
    (n)  The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality shall establish a permanent advisory committee consisting of representatives of industry, appraisal districts, taxing units, and environmental groups, as well as members who are not representatives of any of those entities but have substantial technical expertise in pollution control technology and environmental engineering, to advise the commission regarding the implementation of this section.  At least one member of the advisory committee must be a representative of a school district or junior college district in which property is located that is or previously was subject to an exemption under this section.

    (c)  If the authority to limit tax increases under this section is approved by the voters and the governing body of the municipality enters into an agreement to limit tax increases under this section, the tax officials shall appraise the property to which the limitation applies and calculate taxes as on other property, but if the tax so calculated exceeds the limitation, the tax imposed is the amount of the tax as limited by this section, except as provided by Subsections (f) and (g).
    
    (d)  An agreement to limit tax increases under this section must be entered into before December 31 of the tax year in which the election was held.
    
    (e)  A taxing unit may not increase the total annual amount of ad valorem taxes the taxing unit imposes on the property above the amount of the taxes the taxing unit imposed on the property in the tax year in which the governing body of the municipality entered into an agreement to limit tax increases under this section.
    
    (f)  Subject to Subsection (g), an agreement to limit tax increases under this section expires on the earlier of:
    
    (1)  January 1 of the sixth tax year following the tax year in which the agreement was entered into; or
    
    (2)  January 1 of the first tax year in which the owner of the property when the agreement was entered into ceases to own the property.

    (h)  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), if the population of a municipality to which this section applies when the municipality enters into an agreement to limit taxes under this section subsequently increases to 10,000 or more, the validity of the agreement is not affected by that change in population, and the agreement does not expire because of that change.

    (f)  On receipt of an application for the exemption authorized by this section, the chief appraiser shall determine whether any item of qualified property that is the subject of the application is at least 15 percent damaged by the disaster and assign to each such item of qualified property a damage assessment rating of Level I, Level II, Level III, or Level IV, as appropriate, as provided by Subsection (g).  In determining the appropriate damage assessment rating, the chief appraiser may rely on information provided by a county emergency management authority, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or any other source the chief appraiser considers appropriate.
    
    (g)  The chief appraiser shall assign to an item of qualified property:
    
    (1)  a Level I damage assessment rating if the property is at least 15 percent, but less than 30 percent, damaged, meaning that the property suffered minimal damage and may continue to be used as intended;
    
    (2)  a Level II damage assessment rating if the property is at least 30 percent, but less than 60 percent, damaged, which, for qualified property described by Subsection (a)(2)(A)(ii) or (iii), means that the property has suffered only nonstructural damage, including nonstructural damage to the roof, walls, foundation, or mechanical components, and the waterline, if any, is less than 18 inches above the floor;
    
    (3)  a Level III damage assessment rating if the property is at least 60 percent damaged but is not a total loss, which, for qualified property described by Subsection (a)(2)(A)(ii) or (iii), means that the property has suffered significant structural damage requiring extensive repair due to the failure or partial failure of structural elements, wall elements, or the foundation, or the waterline is at least 18 inches above the floor; or
    
    (4)  a Level IV damage assessment rating if the property is a total loss, meaning that repair of the property is not feasible.
    
    (h)  Subject to Subsection (i), the amount of the exemption authorized by this section for an item of qualified property is determined by multiplying the appraised value, determined for the tax year in which the disaster occurred, of the property by:
    
    (1)  15 percent, if the property is assigned a Level I damage assessment rating;
    
    (2)  30 percent, if the property is assigned a Level II damage assessment rating;
    
    (3)  60 percent, if the property is assigned a Level III damage assessment rating; or
    
    (4)  100 percent, if the property is assigned a Level IV damage assessment rating.
    
    (i)  If a person qualifies for the exemption authorized by this section after the beginning of the tax year, the amount of the exemption is calculated by multiplying the amount determined under Subsection (h) by a fraction, the denominator of which is 365 and the numerator of which is the number of days remaining in the tax year after the day on which the governor first declares the area in which the person's qualified property is located to be a disaster area, including the day on which the governor makes the declaration.
    
    (j)  If a person qualifies for the exemption authorized by this section after the amount of the tax due on the qualified property is calculated and the effect of the qualification is to reduce the amount of the tax due on the property, the assessor for each applicable taxing unit shall recalculate the amount of the tax due on the property and correct the tax roll.  If the tax bill has been mailed and the tax on the property has not been paid, the assessor shall mail a corrected tax bill to the person in whose name the property is listed on the tax roll or to the person's authorized agent.  If the tax on the property has been paid, the tax collector for the taxing unit shall refund to the person who paid the tax the amount by which the payment exceeded the tax due.  No interest is due on an amount refunded under this subsection.
    
    (k)  The exemption authorized by this section expires as to an item of qualified property on January 1 of the first tax year in which the property is reappraised under Section [25.18](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=25.18).

However, the exemption does not apply to the value of the portion of the property that is used for those other functions.
    
    (i)  Section [25.07](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=25.07) does not apply to a leasehold interest in property for which the owner receives an exemption under this section.

    (b)  If the chief appraiser cancels an exemption for an organization or association under Section [11.18](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.18) or [11.19](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.19) that was erroneously allowed in a tax year because the chief appraiser determines that the organization or association did not satisfy the requirements of Section [11.18](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.18)(f)(2) or [11.19](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.19)(d)(5), as appropriate, on January 1 of that year, the organization or association is eligible for the exemption for that tax year if the organization or association:
    
    (1)  was otherwise qualified for the exemption;
    
    (2)  satisfies the requirements of Section [11.18](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.18)(f)(2) or [11.19](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.19)(d)(5), as appropriate, on or before the 60th day after the date the chief appraiser notifies the organization or association of the cancellation;  and
    
    (3)  within the time provided by Subdivision (2) files with the chief appraiser a new completed application for the exemption together with an affidavit stating that the organization or association has complied with the requirements of Section [11.18](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.18)(f)(2) or [11.19](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.19)(d)(5), as appropriate.

    Sec. 11.424.  CONFLICT BETWEEN GOVERNING REGULATION OF NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION, ASSOCIATION, OR ENTITY AND CONTRACT WITH UNITED STATES.  To the extent of a conflict between a provision in a contract entered into by an organization, association, or entity with the United States and a provision in the charter, a bylaw, or other regulation adopted by the organization or entity to govern its affairs in compliance with Section [11.18](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.18)(f)(2), [11.19](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.19)(d)(5), [11.20](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.20)(c)(4), or [11.21](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.21)(d)(5), the existence of the contract or the organization's compliance with the contract does not affect the eligibility of the organization, association, or entity to receive an exemption under the applicable section of this code, and the organization, association, or entity may comply with the provision in the contract instead of the conflicting provision in the charter, bylaw, or other regulation.

    Sec. 11.43.  APPLICATION FOR EXEMPTION.  (a)  To receive an exemption, a person claiming the exemption, other than an exemption authorized by Section [11.11](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.11), [11.12](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.12), [11.14](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.14), [11.141](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.141), [11.145](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.145), [11.146](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.146), [11.15](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.15), [11.16](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.16), [11.161](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.161), or [11.25](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.25), must apply for the exemption.  To apply for an exemption, a person must file an exemption application form with the chief appraiser for each appraisal district in which the property subject to the claimed exemption has situs.
    
    (b)  Except as provided by Subsection (c) and by Sections [11.184](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.184) and [11.437](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.437), a person required to apply for an exemption must apply each year the person claims entitlement to the exemption.
    
    (c)  An exemption provided by Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13), [11.131](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.131), [11.132](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.132), [11.133](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.133), [11.134](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.134), [11.17](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.17), [11.18](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.18), [11.182](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.182), [11.1827](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.1827), [11.183](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.183), [11.19](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.19), [11.20](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.20), [11.21](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.21), [11.22](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.22), [11.23](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.23)(a), (h), (j), (j-1), or (m), [11.231](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.231), [11.254](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.254), [11.27](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.27), [11.271](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.271), [11.29](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.29), [11.30](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.30), [11.31](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.31), [11.315](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.315), [11.35](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.35), or [11.36](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.36), once allowed, need not be claimed in subsequent years, and except as otherwise provided by Subsection (e), the exemption applies to the property until it changes ownership or the person's qualification for the exemption changes.  However, except as provided by Subsection (r), the chief appraiser may require a person allowed one of the exemptions in a prior year to file a new application to confirm the person's current qualification for the exemption by delivering a written notice that a new application is required, accompanied by an appropriate application form, to the person previously allowed the exemption.  If the person previously allowed the exemption is 65 years of age or older, the chief appraiser may not cancel the exemption due to the person's failure to file the new application unless the chief appraiser complies with the requirements of Subsection (q), if applicable.
    
    (d)  To receive an exemption the eligibility for which is determined by the claimant's qualifications on January 1 of the tax year, a person required to claim an exemption must file a completed exemption application form before May 1 and must furnish the information required by the form.  A person who after January 1 of a tax year acquires property that qualifies for an exemption covered by Section [11.42](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.42)(d) or (f) must apply for the exemption for the applicable portion of that tax year before the first anniversary of the date the person acquires the property.  For good cause shown the chief appraiser may extend the deadline for filing an exemption application by written order for a single period not to exceed 60 days.
    
    (e)  Except as provided by Section [11.422](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.422), [11.431](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.431), [11.433](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.433), [11.434](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.434), [11.435](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.435), or [11.439](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.439), or [11.4391](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.4391), if a person required to apply for an exemption in a given year fails to file timely a completed application form, the person may not receive the exemption for that year.
    
    (f)  The comptroller, in prescribing the contents of the application form for each kind of exemption, shall ensure that the form requires an applicant to furnish the information necessary to determine the validity of the exemption claim.  The form must require an applicant to provide the applicant's name and driver's license number, personal identification certificate number, or social security account number.  If the applicant is a charitable organization with a federal tax identification number, the form must allow the applicant to provide the organization's federal tax identification number in lieu of a driver's license number, personal identification certificate number, or social security account number.  The comptroller shall include on the forms a notice of the penalties prescribed by Section [37.10](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=37.10), Penal Code, for making or filing an application containing a false statement.  The comptroller shall include, on application forms for exemptions that do not have to be claimed annually, a statement explaining that the application need not be made annually and that if the exemption is allowed, the applicant has a duty to notify the chief appraiser when the applicant's entitlement to the exemption ends.  In this subsection:
    
    (1)  "Driver's license" has the meaning assigned that term by Section [521.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=521.001), Transportation Code.
    
    (2)  "Personal identification certificate" means a certificate issued by the Department of Public Safety under Subchapter [E](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=521.101), Chapter [521](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=521), Transportation Code.
    
    (g)  A person who receives an exemption that is not required to be claimed annually shall notify the appraisal office in writing before May 1 after his entitlement to the exemption ends.
    
    (h)  If the chief appraiser learns of any reason indicating that an exemption previously allowed should be canceled, the chief appraiser shall investigate. Subject to Subsection (q), if the chief appraiser determines that the property should not be exempt, the chief appraiser shall cancel the exemption and deliver written notice of the cancellation within five days after the date the exemption is canceled.
    
    (h-1)  The chief appraiser of an appraisal district shall develop a program for the periodic review of each residence homestead exemption granted by the district under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13) to confirm that the recipient of the exemption still qualifies for the exemption.  The program must require the chief appraiser to review each residence homestead exemption at least once every five tax years.  The program may provide for the review to take place in phases, with a portion of the exemptions reviewed in each tax year.
    
    (i)  If the chief appraiser discovers that an exemption that is not required to be claimed annually has been erroneously allowed in any one of the five preceding years, the chief appraiser shall add the property or appraised value that was erroneously exempted for each year to the appraisal roll as provided by Section [25.21](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=25.21) of this code for other property that escapes taxation.  If an exemption that was erroneously allowed did not apply to all taxing units in which the property was located, the chief appraiser shall note on the appraisal records, for each prior year, the taxing units that gave the exemption and are entitled to impose taxes on the property or value that escaped taxation.
    
    (j)  In addition to the items required by Subsection (f), an application for a residence homestead exemption prescribed by the comptroller and authorized by Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13) must:
    
    (1)  list each owner of the residence homestead and the interest of each owner;
    
    (2)  state that the applicant does not claim an exemption under that section on another residence homestead in this state or claim a residence homestead exemption on a residence homestead outside this state;
    
    (3)  state that each fact contained in the application is true;
    
    (4)  include a copy of the applicant's driver's license or state-issued personal identification certificate unless the applicant:
    
    (A)  is a resident of a facility that provides services related to health, infirmity, or aging; or
    
    (B)  is certified for participation in the address confidentiality program administered by the attorney general under Subchapter [B](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=58.051), Chapter [58](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=58), Code of Criminal Procedure;
    
    (5)  state that the applicant has read and understands the notice of the penalties required by Subsection (f); and
    
    (6)  be signed by the applicant.
    
    (k)  A person who qualifies for an exemption authorized by Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13)(c) or (d) or [11.132](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.132) must apply for the exemption no later than the first anniversary of the date the person qualified for the exemption.
    
    (l)  The form for an application under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13) must include a space for the applicant to state the applicant's date of birth and, if applicable, the date of birth of the applicant's spouse.  Failure to provide the applicant's date of birth does not affect the applicant's eligibility for an exemption under that section, other than an exemption under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13)(c) or (d) for an individual 65 years of age or older.   Failure to provide the date of birth of the applicant's spouse does not affect the applicant's eligibility for an exemption under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13) or the applicant's spouse's eligibility for an exemption under that section, other than an exemption under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13)(q) for the surviving spouse of an individual 65 years of age or older.
    
    (m)  Notwithstanding Subsections (a) and (k), if a person who receives an exemption under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13), other than an exemption under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13)(c) or (d) for an individual 65 years of age or older, in a tax year becomes 65 years of age in the next tax year, the person is entitled to receive and the chief appraiser shall allow an exemption under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13)(c) or (d) for an individual 65 years of age or older in that next tax year on the same property without requiring the person to apply for or otherwise request the exemption if the person's age is shown by:
    
    (1)  information in the records of the appraisal district that was provided to the appraisal district by the individual in an application for an exemption under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13) on the property or in correspondence relating to the property; or
    
    (2)  the information provided by the Texas Department of Public Safety to the appraisal district under Section [521.049](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=521.049), Transportation Code.
    
    (m-1)  Subsection (m) does not apply if the chief appraiser determines that the individual is no longer entitled to any exemption under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13) on the property.
    
    (m-2)  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), if a person who receives an exemption under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13)(d) for an individual 65 years of age or older dies in a tax year, that person's surviving spouse is entitled to receive an exemption under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13)(q) in the next tax year on the same property without applying for the exemption if:
    
    (1)  the appraisal district learns of the person's death from any source, including the death records maintained by the vital statistics unit of the Department of State Health Services or a local registration official; and
    
    (2)  the surviving spouse is otherwise eligible to receive the exemption as shown by:
    
    (A)  information in the records of the appraisal district that was provided to the appraisal district in an application for an exemption under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13) on the property or in correspondence relating to the property; or
    
    (B)  information provided by the Texas Department of Public Safety to the appraisal district under Section [521.049](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=521.049), Transportation Code.
    
    (m-3)  Subsection (m-2) does not apply if the chief appraiser determines that the surviving spouse is no longer entitled to any exemption under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13) on the property.
    
    (n)  Except as provided by Subsection (p), a chief appraiser may not allow an applicant an exemption provided by Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13) if the applicant is required under Subsection (j) to provide a copy of the applicant's driver's license or state-issued personal identification certificate unless  the address listed on the driver's license or state-issued personal identification certificate provided by the applicant corresponds to the address of the property for which the exemption is claimed.
    
    (o)  The application form for a residence homestead exemption must require an applicant who is not specifically identified on a deed or other appropriate instrument recorded in the real property records of the county in which the property is located as an owner of the residence homestead, including an heir property owner, to provide:
    
    (1)  an affidavit establishing the applicant's ownership of an interest in the property;
    
    (2)  a copy of the death certificate of the prior owner of the property, if the applicant is an heir property owner;
    
    (3)  a copy of the most recent utility bill for the property, if the applicant is an heir property owner; and
    
    (4)  a citation of any court record relating to the applicant's ownership of the property if available.
    
    (o-1)  The application form for a residence homestead exemption may not require an heir property owner to provide a copy of an instrument recorded in the real property records of the county in which the property is located.
    
    (o-2)  The application form for a residence homestead exemption must require:
    
    (1)  an applicant who is an heir property owner to state that the property for which the application is submitted is heir property; and
    
    (2)  each owner of an interest in heir property who occupies the property as the owner's principal residence, other than the applicant, to provide an affidavit that authorizes the submission of the application.
    
    (p)  A chief appraiser may waive the requirement provided by Subsection (n) that the address of the property for which the exemption is claimed correspond to the address listed on the driver's license or state-issued personal identification certificate provided by the applicant under Subsection (j) if the applicant:
    
    (1)  is an active duty member of the armed services of the United States or the spouse of an active duty member and the applicant includes with the application a copy of the applicant's or spouse's military identification card and a copy of a utility bill for the property subject to the claimed exemption in the applicant's or spouse's name; or
    
    (2)  holds a driver's license issued under Section [521.121](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=521.121)(c) or [521.1211](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=521.1211), Transportation Code, and includes with the application a copy of the application for that license provided to the Texas Department of Transportation.
    
    (q)  A chief appraiser may not cancel an exemption under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13) that is received by an individual who is 65 years of age or older without first providing written notice of the cancellation to the individual receiving the exemption.  The notice must include a form on which the individual may indicate whether the individual is qualified to receive the exemption and a self-addressed postage prepaid envelope with instructions for returning the form to the chief appraiser. The chief appraiser shall consider the individual's response on the form in determining whether to continue to allow the exemption. If the chief appraiser does not receive a response on or before the 60th day after the date the notice is mailed, the chief appraiser may cancel the exemption on or after the 30th day after the expiration of the 60-day period, but only after making a reasonable effort to locate the individual and determine whether the individual is qualified to receive the exemption. For purposes of this subsection, sending an additional notice of cancellation that includes, in bold font equal to or greater in size than the surrounding text, the date on which the chief appraiser is authorized to cancel the exemption to the individual receiving the exemption immediately after the expiration of the 60-day period by first class mail in an envelope on which is written, in all capital letters, "RETURN SERVICE REQUESTED," or another appropriate statement directing the United States Postal Service to return the notice if it is not deliverable as addressed, or providing the additional notice in another manner that the chief appraiser determines is appropriate, constitutes a reasonable effort on the part of the chief appraiser. This subsection does not apply to an exemption under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13)(c) or (d) for an individual 65 years of age or older that is canceled because the chief appraiser determines that the individual receiving the exemption no longer owns the property subject to the exemption.
    
    (r)  The chief appraiser may not require a person allowed an exemption under Section [11.131](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.131) to file a new application to determine the person's current qualification for the exemption if the person has a permanent total disability determined by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs under 38 C.F.R. Section 4.15.
    
    (s)  A person who qualifies for an exemption under Section [11.35](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.35)(b) must apply for the exemption not later than the 105th day after the date the governor declares the area in which the person's qualified property is located to be a disaster area.   The chief appraiser may extend the deadline prescribed by this subsection for good cause shown.

The collector shall calculate the amount of tax due on the property in that year as provided by Section [26.111](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.111) and shall refund any amount paid in excess of that amount.
    
    (c)  To facilitate the financing associated with the acquisition of a property, an organization, before acquiring the property, may request from the chief appraiser of the appraisal district established for the county in which the property is located a preliminary determination of whether the property would qualify for an exemption under Section [11.1825](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.1825) if acquired by the organization.

An exemption granted under this section applies to all cotton stored in the warehouse that is eligible to be exempt under Section [11.251](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.251).  Cotton that is stored in a warehouse covered by an exemption granted under this section and that is transported outside of this state is presumed to have been transported outside of this state within the time permitted by Article VIII, Section [1-j](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=8.1-j), of the Texas Constitution for cotton to qualify for an exemption under that section.
    
    (b)  An exemption granted under this section, once allowed, need not be claimed in subsequent years, and except as provided by Section [11.43](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.43)(e), the exemption applies to cotton stored in the warehouse until the warehouse changes ownership or the cotton's qualification for the exemption changes.  The chief appraiser may, however, require a person who operates a warehouse for which an exemption for cotton has been granted in a prior year to file a new application to confirm the cotton's current qualification for the exemption by delivering a written notice that a new application is required, accompanied by an appropriate application form, to the person.

    (b)  If the taxes and related penalties and interest imposed on the property for the year for which the exemption is claimed are paid before an application is filed under this section, the chief appraiser may approve the late application for an exemption only on a showing that the taxes, penalties, and interest were paid under protest.
    
    (c)  If a late application is approved after approval of the appraisal records for a year for which the exemption is granted, the chief appraiser shall notify the collector for each taxing unit in which the property was taxable in that year.  The collector shall deduct from the organization's tax bill the amount of tax imposed on the property for that year and any penalties and interest relating to that tax if the tax and related penalties and interest have not been paid.  If the tax and related penalties and interest on the property for a tax year for which an exemption is granted under this section were paid under protest, the organization is eligible for a refund of the tax, penalties, and interest paid as provided by Section [31.11](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=31.11).  The deadline prescribed by Section [31.11](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=31.11)(c) for applying for a refund does not apply to a refund under this section.

The collector shall correct the taxing unit's tax roll to reflect the amount of tax imposed on the property after applying the exemption and shall deduct from the person's tax bill the amount of tax imposed on the exempted portion of the property for that year.  If the tax and any related penalties and interest have been paid, the collector shall pay to the person who was the owner of the property on the date the tax was paid a refund of the tax imposed on the exempted portion of the property and the corresponding portion of any related penalties and interest paid.  The collector shall pay the refund not later than the 60th day after the date the chief appraiser notifies the collector of the approval of the exemption.
