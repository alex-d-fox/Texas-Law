    Sec. 321.001.  SHORT TITLE.  This chapter may be cited as the Municipal Sales and Use Tax Act.
    
    
    
    
    Added by Acts 1987, 70th Leg., ch. 191, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1987.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 321.002.  DEFINITIONS.  (a)  In this chapter:
    
    (1)  "Additional municipal sales and use tax" means only the additional tax authorized by Section [321.101](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=321.101)(b).
    
    (2)  "Municipality" includes any incorporated city, town, or village.
    
    (3)(A)  "Place of business of the retailer" means an established outlet, office, or location operated by the retailer or the retailer's agent or employee for the purpose of receiving orders for taxable items and includes any location at which three or more orders are received by the retailer during a calendar year.  A warehouse, storage yard, or manufacturing plant is not a "place of business of the retailer" unless at least three orders are received by the retailer during the calendar year at the warehouse, storage yard, or manufacturing plant.
    
    (B)  An outlet, office, facility, or any location that contracts with a retail or commercial business to process for that business invoices, purchase orders, bills of lading, or other equivalent records onto which sales tax is added, including an office operated for the purpose of buying and selling taxable goods to be used or consumed by the retail or commercial business, is not a "place of business of the retailer" if the comptroller determines that the outlet, office, facility, or location functions or exists to avoid the tax legally due under this chapter or exists solely to rebate a portion of the tax imposed by this chapter to the contracting business.  An outlet, office, facility, or location does not exist to avoid the tax legally due under this chapter or solely to rebate a portion of the tax imposed by this chapter if the outlet, office, facility, or location provides significant business services, beyond processing invoices, to the contracting business, including logistics management, purchasing, inventory control, or other vital business services.
    
    (C)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this subdivision, a kiosk is not a "place of business of the retailer."  In this subdivision, "kiosk" means a small stand-alone area or structure that:
    
    (i)  is used solely to display merchandise or to submit orders for taxable items from a data entry device, or both;
    
    (ii)  is located entirely within a location that is a place of business of another retailer, such as a department store or shopping mall; and
    
    (iii)  at which taxable items are not available for immediate delivery to a customer.
    
    (b)  Words used in this chapter and defined by Chapter [151](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=151) have the meanings assigned by Chapter [151](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=151).

    (d)  In any municipality in which an additional sales and use tax has been imposed, in the same manner and by the same procedure the municipality by majority vote of the qualified voters of the municipality voting at an election held for that purpose may reduce, increase, or abolish the additional sales and use tax.
    
    (e)  An authority created under Chapter [451](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=451) or [452](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=452), Transportation Code, is prohibited from imposing the tax provided for by those chapters if within the boundaries of the authority there is a municipality that has adopted the additional sales and use tax provided for by this section.

    (i)  A municipality for which the adoption or increase of a sales and use tax approved by the voters in an election held after May 1, 1995, and before December 31, 1995, is invalid because the election combined into a single proposition proposal for adopting an economic development sales and use tax under Chapter [505](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=505), Local Government Code, and an additional sales and use tax under Subsection (b)  may adopt or increase the sales and use tax previously approved by the voters by ordinance or resolution of the governing body of the municipality. If the governing body of the municipality adopts or increases the sales and use tax under this subsection, the municipal secretary shall send to the comptroller by certified or registered mail a certified copy of the ordinance or resolution.

    Sec. 321.102.  EFFECTIVE DATES:  NEW TAX, TAX REPEAL, BOUNDARY CHANGE.  (a)  A tax imposed under this chapter, a tax rate increase or decrease adopted under this chapter, or the repeal of a tax abolished under this chapter takes effect on the first day of the first calendar quarter occurring after the expiration of the first complete calendar quarter occurring after the date on which the comptroller receives a notice of the action as required by Section [321.405](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=321.405)(b).

    (c)  If a municipality in which the tax imposed under this chapter is in effect changes its boundaries, the municipal secretary shall send by United States registered or certified mail to the comptroller a certified copy of the ordinance that adds or detaches municipal territory and that shows the effective date of the boundary change.  The ordinance must be accompanied by a map clearly showing the added or detached territory.  Except as provided by Subsection (d), the tax takes effect in the added territory or is inapplicable to the detached territory on the first day of the first calendar quarter after the comptroller receives the ordinance and map.

    (f)  If an entity's rate is reduced in accordance with Subsection (e), the comptroller shall withhold from the municipality's monthly sales and use tax allocation an amount equal to the amount that would have been collected by the entity had the municipality not imposed or increased its sales and use tax or annexed the area in the entity less amounts that the entity collects following the municipality's levy of or increase in its sales and use tax or annexation of the area in the entity.  The comptroller shall withhold and pay the amount withheld to the entity under policies or procedures that the comptroller considers reasonable.
    
    (g)  Subsections (e) and (f) do not apply if and during any period in which a local governmental entity has outstanding indebtedness or obligations that are payable wholly or partly from the sales and use tax revenue of the entity.  A municipality may not implement the imposition or increase of the sales and use tax as a result of the circumstances described by Subsection (e) if, as a result of the implementation of that imposition or increase, the combined rate of all sales and use taxes imposed by the municipality, the local governmental entity, and any other political subdivisions having territory in the district would exceed two percent at any location in the municipality.
    
    (h)  A transit authority is not a local governmental entity for the purposes of Subsections (e) and (f).

    Sec. 321.205.  USE TAX:  MUNICIPALITY IN WHICH USE OCCURS.  (a)  In determining the incidence of the use tax authorized by this chapter the name of the municipality adopting the tax is substituted in Subchapter [D](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=151.101), Chapter [151](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=151), for "this state" where those words are used to designate the taxing entity or delimit the tax imposed.  However, the excise tax authorized by this chapter on the use, storage, or consumption of a taxable item does not apply if the item is first used, stored, or consumed in a municipality or area that has not adopted the taxes authorized by this chapter.
    
    (b)  If a sale of a taxable item is consummated in this state but not within a municipality that has adopted the taxes authorized by this chapter and the item is shipped directly, or brought by the purchaser or lessee directly, into a municipality that has adopted the taxes authorized by this chapter, the item is subject to the municipality's use tax.  The use is considered to be consummated at the location where the item is first stored, used, or consumed after the intrastate transit has ceased.
    
    (c)  If a taxable item is shipped from outside this state to a customer within this state and the use of the item is consummated within a municipality that has adopted the tax authorized by this chapter, the item is subject to the municipality's use tax and not its sales tax.  A use is considered to be consummated at the first point in this state where the item is stored, used, or consumed after the interstate transit has ceased.  A taxable item delivered to a point in this state is presumed to be for storage, use, or consumption at that point until the contrary is established.
    
    (d)  The holder of a direct payment permit issued under Chapter [151](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=151) who becomes liable for the use tax under this chapter by reason of the storage, use, or consumption of a taxable item purchased in this state under a direct payment exemption certificate shall allocate the tax to the municipality in which the item was first removed from the permit holder's storage, or if not stored, the place at which the item was first used or consumed by the permit holder after transportation.  In this subsection an item is not considered to have been stored, used, or consumed because of a temporary delay or interruption necessary and incidental to its transportation or further fabrication, processing, or assembling within this state for delivery to the permit holder.  A charge for fabrication, processing, or further assembly in a municipality that has adopted the tax under this chapter shall be subject to the municipal use tax.
    
    (e)  With respect to a taxable service, "use" means the derivation in the municipality of direct or indirect benefit from the service.

    (b)  Revenue from the collection of the additional municipal sales and use tax in each of the first three years in which the tax is imposed in the municipality in excess of the amount determined as provided by Section [26.041](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.041)(d), for each year shall be deposited in an account to be called the excess sales tax revenue fund.  During those three years, revenue deposited in the excess sales tax revenue fund may be spent only if and to the extent that taxes or other revenues of the municipality are collected in amounts less than anticipated.  After that period, the revenue in the fund may be used for any municipal purpose consistent with the municipality's budget.  The fund ceases to exist when all revenue deposited in the fund has been spent.  This subsection does not apply to a municipality that does not impose a property tax.
