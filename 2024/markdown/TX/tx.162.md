    Sec. 162.003.  COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER STATES.  (a)  The comptroller may enter into a cooperative agreement with another state for the collection of motor fuel taxes, the exchange of information, the auditing of users of motor fuel used in fleets of motor vehicles operated or intended for interstate operation, and the auditing of importers and exporters.  An agreement or amendment of an agreement takes effect according to its terms, except that an agreement or amendment may not take effect until the proposed agreement or amendment is published in the Texas Register.
    
    (b)  An agreement may provide for:
    
    (1)  determining the base state for motor fuel users;
    
    (2)  user, importer, and exporter records requirements;
    
    (3)  audit procedures;
    
    (4)  exchange of information;
    
    (5)  persons eligible for tax licensing;
    
    (6)  licensing and license revocation procedures, permits, penalties, and fees;
    
    (7)  defining qualified motor vehicles;
    
    (8)  determining bonding procedures, types, and amounts;
    
    (9)  specifying reporting requirements and periods;
    
    (10)  defining refund procedures and limitations, including the payment of interest;
    
    (11)  defining uniform penalties, fees, and interest rates;
    
    (12)  determining methods for collecting motor fuel taxes and for collecting and forwarding motor fuel taxes, other than penalties, due to another jurisdiction;
    
    (13)  the temporary remittal of funds equal to the amount of the taxes and interest due to another jurisdiction but not otherwise collected, subject to appropriation of funds for that purpose;  and
    
    (14)  other provisions to facilitate the administration of the agreement.
    
    (c)  The comptroller may, as required by the terms of an agreement, forward to an officer of another state any information in the comptroller's possession relating to the manufacture, receipts, sale, use, transportation, or shipment of motor fuel by any person.  The comptroller may disclose to an officer of another state the location of officers, motor vehicles, and other real and personal property of users, importers, and exporters of motor fuel.
    
    (d)  An agreement may provide for each state to audit the records of a person based in this state to determine if the motor fuel taxes due each state that is a party to the agreement are properly reported and paid.  An agreement may provide for each state to forward the findings of an audit performed on a person based in this state to each other state in which the person has taxable use of motor fuel, from which the person imports motor fuel into this state, or to which the person exports motor fuel from this state.  For a person who is not based in this state and who has taxable use of motor fuel in this state or an import into or export out of this state, the comptroller may use an audit performed by another state that is a party to an agreement with this state to make an assessment of motor fuel taxes against the person.
    
    (e)  An agreement entered into under this section does not affect the authority of the comptroller to audit any person under any other law.
    
    (f)  An agreement entered into under this section prevails over an inconsistent rule of the comptroller.  Except as otherwise provided by this section, a statute of this state prevails over an inconsistent provision of an agreement entered into under this section.
    
    (g)  The comptroller may segregate in a separate fund or account the amount of motor fuel taxes, other than penalties, estimated to be due to other jurisdictions, motor fuel taxes subject to refund during the fiscal year, licensing fees, and other costs collected under the agreement.  On a determination of an amount held that is due to be remitted to another jurisdiction, the comptroller may issue a warrant or make an electronic transfer of the amount as necessary to carry out the purposes of the agreement.  An auditing cost, membership fee, and other cost associated with the agreement may be paid from interest earned on funds segregated under this subsection.  Any interest earnings in excess of the costs associated with the agreement shall be credited to general revenue.
    
    (h)  The legislature finds that it is in the public interest to enter into motor fuel tax agreements with other jurisdictions that may provide for the temporary remittal of amounts due other jurisdictions that exceed the amounts collected and for cooperation with other jurisdictions for the collection of taxes imposed by this state and other jurisdictions on motor fuel that is imported into or exported out of this state.  The comptroller shall ensure that reasonable measures are developed to recover motor fuel taxes and other amounts due this state during each biennium.
    
    (i)  The comptroller shall attempt to enter into a cooperative agreement with each state that borders this state to provide for the collection of taxes imposed by this state and the bordering state on motor fuel that is imported into this state from or exported from this state to the bordering state.  The comptroller is encouraged to attempt to enter into similar cooperative agreements with states that do not border this state.

    Sec. 162.004.  MOTOR FUEL TRANSPORTATION:  REQUIRED DOCUMENTS.  (a)  A person may not transport in this state any motor fuel by barge, vessel, railroad tank car, or transport vehicle unless the person has a shipping document for the motor fuel that complies with this section.
    
    (a-1)  A terminal operator or operator of a bulk plant shall give a shipping document to the person who operates the barge, vessel, railroad tank car, or transport vehicle into which motor fuel is loaded at the terminal rack or bulk plant rack.
    
    (b)  A shipping document shall contain the following information and any other information required by the comptroller:
    
    (1)  the terminal control number of the terminal or physical address of the terminal or bulk plant from which the motor fuel was received;
    
    (2)  the name of the purchaser;
    
    (3)  the date the motor fuel was loaded;
    
    (4)  the net gallons loaded, or the gross gallons loaded if the fuel was purchased from a bulk plant;
    
    (5)  the destination state of the motor fuel, as represented by the purchaser of the motor fuel or the purchaser's agent; and
    
    (6)  a description of the product being transported.
    
    (c)  In the event of an extraordinary circumstance, including an act of God, that temporarily interferes with the ability to issue an automated machine-generated shipping document, a manually prepared shipping document that contains all of the information required by Subsection (b) shall be substituted for the machine-generated shipping document.
    
    (d)  A terminal operator or bulk plant operator may rely on the representation made by the purchaser of motor fuel or the purchaser's agent concerning the destination state of the motor fuel.  A purchaser is liable for any tax due as a result of the purchaser's diversion of motor fuel from the represented destination state.
    
    (e)  A person to whom a shipping document was issued shall:
    
    (1)  carry the shipping document in the barge, vessel, railroad tank car, or other transport vehicle for which the document was issued when transporting the motor fuel described in the document;
    
    (2)  show the shipping document on request to any law enforcement officer, representative of the comptroller, or other authorized individual, when transporting the motor fuel described;
    
    (3)  deliver the motor fuel to the destination state printed on the shipping document unless the person:
    
    (A)  notifies the comptroller and the destination state, if a diversion program is in place, before transporting the motor fuel into a state other than the printed destination state, that the person has received instructions after the shipping document was issued to deliver the motor fuel to a different destination state;
    
    (B)  receives from the comptroller and destination state, if a diversion program is in place, a diversion number authorizing the diversion;  and
    
    (C)  writes on the shipping document the change in destination state and the diversion number;  and
    
    (4)  give a copy of the shipping document to the person to whom the motor fuel is delivered.
    
    (f)  The purchaser is responsible for paying the applicable destination state taxes along with filing a refund with the origin state.  The supplier may not refund any taxes due to the diversion of a product.
    
    (g)  The person to whom motor fuel is delivered by barge, vessel, railroad tank car, or transport vehicle may not accept delivery of the motor fuel if the destination state shown on the shipping document for the motor fuel is a state other than this state, except that the person may accept that delivery if the document contains a diversion number authorized by the comptroller and destination state, if applicable.  The person to whom the motor fuel is delivered shall examine the shipping document to determine that the destination state is this state, and shall retain a copy of the shipping document at the delivery location or another place until the fourth anniversary of the date of delivery.
    
    (h)  This section does not apply to motor fuel that is delivered into the fuel supply tank of a motor vehicle.

    Sec. 162.005.  CANCELLATION OR REFUSAL OF LICENSE.  (a)  The comptroller may cancel or refuse to issue or reissue a motor fuel license to any person who has violated or has failed to comply with a provision of this chapter or a rule of the comptroller.
    
    (b)  Before a license may be canceled, or the issuance or reissuance refused, the comptroller shall give the license holder or license applicant not less than 10 days' notice of a hearing at the office of the comptroller in Austin or at a specified comptroller's field office, granting the license holder or applicant an opportunity to show cause before the comptroller why the proposed action should not be taken.  If a license is in effect, the license remains in force pending the determination of the show-cause hearing.  Notice must be in writing and may be mailed by United States registered mail or certified mail to the license holder or applicant at the person's last known address, or may be delivered by the comptroller to the license holder or applicant, and no other notice is necessary.  In case of service by mail of a notice required by this chapter, the service is complete at the time of deposit in the United States Post Office.
    
    (c)  The comptroller may prescribe rules of procedure and evidence for the hearings in accordance with Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code.
    
    (d)  If, after the hearing or the opportunity to be heard, the license is canceled or the issuance or reissuance refused by the comptroller, all taxes that have been collected or that have accrued, although the taxes are not then due and payable to the state, except by the provisions of this chapter, shall become due and payable concurrently with the notice of cancellation of the license.  The license holder shall within five days make a report covering the period not covered by preceding reports filed by the license holder and ending with the date of cancellation, and shall remit and pay to the comptroller all taxes that have been collected and that have accrued from the sale, use, or distribution of motor fuel in this state.
    
    (e)  The comptroller may revoke a license if the license holder purchases for export motor fuel on which the tax was not paid under this chapter and subsequently diverts or causes the motor fuel to be diverted to a destination in this state or to any destination other than the originally designated state or country without first obtaining a diversion number.

    Sec. 162.006.  SUMMARY SUSPENSION OF LICENSE.  (a)  The comptroller may suspend a person's license without notice or a hearing for the person's failure to comply with this chapter or a rule adopted under this chapter if the person's continued operation constitutes an immediate and substantial threat to the collection of taxes imposed by this chapter and attributable to the person's operation.
    
    (b)  If the comptroller summarily suspends a person's license, proceedings for a preliminary hearing before the comptroller or the comptroller's representative must be initiated simultaneously with the summary suspension.  The preliminary hearing shall be set for a date that is not later than the 10th day after the date of the summary suspension, unless the parties agree to a later date.
    
    (c)  At the preliminary hearing, the license holder must show cause why the license should not remain suspended pending a final hearing on suspension or revocation.
    
    (d)  Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code, does not apply to a summary suspension under this section.
    
    (e)  To initiate a proceeding to suspend summarily a person's license, the comptroller shall serve notice on the license holder informing the license holder of the right to a preliminary hearing before the comptroller or the comptroller's representative and of the time and place of the preliminary hearing.  The notice must be personally served on the license holder or an officer, employee, or agent of the license holder, or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to the license holder's mailing address as it appears on the comptroller's records.  The notice must state the alleged violations that constitute the grounds for summary suspension.  The suspension is effective at the time the notice is served.  If the notice is served in person, the license holder shall immediately surrender the license to the comptroller or to the comptroller's representative.  If notice is served by mail, the license holder shall immediately return the license to the comptroller.

    Sec. 162.007.  ENFORCEMENT OF LICENSE CANCELLATION, SUSPENSION, OR REFUSAL.  (a)  The comptroller may examine any books and records incident to the conduct of the business of a person whose license has been canceled or suspended on the person's failure to file the reports required by this chapter or to remit all taxes due.  If necessary, the comptroller shall issue an audit deficiency determination for any tax amount due.  If the amount is not paid on or before the 15th day after the deficiency determination becomes final, the bond or other security required under this chapter shall be forfeited.  The demand for payment shall be addressed to both the surety or sureties and the person who owes the delinquency.
    
    (b)  If the forfeiture of the bond or other security does not satisfy the delinquency, the comptroller shall certify the taxes, penalty, and interest delinquent to the attorney general, who may file suit against the person or the person's surety, or both, to collect the amount due.  After being given notice of an order of cancellation or summary suspension, it shall be unlawful for any person to continue to operate the person's business under a canceled or suspended license.  The attorney general may file suit to enjoin the person from operating under the canceled or suspended license until the comptroller reissues a license.
    
    (c)  An appeal from an order of the comptroller canceling or suspending or refusing the issuance or reissuance of a license may be taken to a district court of Travis County by the aggrieved license holder or applicant.  The trial shall be de novo under the same rules as ordinary civil suits, except that:
    
    (1)  an appeal must be perfected and filed within 30 days after the effective date of the order, decision, or ruling of the comptroller;
    
    (2)  the trial of the case shall begin within 10 days after its filing;  and

    (1)  inspect any premises where motor fuel, crude petroleum, natural gas, derivatives or condensates of crude petroleum, natural gas, or their products, methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, or other blending agents are produced, made, prepared, stored, transported, sold, or offered for sale or exchange;
    
    (2)  examine the books and records required to be kept and records incident to the business of any license holder or person required to be licensed, or any person receiving, possessing, delivering, or selling motor fuel, crude oil, derivatives or condensates of crude petroleum, natural gas, or their products, or any blending agents;
    
    (3)  examine and either gauge or measure the contents of all storage tanks, containers, and other property or equipment;  and

The comptroller, a peace officer, an employee of the attorney general's office, an employee of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, or an employee of the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation may take samples of motor fuel from a storage tank or container to:
    
    (1)  determine if the fuel contains hazardous waste or is adulterated; or
    
    (2)  allow the comptroller to determine whether taxes on the fuel have been paid or accounted for to this state.

    Sec. 162.010.  IMPOUNDMENT AND SEIZURE.  (a)  If after examination or other investigation, the comptroller believes that the owner or operator of a motor vehicle or cargo tank, or a person receiving, possessing, delivering, or selling gasoline or diesel fuel, has not paid all motor fuel taxes due, or does not have a valid license entitling that person to possess or transport tax-free motor fuel, the comptroller or peace officer may impound the fuel, the motor vehicle, cargo tank, storage tank, equipment, paraphernalia, or other tangible personal property used for or incident to the storage, sale, or transportation of that motor fuel.  Unless proof is produced within three working days after the beginning of impoundment that the owner, operator, or other person has paid the taxes established by the comptroller to be due on the gasoline or diesel fuel stored, sold, used, or transported and any other taxes due to this state, or that the owner, operator, or other person holds a valid license to possess or transport tax-free motor fuel, the comptroller may demand payment of all taxes, penalties, and interest due to this state, and all costs of impoundment.
    
    (b)  If the owner or operator does not produce the required documentation or required license or pay the taxes, penalties, interest, and costs due within three working days after the beginning of the impoundment, the comptroller may seize the impounded property to satisfy the tax liability.
    
    (c)  The comptroller may seize:
    
    (1)  all motor fuel on which taxes are imposed by this chapter that is found in the possession, custody, or control of any person for the purpose of being sold, transported, removed, or used by the person in violation of this chapter;
    
    (2)  all motor fuel that is removed or is deposited, stored, or concealed in any place with intent to avoid payment of taxes;
    
    (3)  any automobile, truck, tank truck, boat, trailer conveyance, or other vehicle used in the removal or transportation of the motor fuel to avoid payment of taxes;  and
    
    (4)  all equipment, paraphernalia, storage tanks, or tangible personal property incident to and used for avoiding the payment of taxes and found in the place, building, or vehicle where the motor fuel is found.

    Sec. 162.011.  SALE OF SEIZED PROPERTY.  (a)  The comptroller may sell property seized under Section [162.010](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=162.010).
    
    (b)  Notice of the time and place of a sale shall be given to the delinquent person in writing by certified mail at least 20 days before the date set for the sale.  The notice shall be enclosed in an envelope addressed to the person at the person's last known address or place of business.  It shall be deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid.  The notice shall also be published once a week for two consecutive weeks before the date of the sale in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county in which the property seized is to be sold.  If there is no newspaper of general circulation in the county, notice shall be posted in three public places in the county 14 days before the date set for the sale.  The notice must contain a description of the property to be sold, a statement of the amount due, including interest, penalties, and costs, the name of the delinquent, and the further statement that unless the amount due, interest, penalties, and costs are paid on or before the time fixed in the notice for the sale, the property, or as much of it as may be necessary, will be sold at public auction in accordance with the law and the notice.
    
    (c)  At the sale, the comptroller shall sell the property and shall deliver to the purchaser a bill of sale for personal property and a deed for real property sold.  The bill of sale or deed vests the interest or title of the person liable for the amount in the purchaser.  The unsold portion of any property seized may be left at the place of sale at the risk of the person liable for the amount.
    
    (d)  The proceeds of a sale shall be allocated according to the following priorities:
    
    (1)  the payment of expenses of seizure, appraisal, custody, advertising, auction, and any other expenses incident to the seizure and sale;
    
    (2)  the payment of the tax, penalty, and interest;  and
    
    (3)  the repayment of the remaining balance to the person liable for the amount unless a claim is presented before the sale by any other person who has an ownership interest evidenced by a financing statement or lien, in which case the comptroller shall withhold the remaining balance pending a determination of the rights of the respective parties.

    Sec. 162.012.  PRESUMPTIONS.  (a)  A person licensed under this chapter or required to be licensed under this chapter, or other user, who fails to keep a record, issue an invoice, or file a return or report required by this chapter is presumed to have sold or used for taxable purposes all motor fuel shown by an audit by the comptroller to have been sold to the license holder or other user.  Motor fuel unaccounted for is presumed to have been sold or used for taxable purposes.  If an exporter claims an exemption under Section [162.104](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=162.104)(a)(4) or [162.204](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=162.204)(a)(4) and fails to report subsequent tax-free sales in this state of the motor fuel for which the exemption was claimed as required by Section [162.1155](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=162.1155) or [162.2165](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=162.2165), or to produce proof of payment of tax to the destination state or proof that the transaction was exempt in the destination state, the exporter is presumed to have not paid the destination state's tax or this state's tax on the motor fuel and the comptroller shall assess the tax imposed by this chapter on the motor fuel against the exporter.  The comptroller may fix or establish the amount of taxes, penalties, and interest due this state from the records of deliveries or from any records or information available.  If a tax claim, as developed from this procedure, is not paid, after the opportunity to request a redetermination, the claim and any audit made by the comptroller or any report filed by the license holder or other user is evidence in any suit or judicial proceedings filed by the attorney general and is prima facie evidence of the correctness of the claim or audit.  A prima facie presumption of the correctness of the claim may be overcome at the trial by evidence adduced by the license holder or other user.
    
    (b)  In the absence of records showing the number of miles actually operated per gallon of motor fuel consumed, it is presumed that not less than one gallon of motor fuel was consumed for every four miles traveled.  An interstate trucker may produce evidence of motor fuel consumption to establish another mileage factor.  If an examination or audit made by the comptroller from the records of an interstate trucker shows that a greater amount of motor fuel was consumed than was reported by the interstate trucker for tax purposes, the interstate trucker is liable for the tax, penalties, and interest on the additional amount shown or the trucker is entitled to a credit or refund on overpayments of tax established by the audit.

The supplier or permissive supplier is liable for and shall collect the tax imposed by this subchapter from the person who imports the gasoline into this state.  If the seller is not a supplier or permissive supplier, then the person who imports the gasoline into this state is liable for and shall pay the tax.
    
    (c)  A tax is imposed on the removal of gasoline from the bulk transfer/terminal system in this state.  The supplier is liable for and shall collect the tax imposed by this subchapter from the person who orders the removal from the bulk transfer terminal system.
    
    (d)  A tax is imposed on gasoline brought into this state in a motor fuel supply tank or tanks of a motor vehicle operated by a person required to be licensed as an interstate trucker.  The interstate trucker is liable for and shall pay the tax.
    
    (e)  A tax is imposed on the blending of gasoline at the point gasoline blended fuel is made in this state outside the bulk transfer/terminal system.  The blender is liable for and shall pay the tax.

    (e-1)  A tax is imposed on gasoline that is otherwise exempt from taxation under Section [162.104](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=162.104)(a)(4) or (7) if the gasoline is sold into a truck or railcar in this state to a person who does not hold a license under Section [162.105](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=162.105)(1), (2), (3), (4), or (6). The person who sold the gasoline is liable for and shall collect and remit the tax.
    
    (e-2)  A tax is imposed on gasoline that is otherwise exempt from taxation under Section [162.104](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=162.104)(a)(4) or (7) if before export the gasoline is sold in this state to a person who holds a license under Section [162.105](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=162.105)(1), (2), (3), (4), or (6) and the gasoline is delivered to a destination in this state.  The person that redirected the delivery of the gasoline to a destination in this state is liable for and shall pay the tax.
    
    (e-3)  A tax is imposed on gasoline that is otherwise exempt from taxation under Section [162.104](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=162.104)(a)(7) if the gasoline is sold into a marine vessel in this state to a person who does not hold a license under Section [162.105](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=162.105)(1), (2), (3), (4), or (6) unless the exporter of record is licensed under Section [162.105](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=162.105)(1), (2), (3), (4), or (6). The person who sold the gasoline is liable for and shall collect and remit the tax.
    
    (f)  A terminal operator in this state is considered a supplier for the purpose of the tax imposed under this subchapter unless at the time of removal:
    
    (1)  the terminal operator has a terminal operator's license issued for the facility from which the gasoline is withdrawn;
    
    (2)  the terminal operator verifies that the person who removes the gasoline has a supplier's license;  and
    
    (3)  the terminal operator does not have a reason to believe that the supplier's license is not valid.
    
    (g)  In each subsequent sale of gasoline on which the tax has been paid, the amount of the tax shall be added to the selling price so that the tax is paid by each person receiving the gasoline until it is paid ultimately by the person using or consuming the gasoline.
    
    (h)  Gasoline is considered to be used when it is delivered into a fuel supply tank.

    (c)  Except as provided by Subsection (d), the sales price of gasoline stated on an invoice, receipt, or shipping document is presumed to be exclusive of the tax imposed by this subchapter.  The seller or purchaser may overcome the presumption by using the seller's records to show that the tax imposed by this subchapter was included in the sales price.
    
    (d)  Subsection (b) does not apply to a sale of gasoline by a licensed dealer to a person who delivers the gasoline at the dealer's place of business into a fuel supply tank or into a container having a capacity of not more than 10 gallons.

    (c)  The tax imposed under Subsection (a)(3) is also imposed on the ultimate consumer.
    
    (d)  A person who sells gasoline in this state, other than by a bulk transfer, on which tax has not been paid for any purpose other than a purpose exempt under Section [162.104](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=162.104) shall at the time of sale collect the tax from the purchaser or recipient of gasoline in addition to the selling price and is liable to this state for the taxes imposed in the manner provided by this chapter.

    Sec. 162.110.  LICENSES AND TRIP PERMITS;  PERIODS OF VALIDITY.  (a)  The license issued to a supplier, permissive supplier, distributor, importer, exporter, terminal operator, blender, or motor fuel transporter is permanent and is valid during the period the license holder has in force and effect the required bond or security and furnishes timely reports and supplements as required, or until the license is surrendered by the holder or canceled by the comptroller.

    Sec. 162.111.  BOND AND OTHER SECURITY FOR TAXES.  (a)  The comptroller shall determine the amount of security required of a supplier, permissive supplier, distributor, exporter, importer, or blender, taking into consideration the amount of tax that has or is expected to become due from the person, any past history of the person as a license holder under this chapter or its predecessor, and the necessity to protect this state against the failure to pay the tax as the tax becomes due.
    
    (b)  If it is determined that the posting of security is necessary to protect this state, the comptroller may require a license holder to post a bond.  A license holder shall post a bond equal to two times the maximum amount of tax that could accrue on tax-free gasoline purchased or acquired during a reporting period.  The minimum bond is $30,000. The maximum bond is $600,000 unless the comptroller believes there is undue risk of loss of tax revenues, in which event the comptroller may require one or more bonds or securities in a total amount exceeding $600,000.
    
    (c)  A license holder who has filed a bond or other security under this subchapter is entitled, on request, to have the comptroller return, refund, or release the bond or security if in the judgment of the comptroller the person has for four consecutive years continuously complied with the conditions of the bond or other security filed under this subchapter.  However, if the comptroller determines that the revenues of this state would be jeopardized by the return, refund, or release of the bond or security, the comptroller may elect not to return, refund, or release the bond or security and may reimpose a requirement of a bond or other security as the comptroller determines necessary to protect the revenues of this state.
    
    (d)  A bond must be a continuing instrument, must constitute a new and separate obligation in the penal sum named in the bond for each calendar year or portion of a year while the bond is in force, and must remain in effect until the surety on the bond is released and discharged.
    
    (e)  Instead of filing a surety bond, an applicant for a license may substitute the following security:
    
    (1)  cash in the form of United States currency in an amount equal to the required bond to be deposited in the suspense account of the state treasury;
    
    (2)  an assignment to the comptroller of a certificate of deposit in any bank or savings and loan association in this state that is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in an amount at least equal to the bond amount required;  or
    
    (3)  an irrevocable letter of credit to the comptroller from any bank or savings and loan association in this state that is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in an amount of credit at least equal to the bond amount required.
    
    (f)  If the amount of an existing bond becomes insufficient or a security becomes unsatisfactory or unacceptable, the comptroller may require the filing of a new or of an additional bond or security.
    
    (g)  A surety bond or other form of security may not be released until it is determined by examination or audit that a tax, penalty, or interest liability does not exist.  The cash or securities shall be released within 60 days after the comptroller determines that liability does not exist.
    
    (h)  The comptroller may use the cash or certificate of deposit security to satisfy a final determination of delinquent liability or a judgment secured in any action by this state to recover gasoline taxes, costs, penalties, and interest found to be due to this state by a person in whose behalf the cash or certificate security was deposited.
    
    (i)  A surety on a bond furnished by a license holder shall be released and discharged from liability to this state accruing on the bond on the 31st day after the date on which the surety files with the comptroller a written request to be released and discharged.  The request does not relieve, release, or discharge the surety from a liability that already accrued or that accrues before the expiration of the 30-day period.  The comptroller, promptly on receipt of the request, shall notify the license holder who furnished the bond, and unless the license holder, before the expiration date of the existing security, files with the comptroller a new bond with a surety company duly authorized to do business under the laws of this state, or other authorized security, in the amount required by this section, the comptroller shall cancel the license in the manner provided by this chapter.
    
    (j)  The comptroller shall notify immediately the issuer of a letter of credit of a final determination of the license holder's delinquent liability or a judgment secured in any action by this state to recover gasoline taxes, costs, penalties, and interest found to be due this state by a license holder in whose behalf the letter of credit was issued.  The letter of credit allowed as security for the remittance of taxes under this subchapter shall contain a statement that the issuer agrees to respond to the comptroller's notice of liability with amounts to satisfy the comptroller's delinquency claim against the license holder.
    
    (k)  A license holder may request an examination or audit to obtain release of the security when the license holder relinquishes the license or when the license holder wants to substitute one form of security for an existing one.

A supplemental list of additions and deletions shall be made available to the license holders each month.  A current and effective license or the list furnished by the comptroller is evidence of the validity of the license until the comptroller notifies license holders of a change in the status of a license holder.
    
    (b)  A licensed supplier, permissive supplier, or distributor who sells gasoline tax-free to a person whose supplier's, permissive supplier's, or aviation fuel dealer's license has been canceled or revoked under this chapter is liable for any tax due on gasoline sold after receiving notice of the cancellation or revocation.
    
    (c)  The comptroller shall notify all license holders under this chapter when a canceled or revoked license is subsequently reinstated and include in the notice the effective date of the reinstatement.  Sales to the supplier, permissive supplier, or aviation fuel dealer after the effective date of the reinstatement may be made tax-free.

    (d)  If, after a refund is received under Subsection (a) or a credit is taken under Subsection (b), the account on which the refund or credit was based is paid, or if the comptroller otherwise determines that the refund or credit was not authorized by Subsection (a) or (b), the unpaid taxes shall be paid by the distributor receiving the refund or the supplier or permissive supplier taking the credit, plus a penalty of 10 percent of the amount of the unpaid taxes and interest at the rate provided by Section [111.060](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=111.060) beginning on the day the refund was issued.

    Sec. 162.127.  CLAIMS FOR REFUNDS.  (a)  A refund claim must be filed on a form provided by the comptroller, be supported by the original invoice issued by the seller, and contain:
    
    (1)  the stamped or preprinted name and address of the seller;
    
    (2)  the name of the purchaser;
    
    (3)  the date of delivery of the gasoline;
    
    (4)  the date of the issuance of the invoice, if different from the date of fuel delivery;
    
    (5)  the number of gallons of gasoline delivered;
    
    (6)  the amount of tax, either separately stated from the selling price or stated with a notation that the selling price includes the tax;  and
    
    (7)  the type of vehicle or equipment, such as a motorboat, railway engine, motor vehicle, off-highway vehicle, or refrigeration unit or stationary engine, into which the fuel is delivered.
    
    (b)  The purchaser must obtain the original invoice from the seller of the gasoline not later than the 30th day after the date the gasoline is delivered to the purchaser.  If the delivery of gasoline is made through an automated method in which the purchase is automatically applied to the purchaser's account, one invoice may be issued at the time of billing that covers multiple purchases made during a 30-day billing cycle.
    
    (c)  A distribution log filed with the comptroller to support the number of gallons of gasoline removed from a bulk user's own bulk storage must contain the name and address of the bulk user making the delivery stamped or preprinted on it and for each individual delivery from the bulk storage:
    
    (1)  the date of delivery;
    
    (2)  the number of gallons of gasoline delivered;
    
    (3)  the signature of the bulk user;  and

    (d)  A distributor or person who does not hold a license who files a valid refund claim with the comptroller shall be paid by a warrant issued by the comptroller.  For purposes of this section, a distributor meets the requirement of filing a valid refund claim if the distributor designates the gallons of gasoline sold or used that are the subject of the refund claim on the monthly report submitted by the distributor to the comptroller.
    
    (e)  A person who files a claim for a tax refund on gasoline used for a purpose for which a tax refund is not authorized or who files an invoice supporting a refund claim on which the date, figures, or any material information has been falsified or altered forfeits the person's right to the entire amount of the refund claim filed unless the claimant provides proof satisfactory to the comptroller that the incorrect refund claim filed was due to a clerical or mathematical calculation error.
    
    (f)  After examination of the refund claim, the comptroller, before issuing a refund warrant, shall deduct from the amount of the refund the two percent deducted originally by the license holder on the first sale or distribution of the gasoline.

    (b)  If the amount of credit that an interstate trucker is entitled to take under Section [162.125](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=162.125) exceeds the amount of tax due on that reporting period, the excess credit amount may be claimed on any of three successive quarterly returns following the period in which the credit was established, or the interstate trucker may seek a refund from the comptroller on or before the due date of the third successive quarterly return following the period in which the credit was established.  A credit that is not claimed within the period prescribed by this subsection expires.
    
    (c)  If the comptroller assesses a supplier or permissive supplier for a tax-free sale that is taxable, and the supplier or permissive supplier subsequently collects the tax from the purchaser, the purchaser may file a refund claim before the first anniversary of the date the supplier's or permissive supplier's deficiency assessment becomes final if the purchaser used the gasoline in an exempt manner.
    
    (d)  A supplier, permissive supplier, distributor, importer, exporter, or blender that determines taxes were erroneously reported and remitted or that paid more taxes than were due this state because of a mistake of fact or law may take a credit on the monthly tax report on which the error has occurred and tax payment made to the comptroller.

Diesel fuel is considered to be used when it is delivered into a fuel supply tank.
    
    (b)  The tax imposed by this subchapter must be stated separately from the sales price of diesel fuel and identified as diesel fuel tax on the invoice or receipt issued to a purchaser.  Backup diesel fuel tax may be identified as diesel fuel tax.  The tax must be separately stated and identified in the same manner on a shipping document, if the shipping document includes the sales price of the diesel fuel.
    
    (c)  Except as provided by Subsection (d), the sales price of diesel fuel stated on an invoice, receipt, or shipping document is presumed to be exclusive of the tax imposed by this subchapter.

    (c)  The tax imposed under Subsection (a)(3) is also imposed on the ultimate consumer.
    
    (d)  A person who sells diesel fuel in this state, other than by a bulk transfer, on which tax has not been paid for any purpose other than a purpose exempt under Section [162.204](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=162.204) shall at the time of sale collect the tax from the purchaser or recipient of diesel fuel in addition to the selling price and is liable to this state for the taxes imposed in the manner provided by this chapter.

    Sec. 162.205.  PERSONS REQUIRED TO BE LICENSED.  (a)  A person shall obtain the appropriate license or licenses issued by the comptroller before conducting the activities of:
    
    (1)  a supplier, who may also act as a distributor, importer, exporter, blender, motor fuel transporter, or aviation fuel dealer without securing a separate license, but who is subject to all other conditions, requirements, and liabilities imposed on those license holders;
    
    (2)  a permissive supplier, who may also act as a distributor, importer, exporter, blender, motor fuel transporter, or aviation fuel dealer without securing a separate license but who is subject to all other conditions, requirements, and liabilities imposed on those license holders;
    
    (3)  a distributor, who may also act as an importer, exporter, blender, or motor fuel transporter without securing a separate license, but who is subject to all other conditions, requirements, and liabilities imposed on those license holders;
    
    (4)  an importer, who may also act as an exporter, blender, or motor fuel transporter without securing a separate license, but who is subject to all other conditions, requirements, and liabilities imposed on those license holders;

    Sec. 162.206.  STATEMENT FOR PURCHASE OF DYED DIESEL FUEL.  (a)  The first removal of diesel fuel from a terminal in this state is taxable, except the sale of dyed diesel fuel may be made without collecting the tax if the purchaser furnishes to a licensed supplier or distributor a signed statement that includes an end user number issued by the comptroller.  A person who wants to use a signed statement to purchase dyed diesel fuel must apply to the comptroller for an end user number to be used in conjunction with a signed statement.  A licensed supplier or distributor may not make a tax-free sale of any diesel fuel to a purchaser using a signed statement unless the purchaser has an end user number issued by the comptroller under this section.  A taxable sale or removal of dyed diesel fuel may not be made under this chapter, except as prescribed by Subsection (d).
    
    (b)  A sale of dyed diesel fuel may be made without collecting the tax if the purchaser furnishes to a licensed supplier or distributor a signed statement, including an end user number issued by the comptroller, that stipulates that:
    
    (1)  all of the dyed diesel fuel purchased on the signed statement will be consumed by the purchaser and will not be resold;  and
    
    (2)  none of the dyed diesel fuel purchased on the signed statement will be delivered or permitted to be delivered into the fuel supply tank of a motor vehicle operated on the public highways of this state.
    
    (c)  A person may not make a tax-free purchase and a licensed supplier or distributor may not make a tax-free sale to a purchaser of any dyed diesel fuel under this section using a signed statement for the first sale or purchase and for any subsequent sale or purchase  in a calendar month for more than:
    
    (1)  10,000 gallons of dyed diesel fuel;
    
    (2)  25,000 gallons of dyed diesel fuel if the purchaser stipulates in the signed statement that all of the fuel will be consumed by the purchaser in the original production of, or to increase the production of, oil or gas and furnishes the licensed supplier or distributor with a letter of exception issued by the comptroller; or
    
    (3)  25,000 gallons of dyed diesel fuel if the purchaser stipulates in the signed statement that all of the fuel will be consumed by the purchaser in agricultural off-highway equipment.
    
    (c-1)  The monthly limitations prescribed by Subsection (c) apply regardless of whether the dyed diesel fuel is purchased in a single transaction during that month or in multiple transactions during that month.
    
    (d)  Any gallons purchased or sold in excess of the limitations prescribed by Subsection (c) constitute a taxable purchase or sale.   A purchaser that exceeds the limitations prescribed by Subsection (c) shall be required to obtain a dyed diesel fuel bonded user license.
    
    (e)  The signed statement and end user number from the purchaser relieves the licensed supplier or distributor from the burden of proof that the sale of dyed diesel fuel for a nonhighway purpose was not taxable to the purchaser and remains in effect unless:
    
    (1)  the statement is revoked in writing by the purchaser or licensed supplier or distributor;
    
    (2)  the comptroller notifies the licensed supplier or distributor in writing that the purchaser may no longer make tax-free purchases;  or
    
    (3)  the licensed supplier or distributor is put on notice by making taxable sales of dyed diesel fuel to a purchaser who has previously furnished a signed statement to the licensed supplier or distributor.
    
    (f)  For purposes of Subsection (e)(3), a licensed supplier or distributor is not put on notice when taxable sales of dyed diesel fuel are made in accordance with Subsection (d).
    
    (g)  The statement must be signed by the purchaser or the purchaser's representative.
    
    (g-1)  For purposes of this section, the purchaser is considered to have temporarily furnished the signed statement to the licensed supplier or distributor if the supplier or distributor verifies that the purchaser has an end user number issued by the comptroller.  The licensed supplier or distributor shall use the comptroller's Internet website or other materials provided or produced by the comptroller to verify this information until the purchaser provides to the supplier or distributor a completed signed statement.
    
    (h)  The comptroller by rule may allow separate operating divisions of a corporation to give separate signed statements as if the divisions were different legal entities.
    
    (i)  The comptroller may adopt necessary forms and rules to administer and enforce this section.
    
    (j)  A taxable use of any part of the dyed diesel fuel purchased under a signed statement shall, in addition to application of any criminal penalty, forfeit the right of the person to purchase dyed diesel fuel tax-free for a period of one year from the date of the offense.  Any tax, interest, and penalty found to be due through false or erroneous execution or continuance of a promissory statement by the purchaser, if assessed to the licensed supplier or distributor, is a debt of the purchaser to the licensed supplier or distributor until paid and is recoverable at law in the same manner as the purchase price of the fuel. 
    
    (k)  Properly completed signed statements should be in the possession of the licensed supplier or distributor at the time the sale of dyed diesel fuel occurs.  If the licensed supplier or distributor is not in possession of the signed statements within 60 days after the date written notice requiring possession of them is given to the licensed supplier or distributor by the comptroller, exempt sales claimed by the licensed supplier or distributor that require delivery of the signed statements shall be disallowed.  If the licensed supplier or distributor delivers the signed statements to the comptroller within the 60-day period, the comptroller may verify the reason or basis for the signed statements before allowing the exempt sales.  An exempt sale may not be granted on the basis of signed statements delivered to the comptroller after the 60-day period.
    
    (l)  On receipt of notice transmitted by an electronic means of a final judgment entered by a court against a purchaser of dyed diesel fuel for failure to pay an amount owed to a licensed supplier or distributor for the purchase of dyed diesel fuel, the comptroller shall revoke the end user number issued to the purchaser.  The comptroller shall provide the notice described by Subsection (e)(2) to the licensed supplier or distributor if the purchaser's end user number is revoked.
    
    (m)  The comptroller may reinstate an end user number that is revoked under Subsection (l) on receipt of proof transmitted by an electronic means and satisfactory to the comptroller that the purchaser whose end user number was revoked has satisfied the judgment described by Subsection (l), including all costs and other amounts awarded in the judgment.

    (1)  collect the tax due to this state on the diesel fuel;
    
    (2)  waive any defense that this state lacks jurisdiction to require the supplier to collect the tax due to this state on the diesel fuel under this subchapter;

    Sec. 162.211.  LICENSES AND TRIP PERMITS;  PERIODS OF VALIDITY.

    Sec. 162.212.  BOND AND OTHER SECURITY FOR TAXES.  (a)  The comptroller shall determine the amount of security required of a supplier, permissive supplier, distributor, exporter, importer, blender, or dyed diesel fuel bonded user, taking into consideration the amount of tax that has or is expected to become due from the person, any past history of the person as a license holder under this chapter and its predecessor, and the necessity to protect this state against the failure to pay the tax as the tax becomes due. 
    
    (b)  If it is determined that the posting of security is necessary to protect this state, the comptroller may require a license holder to post a bond.  A license holder shall post a bond equal to two times the maximum amount of tax that could accrue on tax-free diesel fuel purchased or acquired during a reporting period.  The minimum bond is $30,000, except that for a dyed diesel fuel bonded user the minimum bond is $10,000. The maximum bond is $600,000 unless the comptroller believes there is undue risk of loss of tax revenues, in which event the comptroller may require one or more bonds or securities in a total amount exceeding $600,000.
    
    (c)  A license holder who has filed a bond or other security under this subchapter is entitled, on request, to have the comptroller return, refund, or release the bond or security if in the judgment of the comptroller the person has for four consecutive years continuously complied with the conditions of the bond or other security filed under this subchapter.  However, if the comptroller determines that the revenues of this state would be jeopardized by the return, refund, or release of the bond or security, the comptroller may elect not to return, refund, or release the bond or security and may reimpose a requirement of a bond or other security as the comptroller determines necessary to protect the revenues of this state.
    
    (d)  A bond must be a continuing instrument, must constitute a new and separate obligation in the penal sum named in the bond for each calendar year or portion of a year while the bond is in force, and must remain in effect until the surety on the bond is released and discharged.
    
    (e)  Instead of filing a surety bond, an applicant for a license may substitute the following security:
    
    (1)  cash in the form of United States currency in an amount equal to the required bond to be deposited in the suspense account of the state treasury;
    
    (2)  an assignment to the comptroller of a certificate of deposit in any bank or savings and loan association in this state that is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in an amount at least equal to the bond amount required;  or
    
    (3)  an irrevocable letter of credit to the comptroller from any bank or savings and loan association in this state that is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in an amount of credit at least equal to the bond amount required.
    
    (f)  If the amount of an existing bond becomes insufficient or a security becomes unsatisfactory or unacceptable, the comptroller may require the filing of a new or additional bond or security.
    
    (g)  A surety bond or other form of security may not be released until it is determined by examination or audit that a tax, penalty, or interest liability does not exist.  The cash or securities shall be released within 60 days after the comptroller determines that liability does not exist.
    
    (h)  The comptroller may use the cash or certificate of deposit security to satisfy a final determination of delinquent liability or a judgment secured in any action by this state to recover diesel fuel taxes, costs, penalties, and interest found to be due to this state by a person in whose behalf the cash or certificate security was deposited.
    
    (i)  A surety on a bond furnished by a license holder shall be released and discharged from liability to this state accruing on the bond on the 31st day after the date the surety files with the comptroller a written request to be released and discharged.  The request does not relieve, release, or discharge the surety from a liability already accrued, or that accrues before the expiration of the 30-day period.  The comptroller, promptly on receipt of the request, shall notify the license holder who furnished the bond, and unless the license holder, before the expiration date of the existing security, files with the comptroller a new bond with a surety company duly authorized to do business under the laws of this state, or other authorized security, in the amount required in this section, the comptroller shall cancel the license in the manner provided by this chapter.
    
    (j)  The comptroller shall notify immediately the issuer of a letter of credit of a final determination of the license holder's delinquent liability or a judgment secured in any action by this state to recover diesel fuel taxes, costs, penalties, and interest found to be due this state by a license holder in whose behalf the letter of credit was issued.  The letter of credit allowed as security for the remittance of taxes under this subchapter shall contain a statement that the issuer agrees to respond to the comptroller's notice of liability with amounts to satisfy the comptroller's delinquency claim against the license holder.
    
    (k)  A license holder may request an examination or audit to obtain release of the security when the license holder relinquishes the license or when the license holder wants to substitute one form of security for an existing one.

    (f)  After examination of the refund claim, the comptroller, before issuing a refund warrant, shall deduct from the amount of the refund the two percent deducted originally by the license holder on the first sale or distribution of the diesel fuel.

    (b)  If the amount of credit that an interstate trucker is entitled to take under Section [162.227](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=162.227) exceeds the amount of tax due on that reporting period, the excess credit amount may be claimed on any of the three successive quarterly returns following the period in which the credit was established or the interstate trucker may file a refund claim with the comptroller on or before the due date of the third successive quarterly return following the period in which the credit was established.  A credit that is not claimed within the period prescribed by this subsection expires.
    
    (c)  If the comptroller assesses a supplier or permissive supplier for a tax-free sale that is taxable, and the supplier or permissive supplier subsequently collects the tax from the purchaser, the purchaser may file a refund claim before the first anniversary of the date the supplier's or permissive supplier's deficiency assessment becomes final if the purchaser used the diesel fuel in an exempt manner.
    
    (d)  A supplier, permissive supplier, distributor, importer, exporter, or blender that determines taxes were erroneously reported and remitted or that paid more taxes than were due to this state because of a mistake of fact or law may take a credit on the monthly tax report on which the error has occurred and tax payment made to the comptroller.  The credit must be taken before the expiration of the applicable period of limitation as provided by Chapter [111](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=111).

    Sec. 162.361.  BOND AND OTHER SECURITY FOR TAXES.  (a)  The comptroller shall determine the amount of security required of a dealer, taking into consideration the amount of tax that has or is expected to become due from the person, any past history of the person as a license holder under this chapter or its predecessor, and the necessity to protect this state against the failure to pay the tax as the tax becomes due.
    
    (b)  The comptroller may require a license holder to post a bond if the comptroller determines it is necessary for the license holder to post security to protect the revenues of this state.  A license holder must post a bond equal to two times the maximum amount of tax that could accrue on compressed natural gas or liquefied natural gas produced, purchased, acquired, sold, or delivered during a reporting period.  The minimum bond for a person described by Section [162.357](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=162.357)(a) is $30,000.

    (c)  A license holder who has filed a bond or other security under this subchapter is entitled, on request, to have the comptroller return, refund, or release the bond or security if in the judgment of the comptroller the person has for four consecutive years continuously complied with the conditions of the bond or other security filed under this subchapter.  However, if the comptroller determines that the revenues of this state would be jeopardized by the return, refund, or release of the bond or security, the comptroller may elect not to return, refund, or release the bond or security and may reimpose a requirement of a bond or other security as the comptroller determines necessary to protect the revenues of this state.
    
    (d)  A bond must be a continuing instrument, must constitute a new and separate obligation in the penal sum named in the bond for each calendar year or portion of a year while the bond is in force, and must remain in effect until the surety on the bond is released and discharged.
    
    (e)  Instead of filing a surety bond, an applicant for a license may substitute the following security:
    
    (1)  cash in the form of United States currency in an amount equal to the required bond to be deposited in a suspense account of the state treasury;
    
    (2)  an assignment to the comptroller of a certificate of deposit in any bank or savings and loan association in this state that is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in an amount at least equal to the bond amount required; or

The comptroller shall release the cash or securities not later than the 60th day after the date the comptroller determines that liability does not exist.
    
    (h)  The comptroller may use the cash or certificate of deposit security to satisfy a final determination of delinquent liability or a judgment secured in any action by this state to recover compressed natural gas or liquefied natural gas taxes, costs, penalties, and interest found to be due to this state by a person on whose behalf the cash or certificate of deposit security was deposited.
    
    (i)  The comptroller shall release and discharge from liability to this state a surety on a bond furnished by a license holder on the 31st day after the date on which the surety files with the comptroller a written request to be released and discharged.  The request does not relieve, release, or discharge the surety from a liability that already accrued or that accrues before the expiration of the 30-day period.  The comptroller, promptly on receipt of the request, shall notify the license holder who furnished the bond, and unless the license holder, before the expiration date of the existing security, files with the comptroller a new bond with a surety company authorized to do business under the laws of this state, or other authorized security, in the amount required by this section, the comptroller shall cancel the license in the manner provided by this chapter.
    
    (j)  The comptroller shall immediately notify the issuer of a letter of credit of a final determination of the license holder's delinquent liability or a judgment secured in any action by this state to recover compressed natural gas or liquefied natural gas taxes, costs, penalties, and interest found to be due this state by a license holder on whose behalf the letter of credit was issued.  The letter of credit allowed as security under this section must contain a statement that the issuer agrees to respond to the comptroller's notice of liability with amounts to satisfy the comptroller's delinquency claim against the license holder.
    
    (k)  A license holder may request an examination or audit to obtain release of the security when the license holder relinquishes the license or when the license holder wants to substitute one form of security for an existing one.
