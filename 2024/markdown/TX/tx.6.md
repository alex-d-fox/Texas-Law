    Sec. 6.03.  BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN LESS POPULOUS COUNTIES. (a)  This section applies only to an appraisal district established in a county with a population of less than 75,000.
    
    (a-1)  The appraisal district is governed by a board of directors. Five directors are appointed by the taxing units that participate in the district as provided by this section.  If the county assessor-collector is not appointed to the board, the county assessor-collector serves as a nonvoting director.  The county assessor-collector is ineligible to serve if the board enters into a contract under Section [6.05](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=6.05)(b) or if the commissioners court of the county enters into a contract under Section [6.24](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=6.24)(b).  To be eligible to serve on the board of directors, an individual other than a county assessor-collector serving as a nonvoting director must be a resident of the district and must have resided in the district for at least two years immediately preceding the date the individual takes office.  An individual who is otherwise eligible to serve on the board is not ineligible because of membership on the governing body of a taxing unit.  An employee of a taxing unit that participates in the district is not eligible to serve on the board unless the individual is also a member of the governing body or an elected official of a taxing unit that participates in the district.
    
    (b)  Members of the board of directors other than a county assessor-collector serving as a nonvoting director serve two-year terms beginning on January 1 of even-numbered years.
    
    (c)  Members of the board of directors other than a county assessor-collector serving as a nonvoting director are appointed by vote of the governing bodies of the incorporated cities and towns, the school districts, the junior college districts, and, if entitled to vote, the conservation and reclamation districts that participate in the district and of the county.  A governing body may cast all its votes for one candidate or distribute them among candidates for any number of directorships.  Conservation and reclamation districts are not entitled to vote unless at least one conservation and reclamation district in the district delivers to the chief appraiser a written request to nominate and vote on the board of directors by June 1 of each odd-numbered year.  On receipt of a request, the chief appraiser shall certify a list by June 15 of all eligible conservation and reclamation districts that are imposing taxes and that participate in the district.
    
    (d)  The voting entitlement of a taxing unit that is entitled to vote for directors is determined by dividing the total dollar amount of property taxes imposed in the district by the taxing unit for the preceding tax year by the sum of the total dollar amount of property taxes imposed in the district for that year by each taxing unit that is entitled to vote, by multiplying the quotient by 1,000, and by rounding the product to the nearest whole number.  That number is multiplied by the number of directorships to be filled. A taxing unit participating in two or more districts is entitled to vote in each district in which it participates, but only the taxes imposed in a district are used to calculate voting entitlement in that district.
    
    (e)  The chief appraiser shall calculate the number of votes to which each taxing unit other than a conservation and reclamation district is entitled and shall deliver written notice to each of those units of its voting entitlement before October 1 of each odd-numbered year.  The chief appraiser shall deliver the notice:
    
    (1)  to the county judge and each commissioner of the county served by the appraisal district;
    
    (2)  to the presiding officer of the governing body of each city or town participating in the appraisal district, to the city manager of each city or town having a city manager, and to the city secretary or clerk, if there is one, of each city or town that does not have a city manager;
    
    (3)  to the presiding officer of the governing body of each school district participating in the district and to the superintendent of those school districts; and
    
    (4)  to the presiding officer of the governing body of each junior college district participating in the district and to the president, chancellor, or other chief executive officer of those junior college districts.
    
    (f)  The chief appraiser shall calculate the number of votes to which each conservation and reclamation district entitled to vote for district directors is entitled and shall deliver written notice to the presiding officer of each conservation and reclamation district of its voting entitlement and right to nominate a person to serve as a director of the district before July 1 of each odd-numbered year.
    
    (g)  Each taxing unit other than a conservation and reclamation district that is entitled to vote may nominate by resolution adopted by its governing body one candidate for each position to be filled on the board of directors.  The presiding officer of the governing body of the unit shall submit the names of the unit's nominees to the chief appraiser before October 15.
    
    (h)  Each conservation and reclamation district entitled to vote may nominate by resolution adopted by its governing body one candidate for the district's board of directors.  The presiding officer of the conservation and reclamation district's governing body shall submit the name of the district's nominee to the chief appraiser before July 15 of each odd-numbered year.  Before August 1, the chief appraiser shall prepare a nominating ballot, listing all the nominees of conservation and reclamation districts alphabetically by surname, and shall deliver a copy of the nominating ballot to the presiding officer of the board of directors of each district.  The board of directors of each district shall determine its vote by resolution and submit it to the chief appraiser before August 15.  The nominee on the ballot with the most votes is the nominee of the conservation and reclamation districts in the appraisal district if the nominee received more than 10 percent of the votes entitled to be cast by all of the conservation and reclamation districts in the appraisal district, and shall be named on the ballot with the candidates nominated by the other taxing units.  The chief appraiser shall resolve a tie vote by any method of chance.
    
    (i)  If no nominee of the conservation and reclamation districts receives more than 10 percent of the votes entitled to be cast under Subsection (h), the chief appraiser, before September 1, shall notify the presiding officer of the board of directors of each conservation and reclamation district of the failure to select a nominee.  Each conservation and reclamation district may submit a nominee by September 15 to the chief appraiser as provided by Subsection (h).  The chief appraiser shall submit a second nominating ballot by October 1 to the conservation and reclamation districts as provided by Subsection (h).  The conservation and reclamation districts shall submit their votes for nomination before October 15 as provided by Subsection (h).  The nominee on the second nominating ballot with the most votes is the nominee of the conservation and reclamation districts in the appraisal district and shall be named on the ballot with the candidates nominated by the other taxing units.  The chief appraiser shall resolve a tie vote by any method of chance.
    
    (j)  Before October 30, the chief appraiser shall prepare a ballot, listing the candidates whose names were timely submitted under Subsections (g) and, if applicable, (h) or (i) alphabetically according to the first letter in each candidate's surname, and shall deliver a copy of the ballot to the presiding officer of the governing body of each taxing unit that is entitled to vote.
    
    (k)  Except as provided by Subsection (k-1), the governing body of each taxing unit entitled to vote shall determine its vote by resolution and submit it to the chief appraiser before December 15. The chief appraiser shall count the votes, declare the five candidates who receive the largest cumulative vote totals elected, and submit the results before December 31 to the governing body of each taxing unit in the district and to the candidates. For purposes of determining the number of votes received by the candidates, the candidate receiving the most votes of the conservation and reclamation districts is considered to have received all of the votes cast by conservation and reclamation districts and the other candidates are considered not to have received any votes of the conservation and reclamation districts. The chief appraiser shall resolve a tie vote by any method of chance.
    
    (k-1)  This subsection applies only to an appraisal district established in a county with a population of 120,000 or more. The governing body of each taxing unit entitled to cast at least five percent of the total votes must determine its vote by resolution adopted at the first or second open meeting of the governing body that is held after the date the chief appraiser delivers the ballot to the presiding officer of the governing body. The governing body must submit its vote to the chief appraiser not later than the third day following the date the resolution is adopted.
    
    (l)  If a vacancy occurs on the board of directors other than a vacancy in the position held by a county assessor-collector serving as a nonvoting director, each taxing unit that is entitled to vote by this section may nominate by resolution adopted by its governing body a candidate to fill the vacancy.  The unit shall submit the name of its nominee to the chief appraiser within 45 days after notification from the board of directors of the existence of the vacancy, and the chief appraiser shall prepare and deliver to the board of directors within the next five days a list of the nominees.  The board of directors shall elect by majority vote of its members one of the nominees to fill the vacancy.

    (c)  The appraisal district is governed by a board of nine directors.  Five directors are appointed by the taxing units that participate in the district in the manner prescribed by Section [6.03](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=6.03).  Three directors are elected by majority vote at the general election for state and county officers by the voters of the county in which the district is established.  The county assessor-collector serves as an ex officio director.
    
    (d)  To be eligible to serve on the board of directors, an individual other than the county assessor-collector must be a resident of the district and must have resided in the district for at least two years immediately preceding the date the individual takes office.  An individual who is otherwise eligible to serve on the board is not ineligible because of membership on the governing body of a taxing unit.  An employee of a taxing unit that participates in the district is not eligible to serve on the board unless the individual is also a member of the governing body or an elected official of a taxing unit that participates in the district.
    
    (e)  Members of the board of directors appointed by the taxing units participating in the district serve staggered four-year terms beginning on January 1 of every other even-numbered year.

    (g)  If a vacancy occurs in an elective position on the board of directors, the board of directors shall appoint by majority vote of its members a person to fill the vacancy.  A person appointed to fill a vacancy in an elective position must have the qualifications required of a director elected at a general election.

(a)  The board of directors of an appraisal district, by resolution adopted and delivered to each taxing unit participating in the district before August 15, may increase the number of members on the board of directors of the district to not more than 13, change the method or procedure for appointing the members, or both, unless the governing body of a taxing unit that is entitled to vote on the appointment of board members adopts a resolution opposing the change, and files it with the board of directors before September 1.  If a change is rejected, the board shall notify, in writing, each taxing unit participating in the district before September 15.
    
    (b)  The taxing units participating in an appraisal district may increase the number of members on the board of directors of the district to not more than 13, change the method or procedure for appointing the members, or both, if the governing bodies of three-fourths of the taxing units that are entitled to vote on the appointment of board members adopt resolutions providing for the change.  However, a change under this subsection is not valid if it reduces the voting entitlement of one or more taxing units that do not adopt a resolution proposing it to less than a majority of the voting entitlement under Section [6.03](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=6.03) of this code or if it reduces the voting entitlement of any taxing unit that does not adopt a resolution proposing it to less than 50 percent of its voting entitlement under Section [6.03](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=6.03) of this code and if that taxing unit's allocation of the budget is not reduced to the same proportional percentage amount, or if it expands the types of taxing units that are entitled to vote on appointment of board members.
    
    (b-1)  If an appraisal district increases the number of members on the board of directors of the district or changes the method or procedure for appointing the members as provided by this section, the board of directors by resolution shall provide for the junior college districts that participate in the appraisal district to collectively participate in the selection of directors in the same manner as the school district that imposes the lowest total dollar amount of property taxes in the appraisal district among all of the school districts with representation in the appraisal district.  A resolution adopted under this section is not subject to rejection by a resolution opposing the change filed with the board of directors by a taxing unit under Subsection (a).
    
    (c)  An official copy of a resolution under this section must be filed with the chief appraiser of the appraisal district after June 30 and before October 1 of a year in which board members are appointed or the resolution is ineffective.
    
    (d)  Before October 5 of each year in which board members are appointed, the chief appraiser shall determine whether a sufficient number of eligible taxing units have filed valid resolutions proposing a change for the change to take effect.  The chief appraiser shall notify each taxing unit participating in the district of each change that is adopted before October 10.
    
    (e)  A change in membership or selection made as provided by this section remains in effect until changed in a manner provided by this section or rescinded by resolution of a majority of the governing bodies that are entitled to vote on appointment of board members under Section [6.03](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=6.03) of this code.
    
    (f)  A provision of Section [6.03](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=6.03) of this code that is subject to change under this section but is not expressly changed by resolution of a sufficient number of eligible taxing units remains in effect.

    (1)  a conservation and reclamation district has filed a request to the chief appraiser to nominate and vote on directors in the current year as provided by Section [6.03](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=6.03)(c);  or

Each taxing unit is entitled to the same number of votes in the recall as it cast for that member in the appointment of the board.  The governing body of the taxing unit calling for the recall may cast its votes in favor of the recall in the same resolution in which it called for the recall.
    
    (c)  Not later than the 10th day after the last day provided by this section for voting in favor of the recall, the chief appraiser shall count the votes cast in favor of the recall.  If the number of votes in favor of the recall equals or exceeds a majority of the votes cast for the member in the appointment of the board, the member is recalled and ceases to be a member of the board.  The chief appraiser shall immediately notify in writing the presiding officer of the appraisal district board of directors and of the governing body of each taxing unit that voted in the recall election of the outcome of the recall election.  If the presiding officer of the appraisal district board of directors is the member whose recall was voted on, the chief appraiser shall also notify the secretary of the appraisal district board of directors of the outcome of the recall election.
    
    (d)  If a vacancy occurs on the board of directors after the recall of a member of the board under this section, the taxing units that were entitled to vote in the recall election shall appoint a new board member.  Each taxing unit is entitled to the same number of votes as it originally cast to appoint the recalled board member.  Each taxing unit entitled to vote may nominate one candidate by resolution adopted by its governing body.  The presiding officer of the governing body of the unit shall submit the name of the unit's nominee to the chief appraiser on or before the 30th day after the date it receives notification from the chief appraiser of the result of the recall election.  On or before the 15th day after the last day provided for a nomination to be submitted, the chief appraiser shall prepare a ballot, listing the candidates nominated alphabetically according to each candidate's surname, and shall deliver a copy of the ballot to the presiding officer of the governing body of each taxing unit that is entitled to vote.  On or before the 15th day after the date on which a taxing unit's ballot is delivered, the governing body of the taxing unit shall determine its vote by resolution and submit it to the chief appraiser.  On or before the 15th day after the last day on which a taxing unit may vote, the chief appraiser shall count the votes, declare the candidate who received the largest vote total appointed, and submit the results to the presiding officer of the governing body of the appraisal district and of each taxing unit in the district and to the candidates.  The chief appraiser shall resolve a tie vote by any method of chance.
    
    (e)  If the board of directors of an appraisal district is appointed by a method or procedure adopted under Section [6.031](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=6.031) of this code, the governing bodies of the taxing units that voted for or otherwise participated in the appointment of a member of the board may recall that member and appoint a new member to the vacancy by any method adopted by resolution of a majority of those governing bodies.  If the appointment was by election, the method of recall and of appointing a new member to the vacancy is not valid unless it provides that each taxing unit is entitled to the same number of votes in the recall and in the appointment to fill the vacancy as it originally cast for the member being recalled.

    Sec. 6.034.  OPTIONAL STAGGERED TERMS FOR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  (a)  The taxing units participating in an appraisal district may provide that the terms of the appointed members of the board of directors be staggered if the governing bodies of at least three-fourths of the taxing units that are entitled to vote on the appointment of board members adopt resolutions providing for the staggered terms.  A change to staggered terms may be adopted only if the method or procedure for appointing board members is changed under Section [6.031](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=6.031) of this code to eliminate or have the effect of eliminating cumulative voting for board members as provided by Section [6.03](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=6.03) of this code.  A change to staggered terms may be proposed concurrently with a change that eliminates or has the effect of eliminating cumulative voting.
    
    (b)  An official copy of a resolution providing for staggered terms adopted by the governing body of a taxing unit must be filed with the chief appraiser of the appraisal district after June 30 and before October 1 of a year in which board members are to be appointed, or the resolution is ineffective.
    
    (c)  Before October 5 of each year in which board members are to be appointed, the chief appraiser shall determine whether a sufficient number of taxing units have filed valid resolutions proposing a change to staggered terms for the change to take effect.  Before October 10 the chief appraiser shall notify each taxing unit participating in the district of a change that is adopted under this section.
    
    (d)  A change to staggered terms made under this section becomes effective beginning on January 1 of the next even-numbered year after the chief appraiser determines that the change has been adopted.  The entire board of directors shall be appointed for that year without regard to the staggered terms.  At the earliest practical date after January 1 of that year, the board shall determine by lot which of its members shall serve one-year terms and which shall serve two-year terms in order to implement the staggered terms.  If the board consists of an even number of board members, one-half of the members must be designated to serve one-year terms and one-half shall be designated to serve two-year terms.  If the board consists of an odd number of board members, the number of members designated to serve two-year terms must exceed by one the number of members designated to serve one-year terms.
    
    (e)  After the staggered terms have been implemented as provided by Subsection (d) of this section, the appraisal district shall appoint annually for terms to begin on January 1 of each year a number of board members equal to the number of board members whose terms expire on that January 1, unless a change in the total number of board members is adopted under Section [6.031](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=6.031) of this code to take effect on that January 1.
    
    (f)  If a change in the number of directors is adopted under Section [6.031](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=6.031) of this code in an appraisal district that has adopted staggered terms for board members, the change must specify how many members' terms are to begin in even-numbered years and how many members' terms are to begin in odd-numbered years.  The change may not provide that the number of members whose terms are to begin in even-numbered years differs by more than one from the number of members whose terms are to begin in odd-numbered years.
    
    (g)  A change to staggered terms made as provided by this section may be rescinded by resolution of a majority of the governing bodies that are entitled to vote on appointment of board members under Section [6.03](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=6.03) of this code.  To be effective, a resolution providing for the rescission must be adopted by the governing body and filed with the chief appraiser after June 30 and before October 1 of an odd-numbered year.  If the required number of resolutions are filed during that period, the chief appraiser shall notify each taxing unit participating in the district that the rescission is adopted.  If the rescission is adopted, the terms of all members of the board serving at the time of the adoption expire on January 1 of the even-numbered year following the adoption, including terms of members who will have served only one year of a two-year term on that date.  The entire board of directors shall be appointed for two-year terms beginning on that date.
    
    (h)  If an appraisal district that has adopted staggered terms adopts or rescinds a change in the method or procedure for appointing board members and the change or rescission results in a method of appointing board members by cumulative voting, the change or rescission has the same effect as a rescission of the change to staggered terms made under Subsection (g) of this section.
    
    (i)  If a vacancy occurs on the board of directors of an appraisal district that has adopted staggered terms for board members, the vacancy shall be filled by appointment by resolution of the governing body of the taxing unit that nominated the person whose departure from the board caused the vacancy, and the procedure for filling a vacancy provided by Section [6.03](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=6.03) of this code does not apply in that event.

An offense under this subsection is a Class B misdemeanor.
    
    (c)  A chief appraiser commits an offense if the chief appraiser refers a person, whether gratuitously or for compensation, to another person for the purpose of obtaining an appraisal of property, whether or not the appraisal is for ad valorem tax purposes.  An offense under this subsection is a Class B misdemeanor.
    
    (d)  An appraisal performed by a chief appraiser in a private capacity or by an individual related within the second degree by consanguinity or affinity, as determined under Chapter [573](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=573), Government Code, to the chief appraiser may not be used as evidence in a protest or challenge under Chapter [41](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41) or an appeal under Chapter [42](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=42) concerning property that is taxable in the appraisal district in which the chief appraiser is employed.

    Sec. 6.037.  PARTICIPATION OF CONSERVATION AND RECLAMATION DISTRICTS IN APPRAISAL DISTRICT MATTERS.  In this title, a reference to the taxing units entitled to vote on the appointment of appraisal district board members includes the conservation and reclamation districts participating in the appraisal district, without regard to whether the conservation and reclamation districts are currently entitled to do so under Section [6.03](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=6.03)(c).

Otherwise, the conservation and reclamation districts are treated in the same manner as a single taxing unit that is entitled to act but does not take any action on the matter.

A person commits an offense if the person intentionally or knowingly violates this subsection.  An offense under this subsection is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than $100 or more than $1,000.
    
    (g)  The chief appraiser is an officer of the appraisal district for purposes of the nepotism law, Chapter [573](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=573), Government Code.

    (h)  The board of directors of an appraisal district by resolution may prescribe that specified actions of the chief appraiser relating to the finances or administration of the appraisal district are subject to the approval of the board.

    (b-6)  The resolution of a complaint filed under Subsection (b-2) is not an action that a property owner is entitled to:
    
    (1)  protest under Chapter [41](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41);

    Sec. 6.06.  APPRAISAL DISTRICT BUDGET AND FINANCING.  (a)  Each year the chief appraiser shall prepare a proposed budget for the operations of the district for the following tax year and shall submit copies to each taxing unit participating in the district and to the district board of directors before June 15.  He shall include in the budget a list showing each proposed position, the proposed salary for the position, all benefits proposed for the position, each proposed capital expenditure, and an estimate of the amount of the budget that will be allocated to each taxing unit.  Each taxing unit entitled to vote on the appointment of board members shall maintain a copy of the proposed budget for public inspection at its principal administrative office.
    
    (b)  The board of directors shall hold a public hearing to consider the budget.  The secretary of the board shall deliver to the presiding officer of the governing body of each taxing unit participating in the district not later than the 10th day before the date of the hearing a written notice of the date, time, and place fixed for the hearing.  The board shall complete its hearings, make any amendments to the proposed budget it desires, and finally approve a budget before September 15.  If governing bodies of a majority of the taxing units entitled to vote on the appointment of board members adopt resolutions disapproving a budget and file them with the secretary of the board within 30 days after its adoption, the budget does not take effect, and the board shall adopt a new budget within 30 days of the disapproval.
    
    (c)  The board may amend the approved budget at any time, but the secretary of the board must deliver a written copy of a proposed amendment to the presiding officer of the governing body of each taxing unit participating in the district not later than the 30th day before the date the board acts on it.
    
    (d)  Each taxing unit participating in the district is allocated a portion of the amount of the budget equal to the proportion that the total dollar amount of property taxes imposed in the district by the unit for the tax year in which the budget proposal is prepared bears to the sum of the total dollar amount of property taxes imposed in the district by each participating unit for that year.  If a taxing unit participates in two or more districts, only the taxes imposed in a district are used to calculate the unit's cost allocations in that district.  If the number of real property parcels in a taxing unit is less than 5 percent of the total number of real property parcels in the district and the taxing unit imposes in excess of 25 percent of the total amount of the property taxes imposed in the district by all of the participating taxing units for a year, the unit's allocation may not exceed a percentage of the appraisal district's budget equal to three times the unit's percentage of the total number of real property parcels appraised by the district.
    
    (e)  Unless the governing body of a unit and the chief appraiser agree to a different method of payment, each taxing unit shall pay its allocation in four equal payments to be made at the end of each calendar quarter, and the first payment shall be made before January 1 of the year in which the budget takes effect.  A payment is delinquent if not paid on the date it is due.  A delinquent payment incurs a penalty of 5 percent of the amount of the payment and accrues interest at an annual rate of 10 percent.  If the budget is amended, any change in the amount of a unit's allocation is apportioned among the payments remaining.
    
    (f)  Payments shall be made to a depository designated by the district board of directors.  The district's funds may be disbursed only by a written check, draft, or order signed by the chairman and secretary of the board or, if authorized by resolution of the board, by the chief appraiser.
    
    (g)  If a taxing unit decides not to impose taxes for any tax year, the unit is not liable for any of the costs of operating the district in that year, and those costs are allocated among the other taxing units as if that unit had not imposed taxes in the year used to calculate allocations.  However, if that unit has made any payments, it is not entitled to a refund.
    
    (h)  If a newly formed taxing unit or a taxing unit that did not impose taxes in the preceding year imposes taxes in any tax year, that unit is allocated a portion of the amount budgeted to operate the district as if it had imposed taxes in the preceding year, except that the amount of taxes the unit imposes in the current year is used to calculate its allocation.  Before the amount of taxes to be imposed for the current year is known, the allocation may be based on an estimate to which the district board of directors and the governing body of the unit agree, and the payments made after that amount is known shall be adjusted to reflect the amount imposed.  The payments of a newly formed taxing unit that has no source of funds are postponed until the unit has received adequate tax or other revenues.
    
    (i)  The fiscal year of an appraisal district is the calendar year unless the governing bodies of three-fourths of the taxing units entitled to vote on the appointment of board members adopt resolutions proposing a different fiscal year and file them with the secretary of the board not more than 12 and not less than eight months before the first day of the fiscal year proposed by the resolutions.  If the fiscal year of an appraisal district is changed under this subsection, the chief appraiser shall prepare a proposed budget for the fiscal year as provided by Subsection (a) of this section before the 15th day of the seventh month preceding the first day of the fiscal year established by the change, and the board of directors shall adopt a budget for the fiscal year as provided by Subsection (b) of this section before the 15th day of the fourth month preceding the first day of the fiscal year established by the change.  Unless the appraisal district adopts a different method of allocation under Section [6.061](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=6.061) of this code, the allocation of the budget to each taxing unit shall be calculated as provided by Subsection (d) of this section using the amount of property taxes imposed by each participating taxing unit in the most recent tax year preceding the fiscal year established by the change for which the necessary information is available.  Each taxing unit shall pay its allocation as provided by Subsection (e) of this section, except that the first payment shall be made before the first day of the fiscal year established by the change and subsequent payments shall be made quarterly.  In the year in which a change in the fiscal year occurs, the budget that takes effect on January 1 of that year may be amended as necessary as provided by Subsection (c) of this section in order to accomplish the change in fiscal years.
    
    (j)  If the total amount of the payments made or due to be made by the taxing units participating in an appraisal district exceeds the amount actually spent or obligated to be spent during the fiscal year for which the payments were made, the chief appraiser shall credit the excess amount against each taxing unit's allocated payments for the following year in proportion to the amount of each unit's budget allocation for the fiscal year for which the payments were made.  If a taxing unit that paid its allocated amount is not allocated a portion of the district's budget for the following fiscal year, the chief appraiser shall refund to the taxing unit its proportionate share of the excess funds not later than the 150th day after the end of the fiscal year for which the payments were made.
    
    (k)  For good cause shown, the board of directors may waive the penalty and interest on a delinquent payment under Subsection (e).
