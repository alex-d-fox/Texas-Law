    Sec. 41.4115.  FORFEITURE OF REMEDY FOR NONPAYMENT OF TAXES.  (a)  The pendency of a protest under Section [41.411](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41.411) does not affect the delinquency date for the taxes on the property subject to the protest.  However, that delinquency date applies only to the amount of taxes required to be paid under Subsection (b) and, for purposes of Subsection (b), that delinquency date is postponed to the 125th day after the date one or more taxing units first delivered written notice of the taxes due on the property, as determined by the appraisal review board at a hearing under Section [41.44](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41.44)(c-3).  If the property owner complies with Subsection (b), the delinquency date for any additional amount of taxes due on the property is determined in the manner provided by Section [42.42](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=42.42)(c) for the determination of the delinquency date for additional taxes finally determined to be due in an appeal under Chapter [42](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=42), and that additional amount is not delinquent before that date.
    
    (b)  Except as provided in Subsection (d), a property owner who files a protest under Section [41.411](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41.411) must pay the amount of taxes due on the portion of the taxable value of the property subject to the protest that is not in dispute before the delinquency date or the property owner forfeits the right to proceed to a final determination of the protest.
    
    (c)  A property owner who pays an amount of taxes greater than that required by Subsection (b) does not forfeit the property owner's right to a final determination of the protest by making the payment.  If the property owner files a timely protest under Section [41.411](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41.411), taxes paid on the property are considered paid under protest, even if paid before the protest is filed.
    
    (d)  After filing an oath of inability to pay the taxes at issue, a property owner may be excused from the requirement of prepayment of tax as a prerequisite to the determination of a protest if the appraisal review board, after notice and hearing, finds that such prepayment would constitute an unreasonable restraint on the property owner's right of access to the board.  On the motion of a party, the board shall hold a hearing to review and determine compliance with this section, and the reviewing board may set such terms and conditions on any grant of relief as may be reasonably required by the circumstances.  If the board determines that the property owner has not substantially complied with this section, the board shall dismiss the pending protest.  If the board determines that the property owner has substantially but not fully complied with this section, the board shall dismiss the pending protest unless the property owner fully complies with the board's determination within 30 days of the determination.

    Sec. 41.413.  PROTEST BY PERSON LEASING PROPERTY.  (a)  A person leasing tangible personal property who is contractually obligated to reimburse the property owner for taxes imposed on the property is entitled to protest before the appraisal review board a determination of the appraised value of the property if the property owner does not file a protest relating to the property.
    
    (b)  A person leasing real property who is contractually obligated to reimburse the property owner for taxes imposed on the property is entitled to protest before the appraisal review board a determination of the appraised value of the property if the property owner does not file a protest relating to the property.  The protest provided by this subsection is limited to a single protest by either the property owner or the lessee.
    
    (c)  A person bringing a protest under this section is considered the owner of the property for purposes of the protest.  The appraisal review board shall deliver a copy of any notice relating to the protest and of the order determining the protest to the owner of the property and the person bringing the protest.
    
    (d)  An owner of real property shall send to a person leasing property under a contract described by Subsection (b) a copy of any notice of appraised value of the property received by the property owner.  The property owner must send the notice not later than the 10th day after the date the property owner receives the notice.  Failure of the property owner to send a copy of the notice to the person leasing the property does not affect the time within which the person leasing the property may protest the appraised value.  This subsection does not apply if the property owner and the person leasing the property have agreed in the contract to waive the requirements of this subsection or that the person leasing the property will not protest the appraised value of the property.
    
    (e)  A person leasing real property under a contract described by Subsection (b) may request that the chief appraiser of the appraisal district in which the property is located send the notice described by Subsection (d) to the person.  Except as provided by Subsection (f), the chief appraiser shall send the notice to the person leasing the property not later than the fifth day after the date the notice is sent to the property owner if the person demonstrates that the person is contractually obligated to reimburse the property owner for the taxes imposed on the property.
    
    (f)  A chief appraiser who receives a request under Subsection (e) is not required to send the notice requested under that subsection if the appraisal district in which the property that is the subject of the notice is located posts the appraised value of the property on the district's Internet website not later than the fifth day after the date the notice is sent to the property owner.
    
    (g)  A person leasing property under a contract described by this section may designate another person to act as the agent of the lessee for any purpose under this title. The lessee must make the designation in the manner provided by Section [1.111](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=1.111). An agent designated under this subsection has the same authority and is subject to the same limitations as an agent designated by a property owner under Section [1.111](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=1.111).

    (d)  If the property owner fails to deliver, before the date of the hearing, a rendition statement or property report required by Chapter [22](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=22) or a response to the chief appraiser's request for information under Section [22.07](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=22.07)(c), the property owner has the burden of establishing the value of the property by a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing.  If the property owner fails to meet that standard, the protest shall be determined in favor of the appraisal district.

    Sec. 41.44.  NOTICE OF PROTEST.
    
    (a)  Except as provided by Subsections (b), (c), (c-1), and (c-2), to be entitled to a hearing and determination of a protest, the property owner initiating the protest must file a written notice of the protest with the appraisal review board having authority to hear the matter protested:
    
    (1)  not later than May 15 or the 30th day after the date that notice to the property owner was delivered to the property owner as provided by Section [25.19](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=25.19), whichever is later;
    
    (2)  in the case of a protest of a change in the appraisal records ordered as provided by Subchapter A of this chapter or by Chapter [25](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=25), not later than the 30th day after the date notice of the change is delivered to the property owner;
    
    (3)  in the case of a determination that a change in the use of land appraised under Subchapter C, D, E, or H, Chapter [23](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=23), has occurred, not later than the 30th day after the date the notice of the determination is delivered to the property owner;
    
    (4)  in the case of a determination of eligibility for a refund under Section [23.1243](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=23.1243), not later than the 30th day after the date the notice of the determination is delivered to the property owner; or
    
    (5)  in the case of a protest of the modification or denial of an application for an exemption under Section [11.35](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.35), or the determination of an appropriate damage assessment rating for an item of qualified property under that section, not later than the 30th day after the date the property owner receives the notice required under Section [11.45](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.45)(e).
    
    (b)  A property owner who files his notice of protest after the deadline prescribed by Subsection (a) of this section but before the appraisal review board approves the appraisal records is entitled to a hearing and determination of the protest if he shows good cause as determined by the board for failure to file the notice on time.
    
    (b-1)  Repealed by Acts 2017, 85th Leg., R.S., Ch. 357 (H.B. [2228](http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/85R/billtext/html/HB02228F.HTM)), Sec. 6, eff. January 1, 2018.
    
    (c)  A property owner who files notice of a protest authorized by Section [41.411](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41.411) is entitled to a hearing and determination of the protest if the property owner files the notice prior to the date the taxes on the property to which the notice applies become delinquent.  An owner of land who files a notice of protest under Subsection (a)(3) is entitled to a hearing and determination of the protest without regard to whether the appraisal records are approved.
    
    (c-1)  A property owner who files a notice of protest after the deadline prescribed by Subsection (a) but before the taxes on the property to which the notice applies become delinquent is entitled to a hearing and determination of the protest if the property owner was continuously employed in the Gulf of Mexico, including employment on an offshore drilling or production facility or on a vessel, for a period of not less than 20 days during which the deadline prescribed by Subsection (a) passed, and the property owner provides the appraisal review board with evidence of that fact through submission of a letter from the property owner's employer or supervisor or, if the property owner is self-employed, a sworn affidavit.
    
    (c-2)  A property owner who files a notice of protest after the deadline prescribed by Subsection (a) but before the taxes on the property to which the notice applies become delinquent is entitled to a hearing and determination of the protest if the property owner was serving on full-time active duty in the United States armed forces outside the United States on the day on which the deadline prescribed by Subsection (a) passed and the property owner provides the appraisal review board with evidence of that fact through submission of a valid military identification card from the United States Department of Defense and a deployment order.
    
    (c-3)  Notwithstanding Subsection (c), a property owner who files a protest under Section [41.411](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41.411) on or after the date the taxes on the property to which the notice applies become delinquent, but not later than the 125th day after the property owner, in the protest filed, claims to have first received written notice of the taxes in question, is entitled to a hearing solely on the issue of whether one or more taxing units timely delivered a tax bill.  If at the hearing the appraisal review board determines that all of the taxing units failed to timely deliver a tax bill, the board shall determine the date on which at least one taxing unit first delivered written notice of the taxes in question, and for the purposes of this section the delinquency date is postponed to the 125th day after that date.
    
    (d)  A notice of protest is sufficient if it identifies the protesting property owner, including a person claiming an ownership interest in the property even if that person is not listed on the appraisal records as an owner of the property, identifies the property that is the subject of the protest, and indicates apparent dissatisfaction with some determination of the appraisal office.  The notice need not be on an official form, but the comptroller shall prescribe a form that provides for more detail about the nature of the protest.  The form must permit a property owner to include each property in the appraisal district that is the subject of a protest.  If the form includes boxes a property owner is required to select from to indicate the reason the owner is filing a protest, the form must permit a property owner who believes that the owner's property was appraised at a value that exceeds its appraised value, was appraised unequally, or both, to select a single box to indicate that the owner is filing a protest for either or both reasons.  The form must permit a property owner to request that the protest be heard by a special panel established under Section [6.425](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=6.425) if the protest will be determined by an appraisal review board to which that section applies and the property is included in a classification described by Section [6.425](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=6.425)(b).  The form must permit a property owner to request that the protest be heard by a single-member panel authorized by Section [41.45](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41.45)(b-4). The comptroller, each appraisal office, and each appraisal review board shall make the forms readily available and deliver one to a property owner on request.
    
    (e)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a notice of protest may not be found to be untimely or insufficient based on a finding of incorrect ownership if the notice:
    
    (1)  identifies as the property owner a person who is, for the tax year at issue:
    
    (A)  an owner of the property at any time during the tax year;
    
    (B)  the person shown on the appraisal records as the owner of the property, if that person filed the protest;
    
    (C)  a lessee authorized to file a protest; or
    
    (D)  an affiliate of or entity related to a person described by this subdivision; or
    
    (2)  uses a misnomer of a person described by Subdivision (1).

(a)  On the filing of a notice as required by Section [41.44](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41.44), the appraisal review board shall schedule a hearing on the protest.  The appraisal review board shall schedule the hearing to be held as soon as practicable but not later than the 90th day after the date the board approves the appraisal records as provided by Section [41.12](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41.12). If more than one protest is filed relating to the same property, the appraisal review board shall schedule a single hearing on all timely filed protests relating to the property.  A hearing for a property that is owned in undivided or fractional interests, including separate interests in a mineral in place, shall be scheduled to provide for participation by all owners who have timely filed a protest.
    
    (b)  A property owner initiating a protest is entitled to appear to offer evidence or argument.  A property owner may offer evidence or argument by affidavit without personally appearing and may appear by telephone conference call or videoconference to offer argument.  A property owner who appears by telephone conference call or videoconference must offer any evidence by affidavit.  A property owner must submit an affidavit described by this subsection to the board hearing the protest before the board begins the hearing on the protest.  On receipt of an affidavit, the board shall notify the chief appraiser.  The chief appraiser may inspect the affidavit and is entitled to a copy on request.

    (1)  the property owner notifies the board that the property owner intends to appear by telephone conference call or videoconference in the owner's notice of protest or by written notice filed with the board not later than the 10th day before the date of the hearing; or
    
    (2)  the board proposes that the hearing be conducted by telephone conference call or videoconference and the property owner agrees to the hearing being conducted in that manner.
    
     
    
    Text of subsection as amended by Acts 2021, 87th Leg., R.S., Ch. 644 (H.B. [988](http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/87R/billtext/html/HB00988F.HTM)), Sec. 17
    
      
    
    
     
    
    (b-1)  An appraisal review board shall conduct a hearing on a protest by telephone conference call if the property owner notifies the board that the property owner intends to appear by telephone conference call in the owner's notice of protest or by written notice filed with the board not later than the 10th day before the date of the hearing.
    
    (b-2)  If a property owner elects to have a hearing on a protest conducted by telephone conference call or videoconference, the appraisal review board shall:
    
    (1)  provide:
    
    (A)  a telephone number for the property owner to call to participate in the hearing, if the hearing is to be conducted by telephone conference call; or
    
    (B)  an Internet location or uniform resource locator (URL) address for the property owner to use to participate in the hearing, if the hearing is to be conducted by videoconference; and
    
    (2)  hold the hearing in a location equipped with equipment that allows each board member and the other parties to the protest who are present at the hearing to hear and, if applicable, see the property owner offer argument.
    
    (b-3)  A property owner is responsible for providing access to a hearing on a protest conducted by telephone conference call or videoconference to another person that the owner invites to participate in the hearing.
    
    (b-4)  An appraisal review board shall sit in a single-member panel to conduct a protest hearing under this section if the property owner requests that the hearing be conducted by a single-member panel:
    
    (1)  in the notice of protest; or
    
    (2)  in writing submitted to the board not later than the 10th day before the date of the hearing.
    
    (b-5)  If the recommendation of a single-member panel that conducts a hearing under Subsection (b-4) is not accepted by the appraisal review board, the board may refer the matter for rehearing to a single-member panel composed of a member who did not hear the original protest or the board may determine the protest.
    
    (b-6)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an appraisal review board is not required to conduct a hearing by videoconference if the board:
    
    (1)  is established for a county with a population of less than 100,000; and 
    
    (2)  lacks the technological capability to conduct a videoconference.
    
    (c)  The chief appraiser shall appear at each protest hearing before the appraisal review board to represent the appraisal office.
    
    (d)  This subsection does not apply to a single-member panel established under Subsection (b-4) of this section or a special panel established under Section [6.425](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=6.425).  An appraisal review board consisting of more than three members may sit in panels of not fewer than three members to conduct protest hearings.  If the recommendation of a panel is not accepted by the board, the board may refer the matter for rehearing to a panel composed of members who did not hear the original protest or, if there are not at least three members who did not hear the original protest, the board may determine the protest.
    
    (d-1)  An appraisal review board to which Section [6.425](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=6.425) applies shall sit in special panels established under that section to conduct protest hearings.  A special panel may conduct a protest hearing relating to property only if the property is described by Section [6.425](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=6.425)(b) and the property owner has requested that a special panel conduct the hearing or if the protest is assigned to the special panel under Section [6.425](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=6.425)(f).  If the recommendation of a special panel is not accepted by the board, the board may refer the matter for rehearing to another special panel composed of members who did not hear the original protest or, if there are not at least three other special panel members who did not hear the original protest, the board may determine the protest.
    
    (d-2)  The determination of a protest heard by a panel under Subsection (b-4), (d), or (d-1) must be made by the board.
    
    (d-3)  The board must deliver notice of a hearing or meeting to determine a protest heard by a panel, or to rehear a protest, under Subsection (b-4), (d), or (d-1) in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter.
    
    (e)  On request made to the appraisal review board before the date of the hearing, a property owner who has not designated an agent under Section [1.111](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=1.111) to represent the owner at the hearing is entitled to one postponement of the hearing to a later date without showing cause.  In addition and without limitation as to the number of postponements, the board shall postpone the hearing to a later date if the property owner or the owner's agent at any time shows good cause for the postponement or if the chief appraiser consents to the postponement.  The hearing may not be postponed to a date less than five or more than 30 days after the date scheduled for the hearing when the postponement is sought unless the date and time of the hearing as postponed are agreed to by the chairman of the appraisal review board or the chairman's representative, the property owner, and the chief appraiser.  A request by a property owner for a postponement under this subsection may be made in writing, including by facsimile transmission or electronic mail, by telephone, or in person to the appraisal review board, a panel of the board, or the chairman of the board.  The chairman or the chairman's representative may take action on a postponement under this subsection without the necessity of action by the full board if the hearing for which the postponement is requested is scheduled to occur before the next regular meeting of the board.  The granting by the appraisal review board, the chairman, or the chairman's representative of a postponement under this subsection does not require the delivery of additional written notice to the property owner.
    
    (e-1)  A property owner or a person designated by the property owner as the owner's agent to represent the owner at the hearing who fails to appear at the hearing is entitled to a new hearing if the property owner or the owner's agent files, not later than the fourth day after the date the hearing occurred, a written statement with the appraisal review board showing good cause for the failure to appear and requesting a new hearing.
    
    (e-2)  For purposes of Subsections (e) and (e-1), "good cause" means a reason that includes an error or mistake that:
    
    (1)  was not intentional or the result of conscious indifference; and
    
    (2)  will not cause undue delay or other injury to the person authorized to extend the deadline or grant a rescheduling.
    
    (f)  A property owner who has been denied a hearing to which the property owner is entitled under this chapter may bring suit against the appraisal review board by filing a petition or application in district court to compel the board to provide the hearing.  If the property owner is entitled to the hearing, the court shall order the hearing to be held and may award court costs and reasonable attorney fees to the property owner.
    
    (g)  In addition to the grounds for a postponement under Subsection (e), the board shall postpone the hearing to a later date if:
    
    (1)  the owner of the property or the owner's agent is also scheduled to appear at a hearing on a protest filed with the appraisal review board of another appraisal district;
    
    (2)  the hearing before the other appraisal review board is scheduled to occur on the same date as the hearing set by the appraisal review board from which the postponement is sought;
    
    (3)  the notice of hearing delivered to the property owner or the owner's agent by the other appraisal review board bears an earlier postmark than the notice of hearing delivered by the board from which the postponement is sought or, if the date of the postmark is identical, the property owner or agent has not requested a postponement of the other hearing;  and
    
    (4)  the property owner or the owner's agent includes with the request for a postponement a copy of the notice of hearing delivered to the property owner or the owner's agent by the other appraisal review board.
    
    (h)  Before the hearing on a protest or immediately after the hearing begins, the chief appraiser and the property owner or the owner's agent shall each provide the other with a copy of any written material or material preserved on a portable device designed to maintain a reproduction of a document or image that the person intends to offer or submit to the appraisal review board at the hearing.  Each person must provide the copy of material in the manner and form prescribed by comptroller rule.
    
    (i)  To be valid, an affidavit offered under Subsection (b) must be attested to before an officer authorized to administer oaths and include:
    
    (1)  the name of the property owner initiating the protest;
    
    (2)  a description of the property that is the subject of the protest;  and
    
    (3)  evidence or argument.
    
    (j)  A statement from the property owner that specifies the determination or other action of the chief appraiser, appraisal district, or appraisal review board relating to the subject property from which the property owner seeks relief constitutes sufficient argument under Subsection (i).
    
    (k)  The comptroller shall prescribe a standard form for an affidavit offered under Subsection (b).  Each appraisal district shall make copies of the affidavit form available to property owners without charge.
    
    (l)  A property owner is not required to use the affidavit form prescribed by the comptroller when offering an affidavit under Subsection (b).
    
    (m)  If the protest relates to a taxable leasehold or other possessory interest in real property that is owned by this state or a political subdivision of this state, the attorney general or a representative of the state agency that owns the land, if the real property is owned by this state, or a person designated by the political subdivision that owns the real property, as applicable, is entitled to appear at the hearing and offer evidence and argument.
    
    (n)  A property owner does not waive the right to appear in person at a protest hearing by submitting an affidavit to the appraisal review board or by electing to appear by telephone conference call or videoconference.

If the property owner states in the affidavit that the owner does not intend to appear at the hearing or does not state in the affidavit whether the owner intends to appear at the hearing and has not elected to appear by telephone conference call or videoconference, the board is not required to consider the affidavit at the scheduled hearing and may consider the affidavit at a hearing designated for the specific purpose of processing affidavits.

    Sec. 41.66.  HEARING PROCEDURES.  (a)  The appraisal review board shall conduct hearings in accordance with the hearing procedures adopted by the appraisal review board under Section [41.01](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41.01)(c).  On request made by a property owner in the owner's notice of protest or in a separate writing delivered to the appraisal review board on or before the date the notice of protest is filed, the property owner is entitled to a copy of the hearing procedures.  The copy of the hearing procedures shall be delivered to the property owner not later than the 10th day before the date the hearing on the protest begins and may be delivered with the notice of the protest hearing required under Section [41.46](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41.46)(a).  The notice of protest form prescribed by the comptroller under Section [41.44](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41.44)(d) or any other notice of protest form made available to a property owner by the appraisal review board or the appraisal office shall provide the property owner an opportunity to make or decline to make a request under this subsection.
    
    (b)  Hearing procedures to the greatest extent practicable shall be informal.  Each party to a hearing is entitled to offer evidence, examine or cross-examine witnesses or other parties, and present argument on the matters subject to the hearing.  A property owner who is a party to a protest is entitled to elect to present the owner's case at a hearing on the protest either before or after the appraisal district presents the district's case.
    
    (c)  A property owner who is entitled as provided by this chapter to appear at a hearing may appear by himself or by his agent.  A taxing unit may appear by a designated agent.
    
    (d)  Except as provided by Subsection (d-1), hearings conducted as provided by this chapter are open to the public.
    
    (d-1)  Notwithstanding Chapter [551](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=551), Government Code, the appraisal review board shall conduct a hearing that is closed to the public if the property owner or the chief appraiser intends to disclose proprietary or confidential information at the hearing that will assist the review board in determining the protest.  The review board may hold a closed hearing under this subsection only on a joint motion by the property owner and the chief appraiser.
    
    (d-2)  Information described by Subsection (d-1) is considered information obtained under Section [22.27](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=22.27).
    
    (e)  The appraisal review board may not consider any appraisal district information on a protest that was not presented to the appraisal review board during the protest hearing.
    
    (f)  A member of the appraisal review board may not communicate with another person concerning:
    
    (1)  the evidence, argument, facts, merits, or any other matters related to an owner's protest, except during the hearing on the protest;  or
    
    (2)  a property that is the subject of the protest, except during a hearing on another protest or other proceeding before the board at which the property is compared to other property or used in a sample of properties.
    
    (g)  At the beginning of a hearing on a protest, each member of the appraisal review board hearing the protest must sign an affidavit stating that the board member has not communicated with another person in violation of Subsection (f). If a board member has communicated with another person in violation of Subsection (f), the member must be recused from the proceeding and may not hear, deliberate on, or vote on the determination of the protest.  The board of directors of the appraisal district shall adopt and implement a policy concerning the temporary replacement of an appraisal review board member who has communicated with another person in violation of Subsection (f).
    
    (h)  The appraisal review board shall postpone a hearing on a protest if the property owner or the designated agent of the owner requests additional time to prepare for the hearing and establishes to the board that the chief appraiser failed to comply with Section [41.461](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41.461).  The board is not required to postpone a hearing more than one time under this subsection.
    
    (i)  A hearing on a protest filed by a property owner or the designated agent of the owner shall be set for a time and date certain.  If the hearing is not commenced within two hours of the time set for the hearing, the appraisal review board shall postpone the hearing on the request of the property owner or the designated agent of the owner.
    
    (j)  On the request of a property owner or the designated agent of the owner, an appraisal review board shall schedule hearings on protests concerning up to 20 designated properties to be held consecutively on the same day.  The designated properties must be identified in the same notice of protest, and the notice must contain in boldfaced type the statement "request for same-day protest hearings."  A property owner or the designated agent of the owner may file more than one request under this subsection with the appraisal review board in the same tax year.  The appraisal review board may schedule hearings on protests concerning more than 20 properties filed by the same property owner or the designated agent of the owner and may use different panels to conduct the hearings based on the board's customary scheduling.  The appraisal review board may follow the practices customarily used by the board in the scheduling of hearings under this subsection.
    
    (j-1)  An appraisal review board may schedule the hearings on all protests filed by a property owner or the designated agent of the owner to be held consecutively.  The notice of the hearings must state the date and time that the first hearing will begin, state the date the last hearing will end, and list the order in which the hearings will be held.  The order of the hearings listed in the notice may not be changed without the agreement of the property owner or the designated agent of the owner, the chief appraiser, and the appraisal review board.  The board may not reschedule a hearing for which notice is given under this subsection to a date earlier than the seventh day after the date the last hearing was scheduled to end unless agreed to by the property owner or the designated agent of the owner, the chief appraiser, and the appraisal review board.  Unless agreed to by the parties, the board must provide written notice of the date and time of the rescheduled hearing to the property owner or the designated agent of the owner not later than the seventh day before the date of the hearing.
    
    (j-2)  An appraisal review board must schedule a hearing on a protest filed by a property owner who is 65 years of age or older, disabled, a military service member, a military veteran, or the spouse of a military service member or military veteran before scheduling a hearing on a protest filed by a designated agent of a property owner.
    
    (k)  This subsection does not apply to a special panel established under Section [6.425](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=6.425).  If an appraisal review board sits in panels to conduct protest hearings, protests shall be randomly assigned to panels, except that the board may consider the type of property subject to the protest or the ground of the protest for the purpose of using the expertise of a particular panel in hearing protests regarding particular types of property or based on particular grounds.  If a protest is scheduled to be heard by a particular panel, the protest may not be reassigned to another panel without the consent of the property owner or the designated agent of the owner.  If the appraisal review board has cause to reassign a protest to another panel, a property owner or the designated agent of the owner may agree to reassignment of the protest or may request that the hearing on the protest be postponed.  The board shall postpone the hearing on that request.  A change of members of a panel because of a conflict of interest, illness, or inability to continue participating in hearings for the remainder of the day does not constitute reassignment of a protest to another panel.
    
    (k-1)  On the request of a property owner or the designated agent of the owner, an appraisal review board to which Section [6.425](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=6.425) applies shall assign a protest relating to property described by Section [6.425](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=6.425)(b) to a special panel.  In addition, the chairman of the appraisal review board may assign a protest relating to property not described by Section [6.425](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=6.425)(b) to a special panel as authorized by Section [6.425](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=6.425)(f), but only if the assignment is requested or consented to by the property owner or the designated agent of the owner.  Protests assigned to special panels shall be randomly assigned to those panels.  If a protest is scheduled to be heard by a particular special panel, the protest may not be reassigned to another special panel without the consent of the property owner or the designated agent of the owner.  If the board has cause to reassign a protest to another special panel, a property owner or the designated agent of the owner may agree to reassignment of the protest or may request that the hearing on the protest be postponed.  The board shall postpone the hearing on that request.  A change of members of a special panel because of a conflict of interest, illness, or inability to continue participating in hearings for the remainder of the day does not constitute reassignment of a protest to another special panel.
    
    (l)  A property owner, attorney, or agent offering evidence or argument in support of a protest brought under Section [41.41](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41.41)(a)(1) or (2) of this code is not subject to Chapter [1103](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=1103), Occupations Code, unless the person offering the evidence or argument states that the person is offering evidence or argument as a person holding a license or certificate under Chapter [1103](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=1103), Occupations Code.  A person holding a license or certificate under Chapter [1103](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=1103), Occupations Code, shall state the capacity in which the person is appearing before the appraisal review board.
    
    (m)  An appraisal district or appraisal review board may not make decisions with regard to membership on a panel or chairmanship of a panel based on a member's voting record in previous protests.
    
    (n)  A request for postponement of a hearing must contain the mailing address and e-mail address of the person requesting the postponement.  An appraisal review board shall respond in writing or by e-mail to a request for postponement of a hearing not later than the seventh day after the date of receipt of the request.
    
    (o)  The chairman of an appraisal review board or a member designated by the chairman may make decisions with regard to the scheduling or postponement of a hearing.  The chief appraiser or a person designated by the chief appraiser may agree to a postponement of an appraisal review board hearing.
    
    (p)  At the end of a hearing on a protest, the appraisal review board shall provide the property owner or the designated agent of the owner one or more documents indicating that the members of the board hearing the protest signed the affidavit required by Subsection (g).
    
    (q)  A person who owns property in an appraisal district or the chief appraiser of an appraisal district may file a complaint with the taxpayer liaison officer for the appraisal district alleging that the appraisal review board established for the appraisal district has adopted or is implementing hearing procedures that are not in compliance with the model hearing procedures prepared by the comptroller under Section [5.103](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=5.103) or is not complying with procedural requirements under this chapter.  The taxpayer liaison officer shall investigate the complaint and report the findings of the investigation to the board of directors of the appraisal district.  The board of directors shall direct the chairman of the appraisal review board to take remedial action if, after reviewing the taxpayer liaison officer's report, the board of directors determines that the allegations contained in the complaint are true. The board of directors may refer the matter to the local administrative district judge with a recommendation that the judge remove the member of the appraisal review board serving as chairman of the appraisal review board from that member's position as chairman if the board determines that the chairman has failed to take the actions necessary to bring the appraisal review board into compliance with Section [5.103](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=5.103)(d) or this chapter, as applicable.  If the local administrative district judge agrees with the board's recommendation, the judge shall remove the chairman from that office and appoint another member of the appraisal review board as chairman.
