    CHAPTER 26. ASSESSMENT
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 26.01.  SUBMISSION OF ROLLS TO TAXING UNITS.  (a)  By July 25, the chief appraiser shall prepare and certify to the assessor for each taxing unit participating in the district that part of the appraisal roll for the district that lists the property taxable by the unit.  The part certified to the assessor is the appraisal roll for the unit.  The chief appraiser shall consult with the assessor for each taxing unit and notify each unit in writing by April 1 of the form in which the roll will be provided to each unit.
    
    (a-1)  If by July 20 the appraisal review board for an appraisal district has not approved the appraisal records for the district as required under Section [41.12](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41.12), the chief appraiser shall not later than July 25 prepare and certify to the assessor for each taxing unit participating in the district an estimate of the taxable value of property in that taxing unit.
    
    (b)  When a chief appraiser submits an appraisal roll for county taxes to a county assessor-collector, the chief appraiser also shall certify the appraisal district appraisal roll to the comptroller.  However, the comptroller by rule may provide for submission of only a summary of the appraisal roll.  The chief appraiser shall certify the district appraisal roll or the summary of that roll in the form and manner prescribed by the comptroller's rule.
    
    (c)  The chief appraiser shall prepare and certify to the assessor for each taxing unit a listing of those properties which are taxable by that unit but which are under protest and therefore not included on the appraisal roll approved by the appraisal review board and certified by the chief appraiser.  This listing shall include the appraised market value, productivity value (if applicable), and taxable value as determined by the appraisal district and shall also include the market value, taxable value, and productivity value (if applicable) as claimed by the property owner filing the protest if available.  If the property owner does not claim a value and the appraised value of the property in the current year is equal to or less than its value in the preceding year, the listing shall include a reasonable estimate of the market value, taxable value, and productivity value (if applicable) that would be assigned to the property if the taxpayer's claim is upheld.  If the property owner does not claim a value and the appraised value of the property is higher than its appraised value in the preceding year, the listing shall include the appraised market value, productivity value (if applicable) and taxable value of the property in the preceding year, except that if there is a reasonable likelihood that the appraisal review board will approve a lower appraised value for the property than its appraised value in the preceding year, the chief appraiser shall make a reasonable estimate of the taxable value that would be assigned to the property if the property owner's claim is upheld.  The taxing unit shall use the lower value for calculations as prescribed in Sections [26.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.04) and [26.041](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.041) of this code.
    
    (d)  The chief appraiser shall prepare and certify to the assessor for each taxing unit a list of those properties of which the chief appraiser has knowledge that are reasonably likely to be taxable by that unit but that are not included on the appraisal roll certified to the assessor under Subsection (a) or included on the listing certified to the assessor under Subsection (c).  The chief appraiser shall include on the list for each property the market value, appraised value, and kind and amount of any partial exemptions as determined by the appraisal district for the preceding year and a reasonable estimate of the market value, appraised value, and kind and amount of any partial exemptions for the current year.  Until the property is added to the appraisal roll, the assessor for the taxing unit shall include each property on the list in the calculations prescribed by Sections [26.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.04) and [26.041](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.041), and for that purpose shall use the lower market value, appraised value, or taxable value, as appropriate, included on or computed using the information included on the list for the property.
    
    (e)  Except as provided by Subsection (f), not later than April 30, the chief appraiser shall prepare and certify to the assessor for each county, municipality, and school district participating in the appraisal district an estimate of the taxable value of property in that taxing unit.  The chief appraiser shall assist each county, municipality, and school district in determining values of property in that taxing unit for the taxing unit's budgetary purposes.
    
    (f)  Subsection (e) does not apply to a county or municipality that notifies the chief appraiser that the county or municipality elects not to receive the estimate or assistance described by that subsection.

    Sec. 26.04.  SUBMISSION OF ROLL TO GOVERNING BODY; NO-NEW-REVENUE AND VOTER-APPROVAL TAX RATES.  (a)  On receipt of the appraisal roll, the assessor for a taxing unit shall determine the total appraised value, the total assessed value, and the total taxable value of property taxable by the unit.

This subsection expires December 31, 2024.
    
    (b)  The assessor shall submit the appraisal roll for the taxing unit showing the total appraised, assessed, and taxable values of all property and the total taxable value of new property to the governing body of the taxing unit by August 1 or as soon thereafter as practicable.

    ; and
    
    (2)  "Voter-approval tax rate" means a rate expressed in dollars per $100 of taxable value calculated according to the following applicable formula:

    ; or
    
    (B)  for a taxing unit other than a special taxing unit:
    
    VOTER-APPROVAL TAX RATE = (NO-NEW-REVENUE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS RATE x 1.035) + (CURRENT DEBT RATE + UNUSED INCREMENT RATE)
    
    (c-1)  An officer or employee designated by the governing body of a taxing unit shall calculate the no-new-revenue tax rate and the voter-approval tax rate of the taxing unit for the 2023 tax year as if the changes in law made by S.B. 2, Acts of the 88th Legislature, 2nd Called Session, 2023, were in effect for that tax year.  This subsection expires December 31, 2024.
    
    (c-2)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the assessor for a taxing unit receives a certified estimate of the taxable value of property in the taxing unit under Section [26.01](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.01)(a-1), the officer or employee designated by the governing body of the taxing unit shall calculate the no-new-revenue tax rate and voter-approval tax rate using the certified estimate of taxable value.
    
    (d)  The no-new-revenue tax rate for a county is the sum of the no-new-revenue tax rates calculated for each type of tax the county levies and the voter-approval tax rate for a county is the sum of the voter-approval tax rates calculated for each type of tax the county levies.
    
    (d-1)  The designated officer or employee shall use the tax rate calculation forms prescribed by the comptroller under Section [5.07](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=5.07) in calculating the no-new-revenue tax rate and the voter-approval tax rate.
    
    (d-2)  The designated officer or employee may not submit the no-new-revenue tax rate and the voter-approval tax rate to the governing body of the taxing unit and the taxing unit may not adopt a tax rate until the designated officer or employee certifies on the tax rate calculation forms that the designated officer or employee has accurately calculated the tax rates and has used values that are the same as the values shown in the taxing unit's certified appraisal roll in performing the calculations.
    
    (d-3)  As soon as practicable after the designated officer or employee calculates the no-new-revenue tax rate and the voter-approval tax rate of the taxing unit, the designated officer or employee shall submit the tax rate calculation forms used in calculating the rates to the county assessor-collector for each county in which all or part of the territory of the taxing unit is located.
    
    (e)  By August 7 or as soon thereafter as practicable, the designated officer or employee shall submit the rates to the governing body.

    (B)  the amount by which taxes imposed for debt are to be increased because of the taxing unit's anticipated collection rate; and
    
    (C)  the total of the amounts listed in Paragraphs (A)-(B), less any amount collected in excess of the previous year's anticipated collections certified as provided in Subsection (b).
    
    (e-1)  The tax rate certification requirements imposed by Subsection (d-2) and the notice requirements imposed by Subsections (e)(1)-(3) do not apply to a school district.
    
    (e-2)  The chief appraiser of each appraisal district shall post prominently on the appraisal district's Internet website, if the appraisal district maintains an Internet website, and the assessor for each taxing unit that participates in the appraisal district shall post prominently on the taxing unit's Internet website a notice informing each owner of property located in the appraisal district that the estimated amount of taxes to be imposed on the owner's property by each taxing unit in which the property is located may be found in the property tax database maintained by the appraisal district under Section [26.17](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.17). The notice must include:
    
    (1)  the following statement in bold typeface: "Visit Texas.gov/PropertyTaxes to find a link to your local property tax database on which you can easily access information regarding your property taxes, including information regarding the amount of taxes that each entity that taxes your property will impose if the entity adopts its proposed tax rate. Your local property tax database will be updated regularly during August and September as local elected officials propose and adopt the property tax rates that will determine how much you pay in property taxes.";
    
    (2)  a statement that the property owner may request from the county assessor-collector for the county in which the property is located or, if the county assessor-collector does not assess taxes for the county, the person who assesses taxes for the county under Section [6.24](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=6.24)(b), contact information for the assessor for each taxing unit in which the property is located, who must provide the information described by this subsection to the owner on request;
    
    (3)  the name, address, and telephone number of the county assessor-collector for the county in which the property is located or, if the county assessor-collector does not assess taxes for the county, the person who assesses taxes for the county under Section [6.24](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=6.24)(b); and 
    
    (4)  instructions describing how a property owner may register on the appraisal district's Internet website, if the appraisal district maintains an Internet website, to have notifications regarding updates to the property tax database delivered to the owner by e-mail.
    
    (e-3)  The statement described by Subsection (e-2)(1) must include a heading that is in bold, capital letters in type larger than that used in the other provisions of the notice.
    
    (e-4)  The comptroller:
    
    (1)  with the advice of the property tax administration advisory board, shall adopt rules prescribing the form of the notice required by Subsection (e-2); and
    
    (2)  may adopt rules regarding the format, posting, and publication of the notice.
    
    (e-5)  The governing body of a taxing unit shall include as an appendix to the taxing unit's budget for a fiscal year the tax rate calculation forms used by the designated officer or employee of the taxing unit to calculate the no-new-revenue tax rate and the voter-approval tax rate of the taxing unit for the tax year in which the fiscal year begins.
    
    (e-6)  By August 7 or as soon thereafter as practicable, the chief appraiser of each appraisal district shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation in the county for which the appraisal district is established the notice required by Subsection (e-2).  If there is no newspaper of general circulation in the county for which the appraisal district is established, the notice shall be posted at the appraisal office for the district.
    
    (f)  If as a result of consolidation of taxing units a taxing unit includes territory that was in two or more taxing units in the preceding year, the amount of taxes imposed in each in the preceding year is combined for purposes of calculating the no-new-revenue and voter-approval tax rates under this section.
    
    (g)  A person who owns taxable property is entitled to an injunction prohibiting the taxing unit in which the property is taxable from adopting a tax rate if the assessor or designated officer or employee of the taxing unit, the chief appraiser of the applicable appraisal district, or the taxing unit, as applicable, has not complied with the computation, publication, or posting requirements of this section or Section [26.16](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.16), [26.17](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.17), or [26.18](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.18).  It is a defense in an action for an injunction under this subsection that the failure to comply was in good faith.
    
    (h)  For purposes of this section, the anticipated collection rate of a taxing unit is the percentage relationship that the total amount of estimated tax collections for the current year bears to the total amount of taxes imposed for the current year.  The total amount of estimated tax collections for the current year is the sum of the collector's estimate of:
    
    (1)  the total amount of property taxes imposed in the current year that will be collected before July 1 of the following year, including any penalties and interest on those taxes that will be collected during that period; and
    
    (2)  the total amount of delinquent property taxes imposed in previous years that will be collected on or after July 1 of the current year and before July 1 of the following year, including any penalties and interest on those taxes that will be collected during that period.
    
    (h-1)  Notwithstanding Subsection (h), if the anticipated collection rate of a taxing unit as calculated under that subsection is lower than the lowest actual collection rate of the taxing unit for any of the preceding three years, the anticipated collection rate of the taxing unit for purposes of this section is equal to the lowest actual collection rate of the taxing unit for any of the preceding three years.
    
    (h-2)  The anticipated collection rate of a taxing unit for purposes of this section is the rate calculated under Subsection (h) as modified by Subsection (h-1), if applicable, regardless of whether that rate exceeds 100 percent.
    
    (i)  This subsection applies to a taxing unit that has agreed by written contract to transfer a distinct department, function, or activity to another taxing unit and discontinues operating that distinct department, function, or activity if the operation of that department, function, or activity in all or a majority of the territory of the taxing unit is continued by another existing taxing unit or by a new taxing unit.  The voter-approval tax rate of a taxing unit to which this subsection applies in the first tax year in which a budget is adopted that does not allocate revenue to the discontinued department, function, or activity is calculated as otherwise provided by this section, except that last year's levy used to calculate the no-new-revenue maintenance and operations rate of the taxing unit is reduced by the amount of maintenance and operations tax revenue spent by the taxing unit to operate the department, function, or activity for the 12 months preceding the month in which the calculations required by this chapter are made and in which the taxing unit operated the discontinued department, function, or activity.  If the taxing unit did not operate that department, function, or activity for the full 12 months preceding the month in which the calculations required by this chapter are made, the taxing unit shall reduce last year's levy used for calculating the no-new-revenue maintenance and operations rate of the taxing unit by the amount of the revenue spent in the last full fiscal year in which the taxing unit operated the discontinued department, function, or activity.
    
    (j)  This subsection applies to a taxing unit that had agreed by written contract to accept the transfer of a distinct department, function, or activity from another taxing unit and operates a distinct department, function, or activity if the operation of a substantially similar department, function, or activity in all or a majority of the territory of the taxing unit has been discontinued by another taxing unit, including a dissolved taxing unit.  The voter-approval tax rate of a taxing unit to which this subsection applies in the first tax year after the other taxing unit discontinued the substantially similar department, function, or activity in which a budget is adopted that allocates revenue to the department, function, or activity is calculated as otherwise provided by this section, except that last year's levy used to calculate the no-new-revenue maintenance and operations rate of the taxing unit is increased by the amount of maintenance and operations tax revenue spent by the taxing unit that discontinued operating the substantially similar department, function, or activity to operate that department, function, or activity for the 12 months preceding the month in which the calculations required by this chapter are made and in which the taxing unit operated the discontinued department, function, or activity.  If the taxing unit did not operate the discontinued department, function, or activity for the full 12 months preceding the month in which the calculations required by this chapter are made, the taxing unit may increase last year's levy used to calculate the no-new-revenue maintenance and operations rate by an amount not to exceed the amount of property tax revenue spent by the discontinuing taxing unit to operate the discontinued department, function, or activity in the last full fiscal year in which the discontinuing taxing unit operated the department, function, or activity.

    Sec. 26.0401.  CALCULATION OF CERTAIN TAX RATES FOR 2023 TAX YEAR.  (a)  For the purposes of calculating the no-new-revenue tax rate, the voter-approval tax rate, and any related tax rate for the 2023 tax year, a taxing unit that calculates those rates under a provision of law other than Section [26.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.04) or [26.08](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.08) shall calculate those rates as if the changes in law made by S.B. 2, Acts of the 88th Legislature, 2nd Called Session, 2023, were in effect for that tax year.

    Sec. 26.041.  TAX RATE OF UNIT IMPOSING ADDITIONAL SALES AND USE TAX.  (a)  In the first year in which an additional sales and use tax is required to be collected, the no-new-revenue tax rate and voter-approval tax rate for the taxing unit are calculated according to the following formulas:
    
    NO-NEW-REVENUE TAX RATE = [(LAST YEAR'S LEVY - LOST PROPERTY LEVY) / (CURRENT TOTAL VALUE - NEW PROPERTY VALUE)] - SALES TAX GAIN RATE
    
     and
    
    VOTER-APPROVAL TAX RATE FOR SPECIAL TAXING UNIT = (NO-NEW-REVENUE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS RATE x 1.08) + (CURRENT DEBT RATE - SALES TAX GAIN RATE)
    
    or
    
    VOTER-APPROVAL TAX RATE FOR TAXING UNIT OTHER THAN SPECIAL TAXING UNIT = (NO-NEW-REVENUE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS RATE x 1.035) + (CURRENT DEBT RATE + UNUSED INCREMENT RATE - SALES TAX GAIN RATE)
    
    where "sales tax gain rate" means a number expressed in dollars per $100 of taxable value, calculated by dividing the revenue that will be generated by the additional sales and use tax in the following year as calculated under Subsection (d) by the current total value.
    
    (b)  Except as provided by Subsections (a) and (c), in a year in which a taxing unit imposes an additional sales and use tax, the voter-approval tax rate for the taxing unit is calculated according to the following formula, regardless of whether the taxing unit levied a property tax in the preceding year:
    
    VOTER-APPROVAL TAX RATE FOR SPECIAL TAXING UNIT = [(LAST YEAR'S MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS EXPENSE x 1.08) / (CURRENT TOTAL VALUE - NEW PROPERTY VALUE)] + (CURRENT DEBT RATE - SALES TAX REVENUE RATE)
    
    or
    
    VOTER-APPROVAL TAX RATE FOR TAXING UNIT OTHER THAN SPECIAL TAXING UNIT = [(LAST YEAR'S MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS EXPENSE x 1.035) / (CURRENT TOTAL VALUE - NEW PROPERTY VALUE)] + (CURRENT DEBT RATE + UNUSED INCREMENT RATE - SALES TAX REVENUE RATE)
    
    where "last year's maintenance and operations expense" means the amount spent for maintenance and operations from property tax and additional sales and use tax revenues in the preceding year, and "sales tax revenue rate" means a number expressed in dollars per $100 of taxable value, calculated by dividing the revenue that will be generated by the additional sales and use tax in the current year as calculated under Subsection (d) by the current total value.
    
    (c)  In a year in which a taxing unit that has been imposing an additional sales and use tax ceases to impose an additional sales and use tax, the no-new-revenue tax rate and voter-approval tax rate for the taxing unit are calculated according to the following formulas:
    
    NO-NEW-REVENUE TAX RATE = [(LAST YEAR'S LEVY - LOST PROPERTY LEVY) / (CURRENT TOTAL VALUE - NEW PROPERTY VALUE)] + SALES TAX LOSS RATE
    
    and
    
    VOTER-APPROVAL TAX RATE FOR SPECIAL TAXING UNIT = [(LAST YEAR'S MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS EXPENSE x 1.08) / (CURRENT TOTAL VALUE - NEW PROPERTY VALUE)] + CURRENT DEBT RATE
    
    or
    
    VOTER-APPROVAL TAX RATE FOR TAXING UNIT OTHER THAN SPECIAL TAXING UNIT = [(LAST YEAR'S MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS EXPENSE x 1.035) / (CURRENT TOTAL VALUE - NEW PROPERTY VALUE)] + (CURRENT DEBT RATE + UNUSED INCREMENT RATE)
    
    where "sales tax loss rate" means a number expressed in dollars per $100 of taxable value, calculated by dividing the amount of sales and use tax revenue generated in the last four quarters for which the information is available by the current total value and "last year's maintenance and operations expense" means the amount spent for maintenance and operations from property tax and additional sales and use tax revenues in the preceding year.
    
    (c-1)  Repealed by Acts 2021, 87th Leg., R.S., Ch. 884 (S.B. [1438](http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/87R/billtext/html/SB01438F.HTM)), Sec. 10(3), eff. June 16, 2021.
    
    (d)  In order to determine the amount of additional sales and use tax revenue for purposes of this section, the designated officer or employee shall use the sales and use tax revenue for the last preceding four quarters for which the information is available as the basis for projecting the additional sales and use tax revenue for the current tax year. If the rate of the additional sales and use tax is increased or reduced, the projection to be used for the first tax year after the effective date of the sales and use tax change shall be adjusted to exclude any revenue gained or lost because of the sales and use tax rate change.  If the unit did not impose an additional sales and use tax for the last preceding four quarters, the designated officer or employee shall request the comptroller of public accounts to provide to the officer or employee a report showing the estimated amount of taxable sales and uses within the unit for the previous four quarters as compiled by the comptroller, and the comptroller shall comply with the request.  The officer or employee shall prepare the estimate of the additional sales and use tax revenue for the first year of the imposition of the tax by multiplying the amount reported by the comptroller by the appropriate additional sales and use tax rate and by multiplying that product by .95.
    
    (e)  If a city that imposes an additional sales and use tax receives payments under the terms of a contract executed before January 1, 1986, in which the city agrees not to annex certain property or a certain area and the owners or lessees of the property or of property in the area agree to pay at least annually to the city an amount determined by reference to all or a percentage of the property tax rate of the city and all or a part of the value of the property subject to the agreement or included in the area subject to the agreement, the governing body, by order adopted by a majority vote of the governing body, may direct the designated officer or employee to add to the no-new-revenue and voter-approval tax rates the amount that, when applied to the total taxable value submitted to the governing body, would produce an amount of taxes equal to the difference between the total amount of payments for the tax year under contracts described by this subsection under the voter-approval tax rate calculated under this section and the total amount of payments for the tax year that would have been obligated to the city if the city had not adopted an additional sales and use tax.
    
    (f)  An estimate made by the comptroller under Subsection (d) of this section need not be adjusted to take into account any projection of additional revenue attributable to increases in the total value of items taxable under the state sales and use tax because of amendments of Chapter [151](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=151), Tax Code.
    
    (g)  If the rate of the additional sales and use tax is increased, the designated officer or employee shall make two projections, in the manner provided by Subsection (d), of the revenue generated by the additional sales and use tax in the following year.  The first projection must take into account the increase and the second projection must not take into account the increase.  The designated officer or employee shall then subtract the amount of the result of the second projection from the amount of the result of the first projection to determine the revenue generated as a result of the increase in the additional sales and use tax.  In the first year in which an additional sales and use tax is increased, the no-new-revenue tax rate for the taxing unit is the no-new-revenue tax rate before the increase minus a number the numerator of which is the revenue generated as a result of the increase in the additional sales and use tax, as determined under this subsection, and the denominator of which is the current total value minus the new property value.
    
    (h)  If the rate of the additional sales and use tax is decreased, the designated officer or employee shall make two projections, in the manner provided by Subsection (d), of the revenue generated by the additional sales and use tax in the following year.  The first projection must take into account the decrease and the second projection must not take into account the decrease.  The designated officer or employee shall then subtract the amount of the result of the first projection from the amount of the result of the second projection to determine the revenue lost as a result of the decrease in the additional sales and use tax.  In the first year in which an additional sales and use tax is decreased, the no-new-revenue tax rate for the taxing unit is the no-new-revenue tax rate before the decrease plus a number the numerator of which is the revenue lost as a result of the decrease in the additional sales and use tax, as determined under this subsection, and the denominator of which is the current total value minus the new property value.
    
    (i)  Any amount derived from the sales and use tax that is or will be distributed by a county to the recipient of an economic development grant made under Chapter [381](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=381), Local Government Code, is not considered to be sales and use tax revenue for purposes of this section.
    
    (j)  Any amount derived from the sales and use tax that is retained by the comptroller under Chapters [476](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=476) or [477](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=477), Government Code, is not considered to be sales and use tax revenue for purposes of this section.

    Sec. 26.042.  CALCULATION AND ADOPTION OF CERTAIN TAX RATES IN DISASTER AREA.  (a)  Notwithstanding Sections [26.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.04) and [26.041](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.041), the governing body of a taxing unit other than a school district or a special taxing unit may direct the designated officer or employee to calculate the voter-approval tax rate of the taxing unit in the manner provided for a special taxing unit if any part of the taxing unit is located in an area declared a disaster area during the current tax year by the governor or by the president of the United States and at least one person is granted an exemption under Section [11.35](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.35) for property located in the taxing unit.  The designated officer or employee shall continue calculating the voter-approval tax rate in the manner provided by this subsection until the earlier of:
    
    (1)  the first tax year in which the total taxable value of property taxable by the taxing unit as shown on the appraisal roll for the taxing unit submitted by the assessor for the taxing unit to the governing body exceeds the total taxable value of property taxable by the taxing unit on January 1 of the tax year in which the disaster occurred; or
    
    (2)  the third tax year after the tax year in which the disaster occurred.
    
    (b)  In the first tax year following the last tax year for which the designated officer or employee calculates a taxing unit's voter-approval tax rate in the manner provided by Subsection (a), the taxing unit's voter-approval tax rate is reduced by the taxing unit's emergency revenue rate.  For purposes of this subsection, a taxing unit's emergency revenue rate means a rate expressed in dollars per $100 of taxable value calculated according to the following formula:
    
    EMERGENCY REVENUE RATE = [(LAST YEAR'S ADOPTED TAX RATE - ADJUSTED VOTER-APPROVAL TAX RATE) x LAST YEAR'S TOTAL VALUE] / (CURRENT TOTAL VALUE - NEW PROPERTY VALUE)
    
    (c)  For purposes of Subsection (b), "adjusted voter-approval tax rate" means the voter-approval tax rate a taxing unit would have calculated in the last year for which Subsection (a) applied to the taxing unit if in each tax year Subsection (a) applied to the taxing unit the taxing unit adopted a tax rate equal to the greater of:
    
    (1)  the tax rate actually adopted by the taxing unit for that tax year, if that tax rate was approved by the voters at an election held under Section [26.07](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.07); or
    
    (2)  the taxing unit's voter-approval tax rate for that tax year, calculated in the manner provided for a taxing unit other than a special taxing unit.
    
    (d)  When increased expenditure of money by a taxing unit other than a school district is necessary to respond to a disaster, including a tornado, hurricane, flood, wildfire, or other calamity, but not including a drought, epidemic, or pandemic, that has impacted the taxing unit and the governor has declared any part of the area in which the taxing unit is located as a disaster area, an election is not required under Section [26.07](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.07) to approve the tax rate adopted by the governing body for the year following the year in which the disaster occurs.
    
    (e)  When increased expenditure of money by a school district is necessary to respond to a disaster, including a tornado, hurricane, flood, wildfire, or other calamity, but not including a drought, epidemic, or pandemic, that has impacted the school district and the governor has requested federal disaster assistance for the area in which the school district is located, an election is not required under Section [26.08](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.08) to approve the tax rate adopted by the governing body of the school district for the year following the year in which the disaster occurs.  A tax rate adopted under this subsection applies only in the year for which the rate is adopted.
    
    (f)  If a taxing unit adopts a tax rate under Subsection (d) or (e), the amount by which that rate exceeds the taxing unit's voter-approval tax rate for that tax year may not be considered when calculating the taxing unit's voter-approval tax rate for the tax year following the year in which the taxing unit adopts the rate.
    
    (g)  A taxing unit that in a tax year elects to calculate the taxing unit's voter-approval tax rate under Subsection (a) or adopt a tax rate that exceeds the taxing unit's voter-approval tax rate for that tax year without holding an election under Subsection (d) or (e) must specify the disaster declaration that provides the basis for authorizing the taxing unit to calculate or adopt a tax rate under the applicable subsection.  A taxing unit that in a tax year specifies a disaster declaration as providing the basis for authorizing the taxing unit to calculate or adopt a tax rate under Subsection (a), (d), or (e) may not in a subsequent tax year specify the same disaster declaration as providing the basis for authorizing the taxing unit to calculate or adopt a tax rate under one of those subsections if in an intervening tax year the taxing unit specifies a different disaster declaration as the basis for authorizing the taxing unit to calculate or adopt a tax rate under one of those subsections.

If the election is determined in favor of the imposition of the tax, the designated officer or employee shall subtract from the city's voter-approval and no-new-revenue tax rates the amount that, if applied to the city's current total value, would impose an amount equal to the amount of property taxes budgeted in the current tax year to pay for expenses related to mass transit services.
    
    (b)  In a tax year to which this section applies, a reference in this chapter to the city's no-new-revenue or voter-approval tax rate refers to that rate as adjusted under this section.

    Amount of Increase = Enhanced Indigent Health Care Expenditures / (Current Total Value - New Property Value)
    
    (b)  In each subsequent tax year, if the taxing unit's enhanced indigent health care expenses exceed the amount of those expenses for the preceding year, the no-new-revenue maintenance and operations rate for the taxing unit is increased by the rate computed according to the following formula:

    (c)  To receive an adjustment to the voter-approval tax rate under this section, a political subdivision shall present information to the executive director of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality in a permit application or in a request for any exemption from a permit that would otherwise be required detailing:
    
    (1)  the anticipated environmental benefits from the installation of the facility, device, or method for the control of air, water, or land pollution;
    
    (2)  the estimated cost of the pollution control facility, device, or method; and
    
    (3)  the purpose of the installation of the facility, device, or method, and the proportion of the installation that is pollution control property.
    
    (d)  Following submission of the information required by Subsection (c), the executive director of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality shall determine whether the facility, device, or method is used wholly or partly as a facility, device, or method for the control of air, water, or land pollution. If the executive director determines that the facility, device, or method is used wholly or partly to control pollution, the director shall issue a letter to the political subdivision stating that determination and the portion of the cost of the installation that is pollution control property.
    
    (e)  The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality may charge a political subdivision seeking a determination that property is pollution control property an additional fee not to exceed its administrative costs for processing the information, making the determination, and issuing the letter required by this section. The commission may adopt rules to implement this section.

    (13)  biomass cofiring storage, distribution, and firing systems;
    
    (14)  coal cleaning or drying processes such as coal drying/moisture reduction, air jigging, precombustion decarbonization, and coal flow balancing technology;
    
    (15)  oxy-fuel combustion technology, amine or chilled ammonia scrubbing, fuel or emission conversion through the use of catalysts, enhanced scrubbing technology, modified combustion technology such as chemical looping, and cryogenic technology;

    (g)  The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality by rule shall update the list adopted under Subsection (f) at least once every three years.  An item may be removed from the list if the commission finds compelling evidence to support the conclusion that the item does not render pollution control benefits.
    
    (h)  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, if the facility, device, or method for the control of air, water, or land pollution described in a permit application or in a request for any exemption from a permit that would otherwise be required is a facility, device, or method included on the list adopted under Subsection (f), the executive director of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, not later than the 30th day after the date of receipt of the information required by Subsections (c)(2) and (3) and without regard to whether the information required by Subsection (c)(1) has been submitted, shall determine that the facility, device, or method described in the permit application or in the request for an exemption from a permit that would otherwise be required is used wholly or partly as a facility, device, or method for the control of air, water, or land pollution and shall take the action that is required by Subsection (d) in the event such a determination is made.
    
    (i)  A political subdivision of the state seeking an adjustment in its voter-approval tax rate under this section shall provide to its tax assessor a copy of the letter issued by the executive director of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality under Subsection (d).

    Sec. 26.05.  TAX RATE.  (a)  The governing body of each taxing unit shall adopt a tax rate for the current tax year and shall notify the assessor for the taxing unit of the rate adopted.  The governing body must adopt a tax rate before the later of September 30 or the 60th day after the date the certified appraisal roll is received by the taxing unit, except that the governing body must adopt a tax rate that exceeds the voter-approval tax rate not later than the 71st day before the next uniform election date prescribed by Section [41.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=EL&Value=41.001), Election Code, that occurs in November of that year.  The tax rate consists of two components, each of which must be approved separately.  The components are:
    
    (1)  for a taxing unit other than a school district, the rate that, if applied to the total taxable value, will impose the total amount described by Section [26.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.04)(e)(3)(C), less any amount of additional sales and use tax revenue that will be used to pay debt service, or, for a school district, the rate calculated under Section [44.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=44.004)(c)(5)(A)(ii)(b), Education Code; and
    
    (2)  the rate that, if applied to the total taxable value, will impose the amount of taxes needed to fund maintenance and operation expenditures of the taxing unit for the next year.
    
    (b)  A taxing unit may not impose property taxes in any year until the governing body has adopted a tax rate for that year, and the annual tax rate must be set by ordinance, resolution, or order, depending on the method prescribed by law for adoption of a law by the governing body. The vote on the ordinance, resolution, or order setting the tax rate must be separate from the vote adopting the budget.  For a taxing unit other than a school district, the vote on the ordinance, resolution, or order setting a tax rate that exceeds the no-new-revenue tax rate must be a record vote, and at least 60 percent of the members of the governing body must vote in favor of the ordinance, resolution, or order.  For a school district, the vote on the ordinance, resolution, or order setting a tax rate that exceeds the rate calculated as provided by Section [44.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=44.004)(c)(5)(A)(ii), Education Code, must be a record vote, and at least 60 percent of the members of the governing body must vote in favor of the ordinance, resolution, or order.  A motion to adopt an ordinance, resolution, or order setting a tax rate that exceeds the no-new-revenue tax rate must be made in the following form: "I move that the property tax rate be increased by the adoption of a tax rate of (specify tax rate), which is effectively a (insert percentage by which the proposed tax rate exceeds the no-new-revenue tax rate) percent increase in the tax rate."  If the ordinance, resolution, or order sets a tax rate that, if applied to the total taxable value, will impose an amount of taxes to fund maintenance and operation expenditures of the taxing unit that exceeds the amount of taxes imposed for that purpose in the preceding year, the taxing unit must:
    
    (1)  include in the ordinance, resolution, or order in type larger than the type used in any other portion of the document:
    
    (A)  the following statement: "THIS TAX RATE WILL RAISE MORE TAXES FOR MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS THAN LAST YEAR'S TAX RATE."; and
    
    (B)  if the tax rate exceeds the no-new-revenue maintenance and operations rate, the following statement: "THE TAX RATE WILL EFFECTIVELY BE RAISED BY (INSERT PERCENTAGE BY WHICH THE TAX RATE EXCEEDS THE NO-NEW-REVENUE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS RATE) PERCENT AND WILL RAISE TAXES FOR MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS ON A $100,000 HOME BY APPROXIMATELY $(Insert amount)."; and
    
    (2)  include on the home page of the Internet website of the taxing unit:
    
    (A)  the following statement: "(Insert name of taxing unit) ADOPTED A TAX RATE THAT WILL RAISE MORE TAXES FOR MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS THAN LAST YEAR'S TAX RATE"; and
    
    (B)  if the tax rate exceeds the no-new-revenue maintenance and operations rate, the following statement: "THE TAX RATE WILL EFFECTIVELY BE RAISED BY (INSERT PERCENTAGE BY WHICH THE TAX RATE EXCEEDS THE NO-NEW-REVENUE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS RATE) PERCENT AND WILL RAISE TAXES FOR MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS ON A $100,000 HOME BY APPROXIMATELY $(Insert amount)."
    
    (c)  If the governing body of a taxing unit does not adopt a tax rate before the date required by Subsection (a), the tax rate for the taxing unit for that tax year is the lower of the no-new-revenue tax rate calculated for that tax year or the tax rate adopted by the taxing unit for the preceding tax year.  A tax rate established by this subsection is treated as an adopted tax rate.  Before the fifth day after the establishment of a tax rate by this subsection, the governing body of the taxing unit must ratify the applicable tax rate in the manner required by Subsection (b).
    
    (d)  The governing body of a taxing unit other than a school district may not adopt a tax rate that exceeds the lower of the voter-approval tax rate or the no-new-revenue tax rate calculated as provided by this chapter until the governing body has held a public hearing on the proposed tax rate and has otherwise complied with Section [26.06](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.06) and Section [26.065](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.065).  The governing body of a taxing unit shall reduce a tax rate set by law or by vote of the electorate to the lower of the voter-approval tax rate or the no-new-revenue tax rate and may not adopt a higher rate unless it first complies with Section [26.06](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.06).
    
    (d-1)  The governing body of a taxing unit other than a school district may not hold a public hearing on a proposed tax rate or a public meeting to adopt a tax rate until the fifth day after the date the chief appraiser of each appraisal district in which the taxing unit participates has:
    
    (1)  posted the notice required by Section [26.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.04)(e-2) or published or posted the notice required by Section [26.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.04)(e-6); and
    
    (2)  complied with Section [26.17](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.17)(f).
    
    (d-2)  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), the governing body of a taxing unit other than a school district may not adopt a tax rate until the chief appraiser of each appraisal district in which the taxing unit participates has complied with Subsection (d-1).
    
    (e)  A person who owns taxable property is entitled to an injunction restraining the collection of taxes by a taxing unit in which the property is taxable if the taxing unit has not complied with the requirements of this section or Section [26.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.04).  It is a defense in an action for an injunction under this subsection that the failure to comply was in good faith.  An action to enjoin the collection of taxes must be filed not later than the 15th day after the date the taxing unit adopts a tax rate.  A property owner is not required to pay the taxes imposed by a taxing unit on the owner's property while an action filed by the property owner to enjoin the collection of taxes imposed by the taxing unit on the owner's property is pending.  If the property owner pays the taxes and subsequently prevails in the action, the property owner is entitled to a refund of the taxes paid, together with reasonable attorney's fees and court costs.  The property owner is not required to apply to the collector for the taxing unit to receive the refund.
    
    (e-1)  The governing body of a taxing unit that imposes an additional sales and use tax may not adopt the component of the tax rate of the taxing unit described by Subsection (a)(1) of this section until the chief financial officer or the auditor for the taxing unit submits to the governing body of the taxing unit a written certification that the amount of additional sales and use tax revenue that will be used to pay debt service has been deducted from the total amount described by Section [26.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.04)(e)(3)(C) as required by Subsection (a)(1) of this section.  The comptroller shall prescribe the form of the certification required by this subsection and the manner in which it is required to be submitted.
    
    (f)  Except as required by the law under which an obligation was created, the governing body may not apply any tax revenues generated by the rate described in Subsection (a)(1) of this section for any purpose other than the retirement of debt.
    
    (g)  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), the governing body of a school district that elects to adopt a tax rate before the adoption of a budget for the fiscal year that begins in the current tax year may adopt a tax rate for the current tax year before receipt of the certified appraisal roll for the school district if the chief appraiser of the appraisal district in which the school district participates has certified to the assessor for the school district an estimate of the taxable value of property in the school district as provided by Section [26.01](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.01)(e).  If a school district adopts a tax rate under this subsection, the no-new-revenue tax rate and the voter-approval tax rate of the district shall be calculated based on the certified estimate of taxable value.

    (b)  A petition is valid only if:
    
    (1)  it states that it is intended to require an election on the question of limiting the amount of school district tax funds to be dedicated to the junior college district for the current year;
    
    (2)  it is signed by a number of registered voters of the school district equal to at least 10 percent of the number of registered voters of the school district according to the most recent official list of registered voters;  and
    
    (3)  it is submitted to the governing body on or before the 90th day after the date on which the governing body made the dedication to the junior college district.
    
    (c)  Not later than the 20th day after the day a petition is submitted, the governing body shall determine whether the petition is valid and pass a resolution stating its finding.  If the governing body fails to act within the time allowed, the petition is treated as if it had been found valid.
    
    (d)  If the governing body finds that the petition is valid (or fails to act within the time allowed), it shall order that an election be held in the school district on a date not less than 30 or more than 90 days after the last day on which it could have acted to approve or disapprove the petition.  A state law requiring local elections to be held on a specified date does not apply to the election unless a specified date falls within the time permitted by this section.  At the election, the ballots shall be prepared to permit voting for or against the proposition:  "Limiting the portion of the (name of school district) tax levy dedicated to the (name of junior college district) for the current year to the same portion that was dedicated last year."
    
    (e)  If a majority of the qualified voters voting on the question in the election favor the proposition, the percentage of the total tax levy of the school district for the year to which the election applies dedicated to the junior college district is reduced to the same percentage of the total tax levy that was dedicated to the junior college district by the school district in the preceding year.  If the proposition is approved by a majority of the qualified voters voting in an election to limit the dedication to the junior college district in a year following a year in which there was no dedication of local tax funds to the junior college district under Section [45.105](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=45.105)(e), Education Code, the school district may not dedicate any local tax funds to the junior college district in the year to which the election applies.  If the proposition is not approved by a majority of the qualified voters voting in the election, the percentage of the total tax levy dedicated to the junior college district is the percentage adopted by the governing body.

    Sec. 26.09.  CALCULATION OF TAX.  (a)  On receipt of notice of the tax rate for the current tax year, the assessor for a taxing unit other than a county shall calculate the tax imposed on each property included on the appraisal roll for the unit.
    
    (b)  The county assessor-collector shall add the properties and their values certified to him as provided by Chapter [24](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=24) of this code to the appraisal roll for county tax purposes.  The county assessor-collector shall use the appraisal roll certified to him as provided by Section [26.01](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.01) with the added properties and values to calculate county taxes.
    
    (c)  The tax is calculated by:
    
    (1)  subtracting from the appraised value of a property as shown on the appraisal roll for the unit the amount of any partial exemption allowed the property owner that applies to appraised value to determine net appraised value;
    
    (2)  multiplying the net appraised value by the assessment ratio to determine assessed value;
    
    (3)  subtracting from the assessed value the amount of any partial exemption allowed the property owner to determine taxable value;  and
    
    (4)  multiplying the taxable value by the tax rate.
    
    (c-1)  The assessor for a taxing unit shall calculate the amount of tax imposed by the taxing unit on property for the 2023 tax year as if the changes in law made by S.B. 2, Acts of the 88th Legislature, 2nd Called Session, 2023, were in effect for that tax year and also as if the changes in law made by that Act were not in effect for that tax year.  This subsection expires December 31, 2024.
    
    (d)  If a property is subject to taxation for a prior year in which it escaped taxation, the assessor shall calculate the tax for each year separately.  In calculating the tax, the assessor shall use the assessment ratio and tax rate in effect in the unit for the year for which back taxes are being imposed.  Except as provided by Subsection (d-1), the amount of back taxes due incurs interest calculated at the rate provided by Section [33.01](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=33.01)(c) from the date the tax would have become delinquent had the tax been imposed in the proper tax year.
    
    (d-1)  For purposes of this subsection, an appraisal district has constructive notice of the presence of an improvement if a building permit for the improvement has been issued by an appropriate governmental entity.  Back taxes assessed under Subsection (d) on an improvement to real property do not incur interest if:
    
    (1)  the land on which the improvement is located did not escape taxation in the year in which the improvement escaped taxation;
    
    (2)  the appraisal district had actual or constructive notice of the presence of the improvement in the year in which the improvement escaped taxation; and
    
    (3)  the property owner pays all back taxes due on the improvement not later than the 120th day after the date the tax bill for the back taxes on the improvement is sent.
    
    (d-2)  For purposes of Subsection (d-1)(3), if an appeal under Chapter [41A](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41A) or [42](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=42) relating to the taxes imposed on the omitted improvement is pending on the date prescribed by that subdivision, the property owner is considered to have paid the back taxes due by that date if the property owner pays the amount of taxes required by Section [41A.10](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41A.10) or [42.08](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=42.08), as applicable.
    
    (e)  The assessor shall enter the amount of tax determined as provided by this section in the appraisal roll and submit it to the governing body of the unit for approval.  The appraisal roll with amounts of tax entered as approved by the governing body constitutes the unit's tax roll.

(a)  If the appraisal roll shows that a property is eligible for taxation for only part of a year because an exemption, other than a residence homestead exemption or an exemption described by Subsection (d), applicable on January 1 of that year terminated during the year, the tax due against the property is calculated by multiplying the tax due for the entire year as determined as provided by Section [26.09](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.09) by a fraction, the denominator of which is 365 and the numerator of which is the number of days the exemption is not applicable.
    
    (b)  If the appraisal roll shows that a residence homestead exemption under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13)(c) or (d), [11.132](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.132), [11.133](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.133), or [11.134](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.134) applicable to a property on January 1 of a year terminated during the year and if the owner of the property qualifies a different property for one of those residence homestead exemptions during the same year, the tax due against the former residence homestead is calculated by:
    
    (1)  subtracting:
    
    (A)  the amount of the taxes that otherwise would be imposed on the former residence homestead for the entire year had the owner qualified for the residence homestead exemption for the entire year; from
    
    (B)  the amount of the taxes that otherwise would be imposed on the former residence homestead for the entire year had the owner not qualified for the residence homestead exemption during the year;
    
    (2)  multiplying the remainder determined under Subdivision (1) by a fraction, the denominator of which is 365 and the numerator of which is the number of days that elapsed after the date the exemption terminated; and
    
    (3)  adding the product determined under Subdivision (2) and the amount described by Subdivision (1)(A).
    
    (c)  If the appraisal roll shows that a residence homestead exemption under Section [11.131](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.131) applicable to a property on January 1 of a year terminated during the year, the tax due against the residence homestead is calculated by multiplying the amount of the taxes that otherwise would be imposed on the residence homestead for the entire year had the individual not qualified for the exemption under Section [11.131](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.131) during the year by a fraction, the denominator of which is 365 and the numerator of which is the number of days that elapsed after the date the exemption terminated.
    
    (d)  Subsection (a) does not apply to an exemption for land received by an organization under Section [11.181](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.181), [11.182](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.182), or [11.1825](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.1825) that terminated during the year because of the sale by the organization of a housing unit located on the land if:
    
    (1)  the housing unit is sold to a family meeting the income-eligibility standards established by Section [373B.006](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=373B.006), Local Government Code;
    
    (2)  the organization retains title to the land on which the housing unit is located; and
    
    (3)  before the date on which the housing unit is sold, the organization is designated a community land trust by the governing body of a municipality or county as provided by Section [373B.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=373B.002), Local Government Code.

    (1)  subtracting:
    
    (A)  the amount of the taxes that otherwise would be imposed on the property for the entire year had the individual qualified for the exemptions for the entire year; from
    
    (B)  the amount of the taxes that otherwise would be imposed on the property for the entire year had the individual not qualified for the exemptions during the year;
    
    (2)  multiplying the remainder determined under Subdivision (1) by a fraction, the denominator of which is 365 and the numerator of which is the number of days in that year that elapsed before the date the individual first qualified the property for the exemptions; and

    (1)  subtracting:
    
    (A)  the amount of the taxes that otherwise would be imposed on the property for the entire year had the individual qualified for the exemptions for the entire year; from
    
    (B)  the amount of the taxes that otherwise would be imposed on the property for the entire year had the individual not qualified for the exemptions during the year;
    
    (2)  multiplying the remainder determined under Subdivision (1) by a fraction, the denominator of which is 365 and the numerator of which is the sum of:

    (B)  the number of days in that year that elapsed after the date the exemptions terminated; and
    
    (3)  adding the product determined under Subdivision (2) and the amount described by Subdivision (1)(A).
    
    (c)  If an individual qualifies to receive an exemption as described by Subsection (a) with respect to a property after the amount of tax due on the property is calculated and if the effect of the qualification is to reduce the amount of tax due on the property, the assessor for each taxing unit shall recalculate the amount of the tax due on the property and correct the tax roll.  If the tax bill has been mailed and the tax on the property has not been paid, the assessor shall mail a corrected tax bill to the individual in whose name the property is listed on the tax roll or to the individual's authorized agent.  If the tax on the property has been paid, the collector for the taxing unit shall refund to the individual who paid the tax the amount by which the payment exceeded the tax due.

    (g)  A taxing unit that determines a taxpayer is delinquent in ad valorem tax payments on property other than the property for which liability for a refund arises or for a tax year other than the tax year for which liability for a refund arises may apply the amount of an overpayment to the payment of the delinquent taxes if the taxpayer was the sole owner of the property:
    
    (1)  for which the refund is sought on January 1 of the tax year in which the taxes that were overpaid were assessed; and
