    CHAPTER 313. TEXAS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ACT
    
      
    
    
    SUBCHAPTER A. GENERAL PROVISIONS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 313.001.  SHORT TITLE.  This chapter may be cited as the Texas Economic Development Act.
    
    
    
    
    Added by Acts 2001, 77th Leg., ch. 1505, Sec. 1, eff. Jan. 1, 2002.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 313.002.  FINDINGS.  The legislature finds that:
    
    (1)  many states have enacted aggressive economic development laws designed to attract large employers, create jobs, and strengthen their economies;
    
    (2)  given Texas' relatively high ad valorem taxes, it is difficult for the state to compete for new capital projects without temporarily limiting ad valorem taxes imposed on new capital investments;
    
    (3)  a significant portion of the Texas economy continues to be based in manufacturing and other capital-intensive industries, and their continued growth and overall health serve the Texas economy well;
    
    (4)  without a vibrant, strong manufacturing sector, other sectors of the economy, especially the state's service sector, will also suffer adverse consequences; and
    
    (5)  the current ad valorem tax system of this state does not favor capital-intensive businesses such as manufacturers.

    Sec. 313.003.  PURPOSES.  The purposes of this chapter are to:
    
    (1)  encourage large-scale capital investments in this state;
    
    (2)  create new, high-paying jobs in this state;
    
    (3)  attract to this state large-scale businesses that are exploring opportunities to locate in other states or other countries;
    
    (4)  enable state and local government officials and economic development professionals to compete with other states by authorizing economic development incentives that are comparable to incentives being offered to prospective employers by other states and to provide state and local officials with an effective means to attract large-scale investment;
    
    (5)  strengthen and improve the overall performance of the economy of this state;
    
    (6)  expand and enlarge the ad valorem tax base of this state; and
    
    (7)  enhance this state's economic development efforts by providing state and local officials with an effective economic development tool.
