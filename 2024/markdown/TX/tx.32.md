    CHAPTER 32. TAX LIENS AND PERSONAL LIABILITY
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 32.01.  TAX LIEN.  (a)  On January 1 of each year, a tax lien attaches to property to secure the payment of all taxes, penalties, and interest ultimately imposed for the year on the property, whether or not the taxes are imposed in the year the lien attaches.  The lien exists in favor of each taxing unit having power to tax the property.
    
    (b)  A tax lien on inventory, furniture, equipment, or other personal property is a lien in solido and attaches to all inventory, furniture, equipment, and other personal property that the property owner owns on January 1 of the year the lien attaches or that the property owner subsequently acquires.
    
    (c)  If an owner's real property is described with certainty by metes and bounds in one or more instruments of conveyance and part of that property is the owner's residence homestead taxed separately and apart from the remainder of the property, each of the liens under this section that secures the taxes imposed on that homestead and on the remainder of that property extends in solido to all the real property described in the instrument or instruments of conveyance, unless the homestead is identified as a separate parcel and is separately described in the conveyance or another instrument recorded in the real property records.
    
    (d)  The lien under this section is perfected on attachment and, except as provided by Section [32.03](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=32.03)(b), perfection requires no further action by the taxing unit.

    Sec. 32.02.  RESTRICTIONS ON A MINERAL INTEREST TAX LIEN.  (a)  If a mineral estate is severed from a surface estate and if different persons own the mineral estate and surface estate, the lien resulting from taxes imposed against each interest in the mineral estate exists only for the duration of the interest it encumbers.  After an interest in the mineral estate terminates, the lien encumbering it expires and is not enforceable:
    
    (1)  against any part of the surface estate not owned by the owner of the interest encumbered by the lien;
    
    (2)  against any part of the mineral estate not owned by the owner of the interest encumbered by the lien;  or
    
    (3)  against the owner of the surface estate as a personal obligation, unless he also owns the interest encumbered by the lien.
    
    (b)  Taxes imposed on a severed interest in a mineral estate that has terminated remain the personal liability of the person who owned the interest on January 1 of the year for which the tax was imposed.

    Sec. 32.03.  RESTRICTIONS ON PERSONAL PROPERTY TAX LIEN.  (a)  Except as provided by Subsection (a-1), a tax lien may not be enforced against personal property transferred to a buyer in ordinary course of business as defined by Section [1.201](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=1.201)(9) of the Business & Commerce Code for value who does not have actual notice of the existence of the lien.
    
    (a-1)  With regard to a manufactured home, a tax lien may be recorded at any time not later than six months after the end of the year for which the tax was owed.  A tax lien on a manufactured home may be enforced if it has been recorded in accordance with the laws in effect at the time of the recordation of the lien.  A properly recorded tax lien may not be enforced against a new manufactured home that is owned by a person who acquired the manufactured home from a retailer as a buyer in the ordinary course of business.
    
    (a-2)  A person may not transfer ownership of a manufactured home until all tax liens perfected on the home that have been timely filed with the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs have been extinguished or satisfied and released and any personal property taxes on the manufactured home which accrued on each January 1 that falls within the 18 months preceding the date of the sale have been paid.  This subsection does not apply to the sale of a manufactured home in inventory.
    
    (b)  A bona fide purchaser for value or the holder of a lien recorded on a manufactured home statement of ownership is not required to pay any taxes that have not been recorded with the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs.  In this section, manufactured home has the meaning assigned by Section [32.015](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=32.015)(b).  Unless a tax lien has been filed timely with the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs, no taxing unit, nor anyone acting on its behalf, may use a tax warrant or any other method to attempt to execute or foreclose on the manufactured home.
    
    (c)  A taxpayer may designate in writing which tax year will be credited with a particular payment.  If a taxpayer pays all the amounts owing for a given year, the taxing unit shall issue a receipt for the payment of the taxes for the designated year.
    
    (d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if a manufactured home was omitted from the tax roll for either or both of the two preceding tax years, the taxing unit may file a tax lien within the 150-day period following the date on which the tax becomes delinquent.
    
    (e)  If personal property taxes on a manufactured home have not been levied by the taxing unit, the taxing unit shall provide, upon request, an estimated amount of taxes computed by multiplying the taxable value of the manufactured home, according to the most recent certified appraisal roll for the taxing unit, by the taxing unit's adopted tax rate for the preceding tax year.  In order to enable the transfer of the manufactured home, the tax collector shall accept the payment of the estimated personal property taxes and issue a certification to the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs that the estimated taxes are being held in escrow until the taxes are levied.  Once the taxes are levied, the tax collector shall apply the escrowed sums to the levied taxes.  At the time the tax collector accepts the payment of the taxes, the tax collector shall provide notice that the payment of the estimated taxes is an estimate that may be raised once the appraisal rolls for the year are certified and that the new owner may be liable for the payment of any difference between the tax established by the certified appraisal roll and the estimate actually paid.

    Sec. 32.04.  PRIORITIES AMONG TAX LIENS.  (a)  Whether or not a tax lien provided by this chapter takes priority over a tax lien of the United States is determined by federal law.  In the absence of federal law, a tax lien provided by this chapter takes priority over a tax lien of the United States.
    
    (b)  Tax liens provided by this chapter have equal priority.

    Sec. 32.05.  PRIORITY OF TAX LIENS OVER OTHER PROPERTY INTERESTS.  (a)  A tax lien on real property takes priority over a homestead interest in the property.
    
    (b)  Except as provided by Subsection (c)(1), a tax lien provided by this chapter takes priority over:
    
    (1)  the claim of any creditor of a person whose property is encumbered by the lien;
    
    (2)  the claim of any holder of a lien on property encumbered by the tax lien, including any lien held by a property owners' association, homeowners' association, condominium unit owners' association, or council of owners of a condominium regime under a restrictive covenant, condominium declaration, master deed, or other similar instrument that secures regular or special maintenance assessments, fees, dues, interest, fines, costs, attorney's fees, or other monetary charges against the property; and
    
    (3)  any right of remainder, right or possibility of reverter, or other future interest in, or encumbrance against, the property, whether vested or contingent.
    
    (b-1)  The priority given to a tax lien by Subsection (b) prevails, regardless of whether the debt, lien, future interest, or other encumbrance existed before attachment of the tax lien.
    
    (c)  A tax lien provided by this chapter is inferior to:
    
    (1)  a claim for any survivor's allowance, funeral expenses, or expenses of the last illness of a decedent made against the estate of a decedent as provided by law;
    
    (2)  except as provided by Subsection (b)(2), a recorded restrictive covenant that runs with the land  and was recorded before January 1 of the year the tax lien arose; or
    
    (3)  a valid easement of record recorded before January 1 of the year the tax lien arose.
    
    (d)  In an action brought under Chapter [33](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=33) for the enforced collection of a delinquent tax against property, a property owners' association, homeowners' association, condominium unit owners' association, or council of owners of a condominium regime that holds a lien for regular or special maintenance assessments, fees, dues, interest, fines, costs, attorney's fees, or other monetary charges against the property is not a necessary party to the action unless, at the time the action is commenced, notice of the lien in a liquidated amount is evidenced by a sworn instrument duly executed by an authorized person and recorded with the clerk of the county in which the property is located.   A tax sale of the property extinguishes the lien held by a property owners' association, homeowners' association, condominium unit owners' association, or council of owners of a condominium regime for all amounts that accrued before the date of sale if:
    
    (1)  the holder of the lien is joined as a party to an action brought under Chapter [33](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=33) by virtue of a notice of the lien on record at the time the action is commenced; or
    
    (2)  the notice of lien is not of record at the time the action is commenced, regardless of whether the holder of the lien is made a party to the action.
    
    (e)  The existence of a recorded restrictive covenant, declaration, or master deed that generally provides for the lien held by a property owners' association, homeowners' association, condominium unit owners' association, or council of owners of a condominium regime does not, by itself, constitute actual or constructive notice to a taxing unit of a lien under Subsection (d).

Section 1026.23) applies to a transfer under this section of a tax lien on residential property owned and used by the property owner for personal, family, or household purposes.
    
    (e)  A transferee holding a tax lien transferred as provided by this section may not charge a greater rate of interest than 18 percent a year on the funds advanced.  Funds advanced are limited to the taxes, penalties, interest, and collection costs paid as shown on the tax receipt, expenses paid to record the lien, plus reasonable closing costs.
    
    (e-1)  A transferee of a tax lien may not charge a fee for any expenses arising after the closing of a loan secured by a tax lien transferred under this section, including collection costs, except for:
    
    (1)  interest expressly authorized under this section;
    
    (2)  the fees for filing the release of the tax lien under Subsection (b);
    
    (3)  the fee for providing a payoff statement under Subsection (f-3);
    
    (4)  the fee for providing information regarding the current balance owed by the property owner under Subsection (g); and
    
    (5)  the fees expressly authorized under Section [351.0021](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=351.0021), Finance Code.
    
    (e-2)  The contract between the property owner and the transferee may provide for interest for default, in addition to the interest permitted under Subsection (e), if any part of the installment remains unpaid after the 10th day after the date the installment is due, including Sundays and holidays.  If the lien transferred is on residential property owned and used by the property owner for personal, family, or household purposes, the additional interest may not exceed five cents for each $1 of a scheduled installment.
    
    (f)  The holder of a loan secured by a transferred tax lien that is delinquent for 90 consecutive days must send a notice of the delinquency by certified mail on or before the 120th day of delinquency or, if the 120th day is not a business day, on the next business day after the 120th day of delinquency, to any holder of a recorded preexisting lien on the property.  The holder or mortgage servicer of a recorded preexisting lien on property encumbered by a tax lien transferred as provided by Subsection (b) is entitled, within six months after the date on which the notice is sent, to obtain a release of the transferred tax lien by paying the transferee of the tax lien the amount owed under the contract between the property owner and the transferee.
    
    (f-1)  If an obligation secured by a preexisting first lien on the property is delinquent for at least 90 consecutive days and the obligation has been referred to a collection specialist, the mortgage servicer or the holder of the first lien may send a notice of the delinquency to the transferee of a tax lien.  The mortgage servicer or the first lienholder is entitled, within six months after the date on which that notice is sent, to obtain a release of the transferred tax lien by paying the transferee of the tax lien the amount owed under the contract between the property owner and the transferee.  The Finance Commission of Texas by rule shall prescribe the form and content of the notice under this subsection.
    
    (f-2)  The rights granted by Subsections (f) and (f-1) do not affect a right of redemption in a foreclosure proceeding described by Subsection (k) or (k-1).
    
    (f-3)  Notwithstanding any contractual agreement with the property owner, the transferee of a tax lien must provide the payoff information required by this section to the greatest extent permitted by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (15 U.S.C. Section 6802) and Regulation P (12 C.F.R. Part 1016).  The payoff statement must meet the requirements of a payoff statement defined by Section [12.017](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=12.017), Property Code.  A transferee may charge a reasonable fee for a payoff statement that is requested after an initial payoff statement is provided.  However, a transferee is not required to release payoff information pursuant to a notice under Subsection (f-1) unless the notice contains the information prescribed by the Finance Commission of Texas.
    
    (f-4)  Failure to comply with Subsection (b-1), (f), or (f-1) does not invalidate a tax lien transferred under this section or a deed of trust.
    
    (g)  At any time after the end of the six-month period specified by Subsection (f) and before a notice of foreclosure of the transferred tax lien is sent, the transferee of the tax lien may require the property owner to provide written authorization and pay a reasonable fee before providing information regarding the current balance owed by the property owner to the transferee.
    
    (h)  A mortgage servicer who pays a property tax loan secured by a tax lien transferred under this section becomes subrogated to all rights in the lien.
    
    (i)  A judicial foreclosure of a tax lien transferred under this section may not be instituted within one year from the date on which the lien is recorded in all counties in which the property is located, unless the contract between the owner of the property and the transferee provides otherwise.
    
    (j)  After one year from the date on which a tax lien transferred under this section is recorded in all counties in which the property is located, the transferee of the lien may foreclose the lien in the manner provided by Subsection (c) unless the contract between the transferee and the owner of the property encumbered by the lien provides otherwise.  The proceeds of a sale following a judicial foreclosure as provided by this subsection shall be applied first to the payment of court costs, then to payment of the judgment, including accrued interest, and then to the payment of any attorney's fees fixed in the judgment.  Any remaining proceeds shall be paid to other holders of liens on the property in the order of their priority and then to the person whose property was sold at the tax sale.
    
    (k)  Beginning on the date the foreclosure deed is recorded, the person whose property is sold as provided by Subsection (c) or the mortgage servicer of a prior recorded lien against the property is entitled to redeem the foreclosed property from the purchaser or the purchaser's successor by paying the purchaser or successor:
    
    (1)  125 percent of the purchase price during the first year of the redemption period or 150 percent of the purchase price during the second year of the redemption period with cash or cash equivalent funds; and
    
    (2)  the amount reasonably spent by the purchaser in connection with the property as costs within the meaning of Section [34.21](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=34.21)(g) and the legal judgment rate of return on that amount.
    
    (k-1)  The right of redemption provided by Subsection (k) may be exercised on or before the second anniversary of the date on which the purchaser's deed is filed of record if the property sold was the residence homestead of the owner, was land designated for agricultural use, or was a mineral interest.  For any other property, the right of redemption must be exercised not later than the 180th day after the date on which the purchaser's deed is filed of record.  If a person redeems the property as provided by Subsection (k) and this subsection, the purchaser at the tax sale or the purchaser's successor shall deliver a deed without warranty to the property to the person redeeming the property.  If the person who owned the property at the time of foreclosure redeems the property, all liens existing on the property at the time of the tax sale remain in effect to the extent not paid from the sale proceeds.
    
    (l)  Except as specifically provided by this section, a property owner cannot waive or limit any requirement imposed on a transferee by this section.

A person is not relieved of the obligation because he no longer owns the property.
    
    (b)  The person in whose name a property is required to be listed by Section [25.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=25.13) of this code is personally liable for the taxes imposed on the property.

The liability imposed by this subsection is in addition to any other penalty provided by law.  The dissolution of a corporation, association, limited liability company, or partnership does not affect a responsible individual's liability under this subsection.
    
    (f)  Venue for suits arising under this section shall be governed by Section [33.41](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=33.41)(a).

    (2)  a purchaser of the property who has the duty under the installment contract to pay taxes on the property.
