This subsection applies only to property that has a historical cost when new of more than $50,000.
    
    (d)  A fiduciary who renders property shall indicate his fiduciary capacity and shall state the name and address of the owner.
    
    (d-1)  A secured party who renders property under Subsection (c-2) shall indicate the party's status as a secured party and shall state the name and address of the property owner.

    (f)  Notwithstanding Subsections (a) and (b), a rendition statement of a person who owns tangible personal property used for the production of income located in the appraisal district that, in the owner's opinion, has an aggregate value of less than $20,000 is required to contain only:

    (g)  A person's good faith estimate of the market value of the property under Subsection (a)(5) is solely for the purpose of compliance with the requirement to render tangible personal property and is inadmissible in any subsequent protest, hearing, appeal, suit, or other proceeding under this title involving the property, except for:

    (i)  Subsection (a) does not apply to a property owner whose property is subject to appraisal by a third party retained by the appraisal district if the property owner provides information substantially equivalent to that required by Subsection (a) regarding the property directly to the third party appraiser.
    
    (j)  Subsection (a) does not apply to property that is exempt from taxation.
    
    (k)  Notwithstanding Subsections (a) and (b), an individual who has been granted or has applied for an exemption from taxation under Section [11.254](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.254) for a motor vehicle the individual owns is not required to render the motor vehicle for taxation.
    
    (l)  If the information contained in the most recent rendition statement filed by a person in a prior tax year is accurate with respect to the current tax year, the person may comply with the requirements of Subsection (a) by filing a rendition statement on a form prescribed or approved by the comptroller under Section [22.24](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=22.24)(c) on which the person has checked the appropriate box to affirm that the information continues to be complete and accurate.

    (3)  a court imposes the penalty under Section [22.29](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=22.29) and the order of the court imposing the penalty subsequently becomes final.

    (1)  the person filed a false statement or report with the intent to commit fraud or to evade the tax;  or
    
    (2)  the person alters, destroys, or conceals any record, document, or thing, or presents to the chief appraiser any altered or fraudulent record, document, or thing, or otherwise engages in fraudulent conduct, for the purpose of affecting the course or outcome of an inspection, investigation, determination, or other proceeding before the appraisal district.
    
    (b)  Enforcement of this section shall be by a proceeding initiated by the district or county attorney of the county in which the appraisal is established, on behalf of the appraisal district.

    (4)  the completeness of the person's records;
    
    (5)  the person's reliance on advice provided by the appraisal district that may have contributed to the person's failure to comply and the imposition of the penalty;
    
    (6)  any change in appraisal district policy during the current or preceding tax year that may affect how property is rendered; and
    
    (7)  any other factors that may have caused the person to fail to timely file a statement or report.
    
    (c)  The procedures for a protest before the appraisal review board under this section are governed by the procedures for a taxpayer protest under Subchapter [C](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41.41), Chapter [41](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41).
