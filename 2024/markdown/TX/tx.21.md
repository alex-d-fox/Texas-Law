    (1)  it is located in the unit on January 1 for more than a temporary period;
    
    (2)  it normally is located in the unit, even though it is outside the unit on January 1, if it is outside the unit only temporarily;
    
    (3)  it normally is returned to the unit between uses elsewhere and is not located in any one place for more than a temporary period;  or
    
    (4)  the owner resides (for property not used for business purposes) or maintains the owner's principal place of business in this state (for property used for business purposes) in the unit and the property is taxable in this state but does not have a taxable situs pursuant to Subdivisions (1) through (3) of this subsection.
    
    (b)  Tangible personal property having taxable situs at the same location as real property detached from a school district and annexed by another school district under Chapter [49](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=49), Education Code, is taxable in the tax year in which the detachment and annexation occurs by the same school district by which the real property is taxable in that tax year under Chapter [49](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=49), Education Code.  For purposes of this subsection and Chapter [49](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=49), Education Code, tangible personal property has taxable situs at the same location as real property detached and annexed under Chapter [49](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=49), Education Code, if the detachment and annexation of the real property, had it occurred before January 1 of the tax year, would have changed the taxable situs of the tangible personal property determined as provided by Subsection (a) from the school district from which the real property was detached to the school district to which the real property was annexed.
    
    (c)  Tangible personal property has taxable situs in a school district that is the result of a consolidation under Chapter [49](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=49), Education Code, in the year in which the consolidation occurs if the property would have had taxable situs in the consolidated district in that year had the consolidation occurred before January 1 of that year.
    
    (d)  A motor vehicle does not have taxable situs in a taxing unit under Subsection (a)(1) if, on January 1, the vehicle:

    (2)  is offered for resale.
    
    (e)  In this subsection, "portable drilling rig" includes equipment associated with the drilling rig.  A portable drilling rig designed for land-based oil or gas drilling or exploration operations is taxable by each taxing unit in which the rig is located on January 1 if the rig was located in the appraisal district that appraises property for the unit for the preceding 365 consecutive days.  If the drilling rig was not located in the appraisal district where it is located on January 1 for the preceding 365 days, it is taxable by each taxing unit in which the owner's principal place of business in this state is located on January 1, unless the owner renders the rig under Chapter [22](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=22) to the appraisal district in which the rig is located on January 1, in which event the rig is taxable by each taxing unit in which the rig is located on January 1.  If an owner elects to render any portable drilling rig to the appraisal district in which the rig is located on January 1 when the rig otherwise would be taxable at the owner's principal place of business in this state, all the owner's portable drilling rigs are taxable by the taxing units in which each rig is located on January 1.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, if the owner of a portable drilling rig does not have a place of business in this state, the rig is taxable by each taxing unit in which the rig is located on January 1.

(a)  If a vessel or other watercraft that is taxable by a taxing unit is used continually outside this state, whether regularly or irregularly, the appraisal office shall allocate to this state the portion of the total market value of the vessel or watercraft that fairly reflects its use in this state.

    (b)  The appraisal office shall make the allocation as provided by Subsections (b-1), (b-2), and (b-3).
    
    (b-1)  Except as provided by Subsection (b-2), the allocable portion of the total fair market value of a vessel or other watercraft used as an instrumentality of commerce that is taxable in this state is determined by multiplying the total fair market value by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of miles the vessel or watercraft was operated in this state during the year preceding the tax year and the denominator of which is the total number of miles the vessel or watercraft was operated during the year preceding the tax year.
    
    (b-2)  A property owner that operates a fleet of vessels or other watercraft that are used as instrumentalities of commerce may elect in writing submitted to the appraisal office to have the appraisal office make the allocation under this subsection.  If the property owner makes the election, the allocable portion of the total fair market value of a vessel or other watercraft that is part of the property owner's fleet, is used as an instrumentality of commerce, is taxable in this state, and has taxable situs at a location in the appraisal district is determined by multiplying the total fair market value of the vessel or other watercraft by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of miles that all the vessels or other watercraft of the property owner's fleet that are used as instrumentalities of commerce, are taxable in this state, and have taxable situs at a location in the same appraisal district as the vessel or other watercraft the value of which is allocated under this subsection were operated in this state during the year preceding the tax year and the denominator of which is the total number of miles that all the vessels or other watercraft of the property owner's fleet that are used as instrumentalities of commerce, are taxable in this state, and have taxable situs at a location in the same appraisal district as the vessel or other watercraft the value of which is allocated under this subsection were operated during the year preceding the tax year.  Notwithstanding Sections [21.02](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=21.02) and [21.021](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=21.021), a property owner that elects to have the appraisal office make the allocation of the property owner's fleet under this subsection may designate the location of the property owner's principal place of business as the taxable situs of the fleet.
    
    (b-3)  The allocable portion of the total fair market value of a special-purpose vessel or other watercraft not used as an instrumentality of commerce is determined by multiplying the total fair market value by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days the vessel or watercraft was physically located in this state during the year preceding the tax year and the denominator of which is 365.
    
    (c)  A vessel or other watercraft used as an instrumentality of commerce or a special-purpose vessel or other watercraft not used as an instrumentality of commerce that is used outside this state and is in this state solely to be converted, repaired, stored, or inspected is presumed to be in interstate, international, or foreign commerce and not located in this state for longer than a temporary period for purposes of Sections [11.01](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.01) and [21.02](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=21.02).
    
    (d)  If the allocation provisions of this section do not fairly reflect the use of a vessel or other watercraft in this state, an alternate allocation formula shall be utilized if the property owner or appraisal office demonstrates that:
    
    (1)  the allocation formula specified in this section is arbitrary and unreasonable as applied to the vessel or watercraft;  and
    
    (2)  the formula or indication of use proposed by the property owner or appraisal office more fairly reflects the vessel or watercraft's use in this state than that specified in this section.
    
    (e)  To receive an allocation of value under this section, a property owner must apply for the allocation on a form that substantially complies with the form prescribed by the comptroller.  The application must be filed with the chief appraiser for the district in which the property to which the application applies is taxable before the approval of the appraisal records by the appraisal review board as provided by Section [41.12](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=41.12) of this code.
    
    (f)  The comptroller shall promulgate forms and may adopt rules consistent with the provisions of this section.
    
    (g)  A vessel or other watercraft to be used as an instrumentality of commerce or a special-purpose vessel or other watercraft not to be used as an instrumentality of commerce that is under construction in this state is presumed to be in interstate, international, or foreign commerce and not located in this state for longer than a temporary period for purposes of Sections [11.01](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.01) and [21.02](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=21.02).
