    SUBCHAPTER A. GENERAL PROVISIONS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 33.01.  PENALTIES AND INTEREST.  (a)  A delinquent tax incurs a penalty of six percent of the amount of the tax for the first calendar month it is delinquent plus one percent for each additional month or portion of a month the tax remains unpaid prior to July 1 of the year in which it becomes delinquent.  However, a tax delinquent on July 1 incurs a total penalty of twelve percent of the amount of the delinquent tax without regard to the number of months the tax has been delinquent.  A delinquent tax continues to incur the penalty provided by this subsection as long as the tax remains unpaid, regardless of whether a judgment for the delinquent tax has been rendered.
    
    (b)  If a person who exercises the split-payment option provided by Section [31.03](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=31.03) of this code fails to make the second payment before July 1, the second payment is delinquent and incurs a penalty of twelve percent of the amount of unpaid tax.
    
    (c)  A delinquent tax accrues interest at a rate of one percent for each month or portion of a month the tax remains unpaid.  Interest payable under this section is to compensate the taxing unit for revenue lost because of the delinquency.  A delinquent tax continues to accrue interest under this subsection as long as the tax remains unpaid, regardless of whether a judgment for the delinquent tax has been rendered.
    
    (d)  In lieu of the penalty imposed under Subsection (a), a delinquent tax incurs a penalty of 50 percent of the amount of the tax without regard to the number of months the tax has been delinquent if the tax is delinquent because the property owner received an exemption under:
    
    (1)  Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13) and the chief appraiser subsequently cancels the exemption because the residence was not the principal residence of the property owner and the property owner received an exemption for two or more additional residence homesteads for the tax year in which the tax was imposed;
    
    (2)  Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13)(c) or (d) for a person who is 65 years of age or older and the chief appraiser subsequently cancels the exemption because the property owner was younger than 65 years of age;  or
    
    (3)  Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13)(q) and the chief appraiser subsequently cancels the exemption because the property owner was younger than 55 years of age when the property owner's spouse died.
    
    (e)  A penalty imposed under Subsection (d) does not apply if:
    
    (1)  the exemption was granted by the appraisal district or board and not at the request or application of the property owner or the property owner's agent;  or
    
    (2)  at any time before the date the tax becomes delinquent, the property owner gives to the chief appraiser of the appraisal district in which the property is located written notice of circumstances that would disqualify the owner for the exemption.
    
    (f)  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, a delinquent tax for which a person defers payment under Section [31.02](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=31.02)(b) that is not paid on or before the date the deferral period prescribed by that subsection expires:
    
    (1)  accrues interest at a rate of six percent for each year or portion of a year the tax remains unpaid; and
    
    (2)  does not incur a penalty.

    (1)  shall waive penalties and may provide for the waiver of interest on a delinquent tax if an act or omission of an officer, employee, or agent of the taxing unit or the appraisal district in which the taxing unit participates caused or resulted in the taxpayer's failure to pay the tax before delinquency and if the tax is paid not later than the 21st day after the date the taxpayer knows or should know of the delinquency;
    
    (2)  may waive penalties and provide for the waiver of interest on a delinquent tax if:

    (2)  the tax bill was returned because of an act or omission of an officer, employee, or agent of the taxing unit or the appraisal district in which the taxing unit participates and the taxing unit or appraisal district did not send another tax bill on the property in question at least 21 days before the delinquency date to the proper mailing address.
    
    (c)  For the purposes of this section, a property owner is considered to have furnished a current mailing address to the taxing unit or to the appraisal district if the current address is expressly communicated to the appraisal district in writing or if the appraisal district received a copy of a recorded instrument transferring ownership of real property and the current mailing address of the new owner is included in the instrument or in accompanying communications or letters of transmittal.

A request for a waiver of penalties and interest under Subsection (a)(2) must be made before the first anniversary of the date the religious organization acquires the property.  A request for a waiver of penalties and interest under Subsection (i) must be made before the 181st day after the date the property owner making the request receives notice of the delinquent tax that satisfies the requirements of Section [33.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=33.04)(c).  To be valid, a waiver of penalties or interest under this section must be requested in writing.

    (1)  must be in writing;
    
    (2)  must provide for payments to be made in monthly installments;

    Sec. 33.06.  DEFERRED COLLECTION OF TAXES ON RESIDENCE HOMESTEAD OF ELDERLY OR DISABLED PERSON OR DISABLED VETERAN.  (a)  An individual is entitled to defer collection of a tax, abate a suit to collect a delinquent tax, or abate a sale to foreclose a tax lien if:
    
    (1)  the individual:
    
    (A)  is 65 years of age or older;
    
    (B)  is disabled as defined by Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13)(m); or
    
    (C)  is qualified to receive an exemption under Section [11.22](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.22); and
    
    (2)  the tax was imposed against property that the individual owns and occupies as a residence homestead.
    
    (b)  To obtain a deferral, an individual must file with the chief appraiser for the appraisal district in which the property is located an affidavit stating the facts required to be established by Subsection (a). The chief appraiser shall notify each taxing unit participating in the district of the filing. After an affidavit is filed under this subsection, a taxing unit may not file suit to collect delinquent taxes on the property and the property may not be sold at a sale to foreclose the tax lien until the 181st day after the date the collector for the taxing unit delivers a notice of delinquency of the taxes following the date the individual no longer owns and occupies the property as a residence homestead.
    
    (c)  To obtain an abatement of a pending suit, the individual must file in the court in which suit is pending an affidavit stating the facts required to be established by Subsection (a). If no controverting affidavit is filed by the taxing unit filing suit or if, after a hearing, the court finds the individual is entitled to the deferral, the court shall abate the suit until the 181st day after the date the collector for the taxing unit delivers a notice of delinquency of the taxes following the date the individual no longer owns and occupies the property as a residence homestead. The clerk of the court shall deliver a copy of the judgment abating the suit to the chief appraiser of each appraisal district that appraises the property.
    
    (c-1)  To obtain an abatement of a pending sale to foreclose the tax lien, the individual must deliver an affidavit stating the facts required to be established by Subsection (a) to the chief appraiser of each appraisal district that appraises the property, the collector for the taxing unit that requested the order of sale or the attorney representing that taxing unit for the collection of delinquent taxes, and the officer charged with selling the property not later than the fifth day before the date of the sale. After an affidavit is delivered under this subsection, the property may not be sold at a tax sale until the 181st day after the date the collector for the taxing unit delivers a notice of delinquency of the taxes following the date the individual no longer owns and occupies the property as a residence homestead. If property is sold in violation of this section, the property owner may file a motion to set aside the sale under the same cause number and in the same court as a judgment reference in the order of sale. The motion must be filed during the applicable redemption period as set forth in Section [34.21](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=34.21)(a) or, if the property is bid off to a taxing entity, on or before the 180th day following the date the taxing unit's deed is filed of record, whichever is later. This right is not transferable to a third party.
    
    (d)  A tax lien remains on the property and interest continues to accrue during the period collection of taxes is deferred or abated under this section.  The annual interest rate during the deferral or abatement period is five percent instead of the rate provided by Section [33.01](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=33.01).  Interest and penalties that accrued or that were incurred or imposed under Section [33.01](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=33.01) or [33.07](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=33.07) before the date the individual files the deferral affidavit under Subsection (b) or the date the judgment abating the suit is entered, as applicable, are preserved.  A penalty under Section [33.01](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=33.01) is not incurred during a deferral or abatement period.  The additional penalty under Section [33.07](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=33.07) may be imposed and collected only if the taxes for which collection is deferred or abated remain delinquent on or after the 181st day after the date the deferral or abatement period expires.  A plea of limitation, laches, or want of prosecution does not apply against the taxing unit because of deferral or abatement of collection as provided by this section.
    
    (e)  Each year the chief appraiser for each appraisal district shall publicize in a manner reasonably designed to notify all residents of the district or county of the provisions of this section and, specifically, the method by which eligible persons may obtain a deferral or abatement.
    
    (f)  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, if an individual who qualifies for a deferral or abatement of collection of taxes on property as provided by this section dies, the deferral or abatement continues in effect until the 181st day after the date the collector for the taxing unit delivers a notice of delinquency of the taxes following the date the surviving spouse of the individual no longer owns and occupies the property as a residence homestead if:
    
    (1)  the property was the residence homestead of the deceased spouse when the deceased spouse died;
    
    (2)  the surviving spouse was 55 years of age or older when the deceased spouse died; and
    
    (3)  the property was the residence homestead of the surviving spouse when the deceased spouse died.
    
    (g)  If the ownership interest of an individual entitled to a deferral under this section is a life estate, a lien for the deferred tax attaches to the estate of the life tenant, and not to the remainder interest, if the owner of the remainder is an institution of higher education that has not consented to the deferral.  In this subsection, "institution of higher education" has the meaning assigned by Section [61.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=61.003), Education Code.  This subsection does not apply to a deferral for which the individual entitled to the deferral filed the affidavit required by Subsection (b) before September 1, 2011.
    
    (h)  An heir property owner who qualifies heir property as the owner's residence homestead under Chapter [11](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11) is considered the sole owner of the property for the purposes of this section.

    Sec. 33.065.  DEFERRED COLLECTION OF TAXES ON APPRECIATING RESIDENCE HOMESTEAD.  (a)  An individual is entitled to defer or abate a suit to collect a delinquent tax imposed on the portion of the appraised value of property the individual owns and occupies as the individual's residence homestead that exceeds the sum of:
    
    (1)  105 percent of the appraised value of the property for the preceding year;  and
    
    (2)  the market value of all new improvements to the property.
    
    (b)  An individual may not obtain a deferral or abatement under this section, and any deferral or abatement previously received expires, if the taxes on the portion of the appraised value of the property that does not exceed the amount provided by Subsection (a) are delinquent.
    
    (c)  To obtain a deferral, an individual must file with the chief appraiser for the appraisal district in which the property is located an affidavit stating the facts required to be established by Subsection (a).  The chief appraiser shall notify each taxing unit participating in the district of the filing.  After an affidavit is filed under this subsection, a taxing unit may not file suit to collect delinquent taxes on the property for which collection is deferred until the individual no longer owns and occupies the property as a residence homestead.
    
    (d)  To obtain an abatement, the individual must file in the court in which the delinquent tax suit is pending an affidavit stating the facts required to be established by Subsection (a).  If the taxing unit that filed the suit does not file a controverting affidavit or if, after a hearing, the court finds the individual is entitled to the deferral, the court shall abate the suit until the individual no longer owns and occupies the property as the individual's residence homestead.  The clerk of the court shall deliver a copy of the judgment abating the suit to the chief appraiser of each appraisal district that appraises the property.
    
    (e)  A deferral or abatement under this section applies only to ad valorem taxes imposed beginning with the tax year following the first tax year the individual entitled to the deferral or abatement qualifies the property for an exemption under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13).  For purposes of this subsection, the owner of a residence homestead that is qualified for an exemption under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13) on January 1, 1998, is considered to have qualified the property for the first time in the 1997 tax year.
    
    (f)  If the collection of delinquent taxes on the property was deferred in a prior tax year and the sum of the amounts described by Subsections (a)(1) and (2) exceeds the appraised value of the property for the current tax year, the amount of taxes the collection of which may be deferred is reduced by the amount calculated by multiplying the taxing unit's tax rate for the current year by the amount by which that sum exceeds the appraised value of the property.
    
    (g)  A tax lien remains on the property and interest continues to accrue during the period collection of delinquent taxes is deferred or abated under this section.  The annual interest rate during the deferral or abatement period is eight percent instead of the rate provided by Section [33.01](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=33.01).  Interest and penalties that accrued or that were incurred or imposed under Section [33.01](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=33.01) or [33.07](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=33.07) before the date the individual files the deferral affidavit under Subsection (c) or the date the judgment abating the suit is entered, as applicable, are preserved.  A penalty is not incurred on the delinquent taxes for which collection is deferred or abated during a deferral or abatement period.  The additional penalty under Section [33.07](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=33.07) may be imposed and collected only if the delinquent taxes for which collection is deferred or abated remain delinquent on or after the 91st day after the date the deferral or abatement period expires.  A plea of limitation, laches, or want of prosecution does not apply against the taxing unit because of deferral or abatement of collection as provided by this section.
    
    (h)  Each year the chief appraiser for each appraisal district shall publicize in a manner reasonably designed to notify all residents of the county for which the appraisal district is established of the provisions of this section and, specifically, the method by which an eligible person may obtain a deferral.
    
    (i)  In this section:
    
    (1)  "New improvement" means an improvement to a residence homestead that is made after the appraisal of the property for the preceding year and that increases the market value of the property.  The term does not include ordinary maintenance of an existing structure or the grounds or another feature of the property.
    
    (2)  "Residence homestead" has the meaning assigned that term by Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13).
    
    (j)  An heir property owner who qualifies heir property as the owner's residence homestead under Chapter [11](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11) is considered the sole owner of the property for the purposes of this section.

The amount of the penalty may not exceed the amount of the compensation specified in the contract with the attorney to be paid in connection with the collection of the delinquent taxes.

If the petition contains the appropriate allegations, the prayer may be for both foreclosure of a lien on the property and personal judgment.

    (d)  Simultaneously with the filing of the petition under this section, a taxing unit shall also file a motion with the court seeking an order approving notice of the petition to each defendant by certified mail in lieu of citation and, if the amount of delinquent taxes, penalties, interest, and attorney's fees alleged to be owed exceeds the appraised value of the parcel, waiving the appointment of an attorney ad litem.  The motion must be supported by certified copies of tax records that show the tax years for which delinquent taxes are owed, the amounts of delinquent taxes, penalties, interest, and attorney's fees, and, if appropriate, the appraised value of the parcel.
    
    (e)  The court shall approve a motion under Subsection (d) if the documents in support of the motion show that:
    
    (1)  the amount of delinquent taxes, penalties, interest, and attorney's fees that are owed exceeds the appraised value of the parcel; or
    
    (2)  there are 10 or more years for which delinquent taxes are owed on the parcel.
    
    (f)  Before filing a petition under this section, or as soon afterwards as practicable, the taxing unit or its attorney shall determine the address of each owner of a property interest in the parcel for the purpose of providing notice of the pending petition.  If the title search, the taxing unit's tax records, and the appraisal district records do not disclose an address of a person with a property interest, consulting the following sources of information is to be considered a reasonable effort by the taxing unit or its attorney to determine the address of a person with a property interest in the parcel subject to foreclosure:
    
    (1)  telephone directories, electronic or otherwise, that cover:
    
    (A)  the area of any last known address for the person; and
    
    (B)  the county in which the parcel is located;
    
    (2)  voter registration records in the county in which the parcel is located; and
    
    (3)  where applicable, assumed name records maintained by the county clerk of the county in which the parcel is located and corporate records maintained by the secretary of state.
    
    (g)  Not later than the 45th day before the date on which a hearing on the merits on a taxing unit's petition is scheduled, the taxing unit or its attorney shall send a copy of the petition and a notice by certified mail to each person whose address is determined under Subsection (f), informing the person of the pending foreclosure action and the scheduled hearing.  A copy of each notice shall be filed with the clerk of the court together with an affidavit by the tax collector or by the taxing unit's attorney attesting to the fact and date of mailing of the notice.
    
    (h)  In addition to the notice required by Subsection (g), the taxing unit shall provide notice by publication and by posting to all persons with a property interest in the parcel subject to foreclosure.  The notice shall be published in the English language once a week for two weeks in a newspaper that is published in the county in which the parcel is located and that has been in general circulation for at least one year immediately before the date of the first publication, with the first publication to be not less than the 45th day before the date on which the taxing unit's petition is scheduled to be heard.  When returned and filed in the trial court, an  affidavit of the editor or publisher of the newspaper attesting to the date of publication, together with a printed copy of the notice as published, is sufficient proof of publication under this subsection.  If a newspaper is not published in the county in which the parcel is located, publication in an otherwise  qualifying newspaper published in an adjoining county is sufficient.  The maximum fee for publishing the citation shall be the lowest published word or line rate of that newspaper for classified advertising.  The notice by posting shall be in the English language and given by posting a copy of the notice at the courthouse door of the county in which the foreclosure is pending not less than the 45th day before the date on which the taxing unit's petition is scheduled to be heard.  Proof of the posting of the notice shall be made by affidavit of the attorney for the taxing unit, or of the person posting it.  If the publication of the notice cannot be had for the maximum fee established in this subsection, and that fact is supported by the affidavit of the attorney for the taxing unit, the notice by posting under this subsection is sufficient.
    
    (i)  The notice required by Subsections (g) and (h) must include:
    
    (1)  a statement that foreclosure proceedings have been commenced and the date the petition was filed;
    
    (2)  a legal description, tax account number, and, if known, a street address for the parcel in which the addressee owns a property interest;
    
    (3)  the name of the person to whom the notice is addressed and the name of each other person who, according to the title search, has an interest in the parcel in which the addressee owns a property interest;
    
    (4)  the date, time, and place of the scheduled hearing on the petition;
    
    (5)  a statement that the recipient of the notice may lose whatever property interest the recipient owns in the parcel as a result of the hearing and any subsequent tax sale;
    
    (6)  a statement explaining how a person may contest the taxing unit's petition as provided by Subsection (j) and that a person's interest in the parcel may be preserved by paying all delinquent taxes, penalties, interest, attorney's fees, and court costs before the date of the scheduled hearing on the petition;
    
    (7)  the name, address, and telephone number of the taxing unit and the taxing unit's attorney of record; and
    
    (8)  the name of each other taxing unit that imposes taxes on the parcel, together with a notice that any taxing unit may intervene without further notice and set up its claims for delinquent taxes.
    
    (j)  A person claiming a property interest in a parcel subject to foreclosure may contest a taxing unit's petition by filing with the clerk of the court a written response to the petition not later than the seventh day before the date scheduled for hearing on the petition and specifying in the response any affirmative defense of the person.  A copy of the response must be served on the taxing unit's attorney of record in the manner required by Rule 21a, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.  The taxing unit is entitled on request to a continuance of the hearing if a written response filed to a notice of the hearing contains an affirmative defense or requests affirmative relief against the taxing unit.
    
    (k)  Before entry of a judgment under this section, a taxing unit may remove a parcel erroneously included in the petition and may take a voluntary nonsuit as to one or more parcels of property without prejudicing its action against the remaining parcels.
    
    (l)  If before the hearing on a taxing unit's petition the taxing unit discovers a deficiency in the provision of notice under this section, the taxing unit shall take reasonable steps in good faith to correct the deficiency before the hearing.  A notice provided by Subsections (g)-(i) is in lieu of citation issued and served under Rule 117a, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.  Regardless of the manner in which notice under this section is given, an attorney ad litem may not be appointed for a person with an interest in a parcel with delinquent taxes, penalties, interest, and attorney's fees against the parcel in an amount that exceeds the parcel's appraised value.  To the extent of any additional conflict between this section and the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, this section controls.  Except as otherwise provided by this section, a suit brought under this section is governed generally by the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and by Subchapters C and D of this chapter.
    
    (m)  A judgment in favor of a taxing unit under this section must be only for foreclosure of the tax lien against the parcel.  The judgment may not include a personal judgment against any person.
    
    (n)  A person is considered to have been provided sufficient notice of foreclosure and opportunity to be heard for purposes of a proceeding under this section if the taxing unit follows the procedures required by this section for notice by certified mail or by publication and posting or if one or more of the following apply:
    
    (1)  the person had constructive notice of the hearing on the merits by acquiring an interest in the parcel after the date of the filing of the taxing unit's petition;
    
    (2)  the person appeared at the hearing on the taxing unit's petition or filed a responsive pleading or other communication with the clerk of the court before the date of the hearing; or
    
    (3)  before the hearing on the taxing unit's petition, the person had actual notice of the hearing.

(a)  After notice has been provided to a person, the person's real property, whether improved or unimproved, is subject to seizure by a municipality for the payment of delinquent ad valorem taxes, penalties, and interest the person owes on the property and the amount secured by a municipal health or safety lien on the property if:
    
    (1)  the property:
    
    (A)  is in a municipality;
    
    (B)  is less than one acre;  and

    (3)  the tax collector of the municipality determines that seizure of the property under this subchapter for the payment of the delinquent taxes, penalties, and interest, and of a municipal health and safety lien on the property, would be in the best interest of the municipality and the other taxing units after determining that the sum of all outstanding tax and municipal claims against the property plus the estimated costs under Section [33.48](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=33.48) of a standard judicial foreclosure exceed the anticipated proceeds from a tax sale.
    
    (b)  The seizure and sale may not be set aside or voided because of any error in determination.
    
    (c)  For purposes of this section, a property is presumed to have been abandoned for at least one year if, during that period, the property has remained vacant and a lawful act of ownership of the property has not been exercised.  The tax collector of a municipality may rely on the affidavit of any competent person with personal knowledge of the facts in determining whether a property has been abandoned or vacant.  For purposes of this subsection:
    
    (1)  property is considered vacant if there is an absence of any activity by the owner, a tenant, or a licensee related to residency, work, trade, business, leisure, or recreation;  and
    
    (2)  "lawful act of ownership" includes mowing or cutting grass or weeds, repairing or demolishing a structure or fence, removing debris, or other form of property upkeep or maintenance performed by or at the request of the owner of the property.

    (1)  the property:
    
    (A)  is in the county;
    
    (B)  is not in a municipality;  and
