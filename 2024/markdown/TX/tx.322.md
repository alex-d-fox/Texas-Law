    SUBCHAPTER B. ASSESSMENT AND COMPUTATION OF TAXES
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 322.101.  SALES TAX.  There is imposed in a taxing entity a sales tax at the rate authorized and set as provided by the law authorizing the creation of the taxing entity and applied to the receipts from the sale within the entity area of all taxable items that are subject to the sales tax under Chapter [151](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=151).
    
    
    
    
    Added by Acts 1987, 70th Leg., ch. 191, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1987.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 322.102.  USE TAX.  In a taxing entity, there is imposed an excise tax on the use, storage, and other consumption within the entity area of taxable items purchased, leased, or rented from a retailer during the period that the sales tax is effective within the entity area.  The rate of the excise tax is the same rate as the rate of the sales tax imposed by the taxing entity and is applied to the sales price of the taxable item.

    Sec. 322.103.  COMPUTATION OF SALES TAXES.  (a)  Each retailer in an entity area shall add the sales tax imposed under this chapter, the sales taxes imposed under Chapter [151](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=151), and, if applicable, any sales taxes imposed under Chapter [321](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=321) or [323](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=323) to the sales price, and the sum of the taxes is a part of the price, a debt of the purchaser to the retailer until paid, and recoverable at law in the same manner as the purchase price.
    
    (b)  The amount of the total tax is computed by multiplying the combined applicable tax rates by the amount of the sales price.  If the product results in a fraction of a cent less than one-half of one cent, the fraction of a cent is not collected.  If the fraction is one-half of one cent or more, the fraction shall be collected as one cent.
    
    (c)  The exclusion provided by Section [151.411](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=151.411) applies to a retailer under this chapter 50 percent of whose receipts from the sales of taxable items comes from individual transactions in which the sales price is an amount on which no tax is produced from the combined applicable tax rates.

    Sec. 322.104.  COMPUTATION OF USE TAX.  (a)  In each taxing entity the tax imposed by Subchapter D, Chapter [151](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=151), the tax imposed under Section [321.104](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=321.104)(a), if applicable, and the tax imposed under Section [322.102](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=322.102) are added together to form a single combined tax rate, except in a situation described by Section [322.105](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=322.105)(b).
    
    (b)  The formula prescribed by Section [322.103](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=322.103)(b) applies to the computation of the amount of the tax under this section.

    Sec. 322.105.  USE TAX:  WHERE USE OCCURS.  (a)  In determining the incidence of the use tax of a taxing entity, the name of the taxing entity is substituted in Subchapter D, Chapter [151](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=151), for "this state" where those words are used to designate the taxing entity or delimit the tax imposed.  However, the excise tax of a taxing entity on the use, storage, or other consumption of a taxable item does not apply if the item is first used, stored, or consumed in an area other than an entity area.
    
    (b)  If a sale of a taxable item is consummated within this state but not within an entity area and the item is shipped directly or brought by the purchaser or lessee directly into an entity area, the item is subject to the entity's use tax.  The use is considered to be consummated at the location where the item is first used, stored, or consumed after the intrastate transit has ceased.
    
    (c)  If a taxable item is shipped from outside this state to a customer within this state, the item is subject to the use tax of the taxing entity and not its sales tax.  A use is considered to be consummated at the first point in this state where the item is stored, used, or consumed after the interstate transit has ceased. A taxable item delivered to a point in this state is presumed to be for storage, use, or consumption at that point until the contrary is established.
    
    (d)  Repealed by Acts 2007, 80th Leg., R.S., Ch. 823, Sec. 1(1), eff. September 1, 2007.
