    "The States of Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas, pursuant to the acts of their respective Governors or legislatures, or both, being moved by considerations of interstate comity, have resolved to compact with respect to the water of the Red River and its tributaries.  By Act of Congress, Public Law No. 346 (84th Congress, First Session), the consent of the United States has been granted for said states to negotiate and enter into a compact providing for an equitable apportionment of such water;  and pursuant to that Act the President has designated the representative of the United States.
    
    "Further, the consent of Congress has been given for two or more states to negotiate and enter into agreements relating to water pollution control by the provisions of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (P.L. 92-500, 33 U.S.C. Subsection 1251 et seq.).
    
    "The Signatory States acting through their duly authorized Compact Commissioners, after several years of negotiations, have agreed to an equitable apportionment of the water of the Red River and its tributaries and do hereby submit and recommend that this compact be adopted by the respective legislatures and approved by Congress as hereinafter set forth:

    "Sec. 11.02. Although affirming the primary duty and responsibility of each Signatory State to take appropriate action under its own laws to prevent, diminish, and regulate all pollution sources within its boundaries which adversely affect the water of the Red River Basin, the states recognize that the control and abatement of the naturally-occurring salinity sources as well as, under certain circumstances, the maintenance and enhancement of the quality of water in the Red River Basin may require the cooperative action of all states.
    
    "Sec. 11.03. The Signatory States agree to cooperate with agencies of the United States to devise and effectuate means of alleviating the natural deterioration of the water of the Red River Basin.

The Commission, however, shall not take any action with respect to pollution which adversely affects only the state in which such pollution originates.
    
    "Sec. 11.07. In addition to its other powers set forth under this Article, the Commission shall have the authority, upon receipt of six concurring votes, to utilize applicable Federal statutes to institute legal action in its own name against the person or entity responsible for interstate pollution problems;  provided, however, sixty (60) days before initiating legal action the Commission shall notify the Governor of the state in which the pollution source is located to allow that state an opportunity to initiate action in its own name.
    
    "Sec. 11.08. Without prejudice to any other remedy available to the Commission, or any Signatory State, any state which is materially and adversely affected by the pollution of the water of the Red River Basin by pollution originating in another Signatory State may institute a suit against any individual, corporation, partnership, or association, or against any Signatory State or political or governmental subdivision thereof, or against any officer, agency, department, bureau, district or instrumentality of or in any Signatory State contributing to such pollution in accordance with applicable Federal statutes.
