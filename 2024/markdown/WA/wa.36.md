Comments may be submitted orally at the hearing or in writing.  The presiding officer may hold the record open for a specified period after the conclusion of the hearing to receive additional written comments.
    
    (g)  A district may require each person who participates in a rulemaking hearing to submit a hearing registration form stating:

    Sec. 36.1072.  TEXAS WATER DEVELOPMENT BOARD REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF MANAGEMENT PLAN.  (a)  In this section, "development board" means the Texas Water Development Board.
    
    (a-1)  A district shall, not later than three years after the creation of the district or, if the district required confirmation, not later than three years after the election confirming the district's creation, submit the management plan required under Section [36.1071](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=36.1071) to the executive administrator for review and approval.
    
    (b)  Within 60 days of receipt of a district's management plan adopted under Section [36.1071](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=36.1071), readopted under Subsection (e) or (g) of this section, or amended under Section [36.1073](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=36.1073), the executive administrator shall approve the district's plan if the plan is administratively complete.  A management plan is administratively complete when it contains the information required to be submitted under Section [36.1071](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=36.1071)(a) and (e).  The executive administrator may determine whether conditions justify waiver of the requirements under Section [36.1071](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=36.1071)(e)(4).
    
    (c)  Once the executive administrator has approved a district's management plan:
    
    (1)  the executive administrator may not revoke but may require revisions to the approved management plan as provided by Subsection (g); and
    
    (2)  the executive administrator may request additional information from the district if the information is necessary to clarify, modify, or supplement previously submitted material, but a request for additional information does not render the management plan unapproved.
    
    (d)  A management plan takes effect on approval by the executive administrator or, if appealed, on approval by the development board.
    
    (e)  The district may review the plan annually and must review and readopt the plan with or without revisions at least once every five years.  The district shall provide the readopted plan to the executive administrator not later than the 60th day after the date on which the plan was readopted.  Approval of the preceding management plan remains in effect until:
    
    (1)  the district fails to timely readopt a management plan;
    
    (2)  the district fails to timely submit the district's readopted management plan to the executive administrator; or
    
    (3)  the executive administrator determines that the readopted management plan does not meet the requirements for approval, and the district has exhausted all appeals to the Texas Water Development Board or appropriate court.
    
    (f)  If the executive administrator does not approve the district's management plan, the executive administrator shall provide to the district, in writing, the reasons for the action.  Not later than the 180th day after the date a district receives notice that its management plan has not been approved, the district may submit a revised management plan for review and approval.  The executive administrator's decision may be appealed to the development board.  If the development board decides not to approve the district's management plan on appeal, the district may request that the conflict be mediated.  The district and the board may seek the assistance of the Center for Public Policy Dispute Resolution at The University of Texas School of Law or an alternative dispute resolution system established under Chapter [152](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=152), Civil Practice and Remedies Code, in obtaining a qualified impartial third party to mediate the conflict.  The cost of the mediation services must be specified in the agreement between the parties and the Center for Public Policy Dispute Resolution or the alternative dispute resolution system.  If the parties do not resolve the conflict through mediation, the decision of the development board not to approve the district's management plan may be appealed to a district court in Travis County.  Costs for the appeal shall be set by the court hearing the appeal.  An appeal under this subsection is by trial de novo.  The commission shall not take enforcement action against a district under Subchapter I until the latest of the expiration of the 180-day period, the date the development board has taken final action withholding approval of a revised management plan, the date the mediation is completed, or the date a final judgment upholding the board's decision is entered by a district court.  An enforcement action may not be taken against a district by the commission or the state auditor under Subchapter I because the district's management plan and the approved regional water plan are in conflict while the parties are attempting to resolve the conflict before the development board, in mediation, or in court.  Rules of the district continue in full force and effect until all appeals under this subsection have been exhausted and the final judgment is adverse to the district.
    
    (g)   A person with a legally defined interest in groundwater in a district, or the regional water planning group, may file a petition with the development board stating that a conflict requiring resolution may exist between the district's approved management plan developed under Section [36.1071](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=36.1071) and the state water plan.  If a conflict exists, the development board shall provide technical assistance to and facilitate coordination between the involved person or regional water planning group and the district to resolve the conflict.  Not later than the 45th day after the date the person or the regional water planning group files a petition with the development board, if the conflict has not been resolved, the district and the involved person or regional planning group may mediate the conflict.  The district and the involved person or regional planning group may seek the assistance of the Center for Public Policy Dispute Resolution at The University of Texas School of Law or an alternative dispute resolution system established under Chapter [152](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=152), Civil Practice and Remedies Code, in obtaining a qualified impartial third party to mediate the conflict.  The cost of the mediation services must be specified in the agreement between the parties and the Center for Public Policy Dispute Resolution or the alternative dispute resolution system.  If the district and the involved person or regional planning group cannot resolve the conflict through mediation, the development board shall resolve the conflict not later than the 60th day after the date the mediation is completed.  The development board action under this provision may be consolidated, at the option of the board, with related action under Section [16.053](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=16.053)(p).  If the development board determines that resolution of the conflict requires a revision of the approved management plan, the development board shall provide information to the district.  The district shall prepare any revisions to the plan based on the information provided by the development board and shall hold, after notice, at least one public hearing at some central location within the district.  The district shall consider all public and development board comments, prepare, revise, and adopt its management plan, and submit the revised management plan to the development board for approval.  On the request of the district or the regional water planning group, the development board shall include discussion of the conflict and its resolution in the state water plan that the development board provides to the governor, the lieutenant governor, and the speaker of the house of representatives under Section [16.051](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=16.051)(e).  If the groundwater conservation district disagrees with the decision of the development board under this subsection, the district may appeal the decision to a district court in Travis County.  Costs for the appeal shall be set by the court hearing the appeal.  An appeal under this subsection is by trial de novo.

    Sec. 36.108.  JOINT PLANNING IN MANAGEMENT AREA.  (a)  In this section:
    
    (1)  "Development board" means the Texas Water Development Board.
    
    (2)  "District representative" means the presiding officer or the presiding officer's designee for any district located wholly or partly in the management area.
    
    (b)  If two or more districts are located within the boundaries of the same management area, each district shall forward a copy of that district's new or revised management plan to the other districts in the management area.  The boards of the districts shall consider the plans individually and shall compare them to other management plans then in force in the management area.
    
    (c)  The district representatives shall meet at least annually to conduct joint planning with the other districts in the management area and to review the management plans, the accomplishments of the management area, and proposals to adopt new or amend existing desired future conditions.  In reviewing the management plans, the districts shall consider:
    
    (1)  the goals of each management plan and its impact on planning throughout the management area;
    
    (2)  the effectiveness of the measures established by each district's management plan for conserving and protecting groundwater and preventing waste, and the effectiveness of these measures in the management area generally;
    
    (3)  any other matters that the boards consider relevant to the protection and conservation of groundwater and the prevention of waste in the management area; and
    
    (4)  the degree to which each management plan achieves the desired future conditions established during the joint planning process.
    
    (d)  Not later than May 1, 2021, and every five years thereafter, the districts shall consider groundwater availability models and other data or information for the management area and shall propose for adoption desired future conditions for the relevant aquifers within the management area. Before voting on the proposed desired future conditions of the aquifers under Subsection (d-2), the districts shall consider:
    
    (1)  aquifer uses or conditions within the management area, including conditions that differ substantially from one geographic area to another;
    
    (2)  the water supply needs and water management strategies included in the state water plan;
    
    (3)  hydrological conditions, including for each aquifer in the management area the total estimated recoverable storage as provided by the executive administrator, and the average annual recharge, inflows, and discharge;
    
    (4)  other environmental impacts, including impacts on spring flow and other interactions between groundwater and surface water;
    
    (5)  the impact on subsidence;
    
    (6)  socioeconomic impacts reasonably expected to occur;
    
    (7)  the impact on the interests and rights in private property, including ownership and the rights of management area landowners and their lessees and assigns in groundwater as recognized under Section [36.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=36.002);
    
    (8)  the feasibility of achieving the desired future condition; and
    
    (9)  any other information relevant to the specific desired future conditions.
    
    (d-1)  After considering and documenting the factors described by Subsection (d) and other relevant scientific and hydrogeological data, the districts may establish different desired future conditions for:
    
    (1)  each aquifer, subdivision of an aquifer, or geologic strata located in whole or in part within the boundaries of the management area; or
    
    (2)  each geographic area overlying an aquifer in whole or in part or subdivision of an aquifer within the boundaries of the management area.
    
    (d-2)  The desired future conditions proposed under Subsection (d) must provide a balance between the highest practicable level of groundwater production and the conservation, preservation, protection, recharging, and prevention of waste of groundwater and control of subsidence in the management area.  This subsection does not prohibit the establishment of desired future conditions that provide for the reasonable long-term management of groundwater resources consistent with the management goals under Section [36.1071](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=36.1071)(a).  The desired future conditions proposed under Subsection (d) must be approved by a two-thirds vote of all the district representatives for distribution to the districts in the management area.  A period of not less than 90 days for public comments begins on the day the proposed desired future conditions are mailed to the districts.  During the public comment period and after posting notice as required by Section [36.063](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=36.063), each district shall hold a public hearing on any proposed desired future conditions relevant to that district.  During the public comment period, the district shall make available in its office a copy of the proposed desired future conditions and any supporting materials, such as the documentation of factors considered under Subsection (d) and groundwater availability model run results.  After the close of the public comment period, the district shall compile and submit to the district representatives for consideration at the next joint planning meeting:
    
    (1)  a summary of relevant comments received;
    
    (2)  any suggested revisions to the proposed desired future conditions, and the basis for those revisions; and
    
    (3)  any supporting materials, including new or revised groundwater availability model run results.
    
    (d-2a)  The information compiled and submitted to the district representatives under Subsection (d-2) must be made available on a generally accessible Internet website maintained on behalf of  the management area for not less than 30 days.
    
    (d-3)  After each district has submitted to the district representatives the information required under Subsection (d-2) and made the information available for the required period of time under Subsection (d-2a), the district representatives shall reconvene for a joint planning meeting to review the information required under Subsection (d-2), consider any district's suggested revisions to the proposed desired future conditions, receive public comment, and finally adopt the desired future conditions for the management area.  The desired future conditions must be approved by a resolution adopted by a two-thirds vote of all the district representatives not later than January 5, 2022.  Subsequent desired future conditions must be proposed and finally adopted by the district representatives before the end of each successive five-year period after that date.  The district representatives shall produce a desired future conditions explanatory report for the management area and submit to the development board and each district in the management area proof that notice was posted for the joint planning meeting, a copy of the resolution, and a copy of the explanatory report.  The report must:
    
    (1)  identify each desired future condition;
    
    (2)  provide the policy and technical justifications for each desired future condition;
    
    (3)  include documentation that the factors under Subsection (d) were considered by the districts and a discussion of how the adopted desired future conditions impact each factor;
    
    (4)  list other desired future condition options considered, if any, and the reasons why those options were not adopted; and
    
    (5)  discuss reasons why recommendations made by advisory committees and relevant public comments received by the districts during the public comment period or at the joint planning meeting were or were not incorporated into the desired future conditions.
    
    (d-4)  After a district receives notification from the Texas Water Development Board that the desired future conditions resolution and explanatory report under Subsection (d-3) are administratively complete, the district shall adopt the applicable desired future conditions in the resolution and report.
    
    (e)  Except as provided by this section, a joint meeting under this section must be held in accordance with Chapter [551](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=551), Government Code.  Each district shall comply with Chapter [552](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552), Government Code.  The district representatives may elect one district to be responsible for providing the notice of a joint meeting that this section would otherwise require of each district in the management area.  Notice of a joint meeting must be provided at least 10 days before the date of the meeting by:
    
    (1)  providing notice to the secretary of state;
    
    (2)  providing notice to the county clerk of each county located wholly or partly in a district that is located wholly or partly in the management area; and
    
    (3)  posting notice at a place readily accessible to the public at the district office of each district located wholly or partly in the management area.
    
    (e-1)  The secretary of state and the county clerk of each county described by Subsection (e) shall post notice of the meeting in the manner provided by Section [551.053](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=551.053), Government Code.
    
    (e-2)  Notice of a joint meeting must include:
    
    (1)  the date, time, and location of the meeting;
    
    (2)  a summary of any action proposed to be taken;
    
    (3)  the name of each district located wholly or partly in the management area; and
    
    (4)  the name, telephone number, and address of one or more persons to whom questions, requests for additional information, or comments may be submitted.
    
    (e-3)  The failure or refusal of one or more districts to post notice for a joint meeting under Subsection (e)(3) does not invalidate an action taken at the joint meeting.

    (o)  If the district vacates or modifies the proposal for decision, the district shall issue a report describing in detail the district's reasons for disagreement with the administrative law judge's findings of fact and conclusions of law.  The report shall provide the policy, scientific, and technical justifications for the district's decision.
    
    (p)  If the district in its final order finds that a desired future condition is unreasonable, not later than the 60th day after the date of the final order, the districts in the same management area as the district that received the petition shall reconvene in a joint planning meeting for the purpose of revising the desired future condition.  The districts in the management area shall follow the procedures in Section [36.108](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=36.108) to adopt new desired future conditions applicable to the district that received the petition.
    
    (q)  A final order by the district finding that a desired future condition is unreasonable does not invalidate the adoption of a desired future condition by a district that did not participate as a party in the hearing conducted under this section.
    
    (r)  The administrative law judge may consolidate hearings requested under this section that affect two or more districts.  The administrative law judge shall prepare separate findings of fact and conclusions of law for each district included as a party in a multidistrict hearing.

    (a-1)  A district may not require a permit or a permit amendment for maintenance or repair of a well if the maintenance or repair does not increase the production capabilities of the well to more than its authorized or permitted production rate.
    
    (b)  A district shall require that an application for a permit or a permit amendment be in writing and sworn to.
    
    (c)  A district may require that only the following be included in the permit or permit amendment application, as applicable under the rules of the district:
    
    (1)  the name and mailing address of the applicant and the owner of the land on which the well will be located;

    (4)  a water conservation plan or a declaration that the applicant will comply with the district's management plan;
    
    (5)  the location of each well and the estimated rate at which water will be withdrawn;
    
    (6)  a water well closure plan or a declaration that the applicant will comply with well plugging guidelines and report closure to the commission;
    
    (7)  a drought contingency plan; and
    
    (8)  other information:
    
    (A)  included in a rule of the district in effect on the date the application is submitted that specifies what information must be included in an application for a determination of administrative completeness; and

    (d)  This subsection does not apply to the renewal of an operating permit issued under Section [36.1145](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=36.1145).  Before granting or denying a permit, or a permit amendment issued in accordance with Section [36.1146](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=36.1146), the district shall consider whether:
    
    (1)  the application conforms to the requirements prescribed by this chapter and is accompanied by the prescribed fees;
    
    (2)  the proposed use of water unreasonably affects existing groundwater and surface water resources or existing permit holders;
    
    (3)  the proposed use of water is dedicated to any beneficial use;
    
    (4)  the proposed use of water is consistent with the district's approved management plan;
    
    (5)  if the well will be located in the Hill Country Priority Groundwater Management Area, the proposed use of water from the well is wholly or partly to provide water to a pond, lake, or reservoir to enhance the appearance of the landscape;
    
    (6)  the applicant has agreed to avoid waste and achieve water conservation; and
    
    (7)  the applicant has agreed that reasonable diligence will be used to protect groundwater quality and that the applicant will follow well plugging guidelines at the time of well closure.
    
    (e)  The district may impose more restrictive permit conditions on new permit applications and permit amendment applications to increase use by historic users if the limitations:
    
    (1)  apply to all subsequent new permit applications and permit amendment applications to increase use by historic users, regardless of type or location of use;
    
    (2)  bear a reasonable relationship to the existing district management plan; and
    
    (3)  are reasonably necessary to protect existing use.
    
    (f)  This subsection does not apply to the renewal of an operating permit issued under Section [36.1145](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=36.1145).  Permits, and permit amendments issued in accordance with Section [36.1146](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=36.1146), may be issued subject to the rules promulgated by the district and subject to terms and provisions with reference to the drilling, equipping, completion, alteration, or operation of, or production of groundwater from, wells or pumps that may be necessary to prevent waste and achieve water conservation, minimize as far as practicable the drawdown of the water table or the reduction of artesian pressure, lessen interference between wells, or control and prevent subsidence.
    
    (h)  In issuing a permit for an existing or historic use, a district may not discriminate between land that is irrigated for production and land or wells on land that was irrigated for production and enrolled or participating in a federal conservation program.
    
    (i)  A permitting decision by a district is void if:
    
    (1)  the district makes its decision in violation of Subsection (h); and
    
    (2)  the district would have reached a different decision if the district had treated land or wells on land that was irrigated for production and enrolled or participating in a federal conservation program the same as land irrigated for production.

    (b)  Except as provided by this section, a landowner or other person who has a right to produce groundwater from land that is adjacent to the land on which a well or wells are drilled or operated without a required permit or permits or from which groundwater is produced in violation of a district rule adopted under Section [36.116](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=36.116)(a)(2), or who owns or otherwise has a right to produce groundwater from land that lies within one-half mile of the well or wells, may sue the owner of the well or wells in a court of competent jurisdiction to restrain or enjoin the illegal drilling, operation, or both.  The suit may be brought with or without the joinder of the district.
    
    (c)  Except as provided by this section, the aggrieved party may also sue the owner of the well or wells for damages for injuries suffered by reason of the illegal operation or production and for other relief to which the party may be entitled.  In a suit for damages against the owner of the well or wells, the existence of a well or wells drilled without a required permit or the operation of a well or wells in violation of a district rule adopted under Section [36.116](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=36.116)(a)(2) is prima facie evidence of illegal drainage.
    
    (d)  The suit may be brought in the county where the illegal well is located or in the county where all or part of the affected land is located.
    
    (e)  The remedies provided by this section are cumulative of other remedies available to the individual or the district.
    
    (f)  A suit brought under this section shall be advanced for trial and determined as expeditiously as possible.  The court shall not grant a postponement or continuance, including a first motion, except for reasons considered imperative by the court.
    
    (g)  Before filing a suit under Subsection (b) or (c), an aggrieved party must file a written complaint with the district having jurisdiction over the well or wells drilled or operated without a required permit or in violation of a district rule.  The district shall investigate the complaint and, after notice and hearing and not later than the 90th day after the date the written complaint was received by the district, the district shall determine, based on the evidence presented at the hearing, whether a district rule has been violated.  The aggrieved party may only file a suit under this section on or after the 91st day after the date the written complaint was received by the district.
    
    (h)  Notwithstanding Subsection (g), an aggrieved party under Subsection (b) may sue a well owner or well driller in a court of competent jurisdiction to restrain or enjoin the drilling or completion of an illegal well after filing the written complaint with the district under Subsection (g) and without the need to wait for a hearing on the matter.

The fee may not exceed fees that the district imposes for processing other applications under Section [36.113](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=36.113).  An application filed to comply with this section shall be considered and processed under the same procedures as other applications for permits under Section [36.113](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=36.113) and shall be combined with applications filed to obtain a permit for in-district water use under Section [36.113](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=36.113) from the same applicant.

    (e-2)  A district governed by a special law in regard to an export fee or surcharge on water exported from the district may charge an export fee or surcharge in accordance with that special law or in accordance with Subsections (e) and (e-1).

    (f)  In reviewing a proposed transfer of groundwater out of the district, the district shall consider:
    
    (1)  the availability of water in the district and in the proposed receiving area during the period for which the water supply is requested;
    
    (2)  the projected effect of the proposed transfer on aquifer conditions, depletion, subsidence, or effects on existing permit holders or other groundwater users within the district; and
    
    (3)  the approved regional water plan and approved district management plan.

    (i)  The period specified by Subsection (h)(2) shall be:
    
    (1)  at least three years if construction of a conveyance system has not been initiated prior to the issuance of the permit;  or
    
    (2)  at least 30 years if construction of a conveyance system has been initiated prior to the issuance of the permit.
    
    (j)  A term under Subsection (i)(1) shall automatically be extended to the terms agreed to under Subsection (i)(2) if construction of a conveyance system is begun before the expiration of the initial term.
    
    (j-1)  A district shall extend a term under Subsection (i)(2) or (j) on or before its expiration in the manner prescribed by Section [36.1145](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=36.1145):
    
    (1)  to a term that is not shorter than the term of an operating permit for the production of water to be transferred that is in effect at the time of the extension; and
    
    (2)  for each additional term for which that operating permit for production is renewed under Section [36.1145](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=36.1145) or remains in effect under Section [36.1146](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=36.1146). 
    
    (j-2)  A permit extended under Subsection (j-1) continues to be subject to conditions contained in the permit as issued before the extension.
    
    (k)  Notwithstanding the period specified under Subsection (i), (j), or (j-1) during which water may be transferred under a permit, a district may periodically review the amount of water that may be transferred under the permit and may limit the amount if additional factors considered in Subsection (f) warrant the limitation, subject to Subsection (c).  The review described by this subsection may take place not more frequently than the period provided for the review or renewal of regular permits issued by the district.  In its determination of whether to renew a permit issued under this section, the district shall consider relevant and current data for the conservation of groundwater resources and shall consider the permit in the same manner it would consider any other permit in the district.
    
    (l)  A district is prohibited from using revenues obtained under Subsection (e) to prohibit the transfer of groundwater outside of a district.  A district is not prohibited from using revenues obtained under Subsection (e) for paying expenses related to enforcement of this chapter or district rules.
    
    (m)  A district may not prohibit the export of groundwater if the purchase was in effect on or before June 1, 1997.
    
    (n)  This section applies only to a transfer of water that is permitted after September 1, 1997.
    
    (o)  A district shall adopt rules as necessary to implement this section but may not adopt rules expressly prohibiting the export of groundwater.
    
    (p)  Subsections (e), (e-1), and (e-2) do not apply to a district that is collecting an export fee or surcharge on March 1, 2001.
    
    (q)  In applying this section, a district must be fair, impartial, and nondiscriminatory.
    
    (r)  The district may grant or deny an application to extend a term under Subsection (i)(2) or (j) submitted under this section only using rules that were in effect at the time the application was submitted.
    
    (s)  An application to extend a term under Subsection (i)(2) or (j) is governed solely by district rules consistent with Subsection (j-1).
