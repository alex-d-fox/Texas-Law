    Article III
    
      
    
    
    All rights to any of the waters of Canadian River which have been perfected by beneficial use are hereby recognized and affirmed.

    (b)  New Mexico shall have free and unrestricted use of all waters originating in the drainage basin of Canadian River in New Mexico below Conchas Dam, provided that the amount of conservation storage in New Mexico available for impounding these waters which originate in the drainage basin of Canadian River below Conchas Dam shall be limited to an aggregate of two hundred thousand (200,000) acre-feet.
    
    (c)  The right of New Mexico to provide conservation storage in the drainage basin of North Canadian River shall be limited to the storage of such water as at the time may be unappropriated under the laws of New Mexico and of Oklahoma.

    (a)  The right of Texas to impound any of the waters of North Canadian River shall be limited to storage on tributaries of said River in Texas for municipal uses, for household and domestic uses, livestock watering, and the irrigation of lands which are cultivated solely for the purpose of providing food and feed for the householders and domestic livestock actually living or kept on the property.
    
    (b)  Until more than three hundred thousand (300,000) acre-feet of conservation storage shall be provided in Oklahoma, exclusive of reservoirs in the drainage basin of North Canadian River and exclusive of reservoirs in the drainage basin of Canadian River east of the 97th meridian, the right of Texas to retain water in conservation storage, exclusive of waters of North Canadian River, shall be limited to five hundred thousand (500,000) acre-feet;  thereafter the right of Texas to impound and retain such waters in storage shall be limited to an aggregate quantity equal to two hundred thousand (200,000) acre-feet plus whatever amount of water shall be at the same time in conservation storage in reservoirs in the drainage basin of Canadian River in Oklahoma, exclusive of reservoirs in the drainage basin of North Canadian River and exclusive of reservoirs east of the 97th meridian;  and for the purpose of determining the amount of water in conservation storage, the maximum quantity of water in storage following each flood or series of floods shall be used;  provided, that the right of Texas to retain and use any quantity of water previously impounded shall not be reduced by any subsequent application of the provisions of this paragraph (b).
    
    (c)  Should Texas for any reason impound any amount of water greater than the aggregate quantity specified in paragraph (b) of this Article, such excess shall be retained in storage until under the provisions of said paragraph Texas shall become entitled to its use;  provided, that, in event of spill from conservation storage, any such excess shall be reduced by the amount of such spill from the most easterly reservoir on Canadian River in Texas;  provided further, that all such excess quantities in storage shall be reduced monthly to compensate for reservoir losses in proportion to the total amount of water in the reservoir or reservoirs in which such excess water is being held;  and provided further that on demand by the Commissioner for Oklahoma the remainder of any such excess quantity of water in storage shall be released into the channel of Canadian River at the greatest rate practicable.

Such fund shall be initiated and maintained by equal payments of each State into the fund in such amounts as will be necessary for administration of this Compact.  Disbursements shall be made from said fund in such manner as may be authorized by the Commission.  Said fund shall not be subject to the audit and accounting procedures of the States.  However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Commission shall be audited by a qualified independent public accountant at regular intervals and the report of the audit shall be included in and become a part of the annual report of the Commission.
    
    (c)  The Commission may:
    
    (1)  Employ such engineering, legal, clerical, and other personnel as in its judgment may be necessary for the performance of its functions under this Compact;
    
    (2)  Enter into contracts with appropriate Federal agencies for the collection, correlation, and presentation of factual data, for the maintenance of records, and for the preparation of reports;
    
    (3)  Perform all functions required of it by this Compact and do all things necessary, proper, or convenient in the performance of its duties hereunder, independently or in cooperation with appropriate governmental agencies.

    (2)  Make and transmit to the Governors of the signatory States on or before the last day of March of each year, a report covering the activities of the Commission for the preceding year;
    
    (3)  Make available to the Governor of any signatory state, on his request, any information within its possession at any time, and shall always provide access to its records by the Governors of the States, or their representatives, or by authorized representatives of the United States.
    
    Article X

    (a)  Affecting the obligations of the United States to the Indian Tribes;
    
    (b)  Subjecting any property of the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, to taxation by any State or subdivision thereof, or creating any obligation on the part of the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, by reason of the acquisition, construction or operation of any property or works of whatever kind, to make any payment to any State or political subdivision thereof, state agency, municipality or entity whatsoever, in reimbursement for the loss of taxes;
    
    (c)  Subjecting any property of the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, to the laws of any State to an extent other than the extent to which such laws would apply without regard to this Compact;
    
    (d)  Applying to, or interfering with, the right or power of any signatory State to regulate within its boundaries the appropriation, use and control of water, not inconsistent with its obligations under this Compact;
    
    (e)  Establishing any general principle or precedent applicable to other interstate streams.
    
    Article XI
    
      
    
    
    This Compact shall become binding and obligatory when it shall have been ratified by the Legislature of each State and approved by the Congress of the United States.  Notice of ratification by the Legislature of each State shall be given by the Governor of that State to the Governors of the other States and to the President of the United States.  The President is hereby requested to give notice to the Governor of each State of approval by the Congress of the United States.
    
    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, The Commissioners have executed four (4) counterparts hereof, each of which shall be and constitute an original, one (1) of which shall be deposited in the archives of the Department of State of the United States, and (1) of which shall be forwarded to the Governor of each State.
