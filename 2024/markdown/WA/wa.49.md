    Sec. 49.060.  FEES OF OFFICE;  REIMBURSEMENT.  (a)  A director is entitled to receive fees of office for each day the director actually spends performing the duties of a director. The board by resolution shall set the fees of office. The board may not set the fees of office at an amount greater than the amount of the per diem set by the Texas Ethics Commission for members of the legislature under Section [24a](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=3.24a), Article III, Texas Constitution. In this subsection, "performing the duties of a director" means substantive performance of the management or business of the district, including participation in board and committee meetings and other activities involving the substantive deliberation of district business and in pertinent educational programs.

    Sec. 49.062.  OFFICES AND MEETING PLACES.  (a)  The board shall designate from time to time and maintain one or more regular offices for conducting the business of the district and maintaining the records of the district.  Such offices may be located either inside or outside the district's boundaries as determined in the discretion of the board.
    
    (b)  Except as provided by Subsection (b-1), the board shall designate one or more places inside or outside the district for conducting the meetings of the board. The meeting place may be a private residence or office, provided that the board, in its order establishing the meeting place, declares the same to be a public place and invites the public to attend any meeting of the board. If the board establishes a meeting place or places outside the district, it shall give notice of the location or locations by filing a true copy of the resolution establishing the location or locations of the meeting place or places and a justification of why the meeting will not be held in the district or within 10 miles of the boundary of the district, if applicable, with the commission and also by publishing notice of the location or locations in a newspaper of general circulation in the district. If the location of any of the meeting places outside the district is changed, notice of the change shall be given in the same manner.
    
    (b-1)  In this subsection, "rural area district" means a district in which more than half of the district's projected retail water or sewer connections are active and that is not wholly or partly located in a county that as of the 2010 Census had a population of 800,000 or more or bordered a county with a population of 800,000 or more.  If the board of a rural area district conducts meetings at least quarterly, the board shall conduct a meeting at a designated meeting location inside the district or within 10 miles of the boundary of the district at least once per quarter.  If the board determines that it is not practical to meet within 10 miles of the boundary of the district, the district may conduct the quarterly meeting at another designated meeting place in the county in which the district is located.
    
    (c)  After at least 50 qualified electors are residing in a district, on written request of at least five of those electors, the board shall designate a meeting place and hold meetings within the district.  If no suitable meeting place exists inside the district, the board may designate a meeting place outside the district that is located not further than 10 miles from the boundary of the district.
    
    (c-1)  On the failure, after a request is made under Subsection (c), of the board to designate the location of the meeting place within the district or not further than 10 miles from the boundary of the district, five electors may petition the commission to designate a location.  If it determines that the meeting place used by the district deprives the residents of a reasonable opportunity to attend district meetings, the commission shall designate a meeting place inside or outside the district which is reasonably available to the public and require that the meetings be held at such place. 
    
    (d)  Two or more districts may designate and share offices and meeting places.  This section does not apply to special water authorities.
    
    (e)  After holding a meeting at a place designated under Subsection (c) or (c-1), the board may hold a hearing on the designation of a different meeting place, including a meeting place outside of the district.  The board may hold meetings at the designated meeting place if, at the hearing, the board determines that the new meeting place is beneficial to the district and will not deprive the residents of the district of a reasonable opportunity to attend meetings.  The board may not hold meetings at a meeting place outside the district or further than 10 miles from the boundaries of the district if the board receives a petition under Subsection (c-1).
    
    (f)  The commission shall make a determination under Subsection (c-1) not later than the 60th day after the date the commission receives the petition.
    
    (g)  The commission shall provide information on the commission's Internet website on the process for designation by the commission of a meeting place under Subsection (c-1) and a form that may be used to request that the commission make the designation with submission instructions.

    (d)  A district that is required by law to post notice of a meeting on an Internet website may instead provide the notice to the county clerk of each county in which the district is located to post the notice on the county clerk's or county's Internet website.
    
    (e)  Failure to timely or properly post a notice of a meeting on an Internet website does not prohibit a district from conducting the meeting if the notice required by Section [551.054](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=551.054)(a)(1), Government Code, is posted timely and properly.

    SUBCHAPTER F. ISSUANCE OF BONDS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 49.181.  AUTHORITY OF COMMISSION OVER ISSUANCE OF DISTRICT BONDS.  (a)  A district may not issue bonds to finance a project for which the commission has adopted rules requiring review and approval unless the commission determines that the project is feasible and issues an order approving the issuance of the bonds.  This section does not apply to:
    
    (1)  refunding bonds if the commission issued an order approving the issuance of the bonds or notes that originally financed the project;
    
    (2)  refunding bonds that are issued by a district under an agreement between the district and a municipality allowing the issuance of the district's bonds to refund bonds issued by the municipality to pay the cost of financing facilities;
    
    (3)  bonds issued to and approved by:
    
    (A)  the Farmers Home Administration;
    
    (B)  the United States Department of Agriculture;
    
    (C)  the North American Development Bank;
    
    (D)  the Texas Water Development Board; or
    
    (E)  a federally chartered instrumentality of the United States authorized under 12 U.S.C. Section 2128(f) to finance such a project, provided that the district that issues the bonds is located wholly in a county that:
    
    (i)  does not contain a municipality that has a population of more than 750,000; and
    
    (ii)  is not adjacent to a county described by Subparagraph (i);
    
    (4)  refunding bonds issued to refund bonds described by Subdivision (3); or
    
    (5)  bonds issued by a public utility agency created under Chapter [572](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=572), Local Government Code, any of the public entities participating in which are districts if at least one of those districts is a district described by Subsection (h)(1)(E).
    
    (b)  A district may submit to the commission a written application for investigation of feasibility.  An engineer's report describing the project, including the data, profiles, maps, plans, and specifications prepared in connection with the report, must be submitted with the application.
    
    (c)  The executive director shall examine the application and the report and shall inspect the project area.  The district shall, on request, supply the executive director with additional data and information necessary for an investigation of the application, the engineer's report, and the project.
    
    (d)  The executive director shall prepare a written report on the project and include suggestions, if any, for changes or improvements in the project.  The executive director shall retain a copy of the report and send a copy of the report to both the commission and the district.
    
    (e)  The commission shall consider the application, the engineer's report, the executive director's report, and any other evidence allowed by commission rule to be considered in determining the feasibility of the project.
    
    (f)  The commission shall determine whether the project to be financed by the bonds is feasible and issue an order either approving or disapproving, as appropriate, the issuance of the bonds.  If the commission determines that an application for the approval of bonds complies with the requirements for financial feasibility and the district submitting the application is not required to comply with rules regarding project completion, the commission may not disapprove the issuance of bonds for all or a portion of a project or require that the funding for all or a portion of a project be escrowed solely on the basis that the construction of the project is not complete at the time of the commission's determination.  The commission shall retain a copy of the order and send a copy of the order to the district.
    
    (f-1)  For the purposes of evaluating the financial feasibility of a project financed by a bond, the commission shall consider:
    
    (1)  a district located wholly or partly in Austin, Brazos, Chambers, Grimes, Liberty, Walker, or Wharton County as if the district were located in Harris County; and
    
    (2)  a district located wholly or partly in Bastrop, Bell, Blanco, Burnet, Caldwell, Gillespie, Kendall, Lee, or Milam County as if the district were located in Travis County.
    
    (g)  Notwithstanding any provision of this code to the contrary, the commission may approve the issuance of bonds of a district without the submission of plans and specifications of the improvements to be financed with the bonds.  The commission may condition the approval on any terms or conditions considered appropriate by the commission.
    
    (h)  This section does not apply to:
    
    (1)  a district if:

    (iv)  the district was not required by law to obtain commission approval of its bonds before the effective date of this section;
    
    (C)  the district is a special water authority;
    
    (D)  the district is governed by a board of directors appointed in whole or in part by the governor, a state agency, or the governing body or chief elected official of a municipality or county and does not provide, or propose to provide, water, sewer, drainage, reclamation, or flood control services to residential retail or commercial customers as its principal function;

    (ii)  has the rights, powers, privileges, and functions applicable to a river authority under Chapter [30](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=30); or

    (i)  An application for the approval of bonds under this section may include financing for payment of creation and organization expenses.  Expenses are creation and organization expenses if the expenses were incurred through the date of the canvassing of the confirmation election.  A commission rule regarding continuous construction periods or the length of time for the payment of expenses during construction periods does not apply to expenses described by this section.
    
    (j)  The commission shall approve an application to issue bonds to finance the costs of spreading and compacting fill to remove property from the 100-year floodplain made by a levee improvement district if the application otherwise meets all applicable requirements for bond applications.
    
    (k)  The commission shall approve an application to issue bonds to finance the costs of spreading and compacting fill to provide drainage that is made by a municipal utility district or a district with the powers of a municipal utility district if the costs are less than the cost of constructing or improving drainage facilities.
    
    (l)  If a district is approved for the issuance of bonds by the commission to use a certain return flow of wastewater, the approval applies to subsequent bond authorizations unless the district seeks approval to use a different return flow of wastewater.

    Sec. 49.231.  STANDBY FEES.  (a)  In this section:
    
    (1)  "Standby fee" means a charge, other than a tax, imposed on undeveloped property for the availability of potable water, sanitary sewer, or drainage facilities and services.
    
    (2)  "Undeveloped property" means a tract, lot, or reserve in the district to which no potable water, sanitary sewer, or drainage connections have been made for which:
    
    (A)  water, sanitary sewer, or drainage facilities and services are available;
    
    (B)  water supply, wastewater treatment plant capacity, or drainage capacity sufficient to serve the property is available;  or
    
    (C)  major water supply lines, wastewater collection lines, or drainage facilities with capacity sufficient to serve the property are available.
    
    (b)  A district that proposes to provide or actually provides retail potable water or sewer utility services, or drainage services as the principal function of the district, may, with the approval of the commission, adopt and impose on the owners of undeveloped property in the district a standby fee in addition to taxes levied by the district.  A district may not impose a standby fee for debt service purposes on undeveloped property unless the facilities and services available to the property have been financed by the district;  however, a district may impose a standby fee for operating and maintaining facilities that it has not financed.  The district may impose standby fees in different amounts to fairly reflect the level and type of services and facilities available to serve different property.  The intent of the standby fee is to distribute a fair portion of the cost burden for operating and maintaining the facilities and for financing capital costs of the facilities to owners of property who have not constructed improvements but have potable water, sewer, or drainage capacity available.  Any revenues collected from the standby fees shall be used to pay operation and maintenance expenses, to pay debt service on the bonds, or both.
    
    (c)  If a district described in Subsection (b) desires to adopt and impose a standby fee, the district shall submit to the commission an application for authority to adopt and impose the standby fee.  The application must describe the tracts of undeveloped property in the district and state the amount of the proposed fee.
    
    (d)  The executive director shall examine an application submitted under Subsection (c) and shall investigate the financial condition of the district, including the district's assets, liabilities, sources of revenue, level of utility service rates, and level of debt service and maintenance tax rates.  On the request of the executive director, the district shall submit any information the executive director considers relevant to the examination and investigation.  The executive director shall prepare a written report on the application and the district's financial condition, retain a copy of the report, and send a copy of the report to the commission and the district.
    
    (e)  Notice of an application submitted under Subsection (c) shall be published by the district in a form provided by the commission.  The district shall publish notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or counties in which the district is located once a week for two consecutive weeks.  The district shall also send notice of the application by certified mail, return receipt requested, to each owner of undeveloped property in the district.  On the date the application is filed, the district's tax assessor and collector shall certify to the district the names of the persons owning undeveloped land in the district as reflected by the most recent certified tax roll of the district.  Notice of the application must be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to each mortgagee of record that has submitted a written request to be informed of any application for standby fees.  The written request for notice must include the name and address of the mortgagee, the name of the property owner in the district, and a brief property description.  The commission may act on an application without conducting a hearing if a public hearing is not requested by the commission, the executive director, or an affected person in the manner prescribed by commission rule during the 30 days following publication of the notice or receipt of mail containing the notice under this subsection.
    
    (f)  The commission shall consider the application, the report of the executive director, and any other evidence allowed by commission rule.  The commission may approve the application only if the commission finds that the fee is necessary to maintain the financial integrity and stability of the district and fairly allocates the costs of district facilities and services among property owners of the district.
    
    (g)  The commission shall issue an order approving or disapproving the application.  The commission shall retain a copy of the order and send a copy of the order to the district.
    
    (h)  The commission may approve the adoption and imposition of the standby fee for a period of not more than three years.  The imposition of a standby fee may be renewed for additional periods of not more than three years each in the same manner provided in this section for initial approval of the standby fee.
    
    (i)  If approved by the commission, the board by resolution or order may impose an annual standby fee on undeveloped land in the district.
    
    (j)  The board may:
    
    (1)  charge interest, at the rate of one percent a month, on a standby fee not paid in a timely manner in accordance with the resolution or order imposing the standby fee;
    
    (2)  impose a penalty in connection with a standby fee that is not paid in a timely manner in accordance with the resolution or order imposing the standby fee;  and
    
    (3)  refuse to provide potable water, sanitary sewer, or drainage service to the property for which the fee was assessed until all delinquent standby fees on the property, interest on those fees, and all penalties imposed in connection with the delinquent standby fees are fully paid.
    
    (k)  A standby fee imposed under this section is a personal obligation of the person owning the undeveloped property on January 1 of the year for which the fee is assessed.  A person is not relieved of the obligation on transfer of title to the property.  On January 1 of each year, a lien attaches to undeveloped property to secure payment of any standby fee, interest on the fee, and any penalty imposed under this section. The lien has the same priority as a lien for taxes of the district.
    
    (l)  If a standby fee imposed under this section is not paid in a timely manner, a district may file suit to foreclose the lien securing payment of the fee, interest on the fee, and any penalty imposed in connection with the fee or to enforce the personal obligation for the fee, interest on the fee, and any penalty imposed in connection with the fee. In addition to the fee, interest on the fee, and any penalty imposed, the district may recover reasonable costs, including attorney's fees, incurred by the district in enforcing the lien or obligation not to exceed 20 percent of the delinquent fee, interest on the fee, and any penalty.  A suit authorized by this subsection must be filed not later than the fourth anniversary of the date the fee became due.  A fee delinquent for more than four years, interest on the fee, and any penalty imposed are considered paid unless a suit is filed before the expiration of the four-year period.
    
    (m)  Chapter [395](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=395), Local Government Code, does not apply to a standby fee imposed under this section.
    
    (n)  For purposes of title insurance policies issued under the authority of Title 11, Insurance Code, standby fees are considered taxes.
    
    (o)  The amount of the penalty authorized by Subsection (j) is six percent of the amount of the standby fee for the first calendar month the standby fee is delinquent, plus an additional one percent of the amount of the fee for each of the subsequent four months, or portion of each of those months, the fee is unpaid, except that if the fee remains unpaid on the first day of the sixth month after the month in which the fee became due, the amount of the penalty is 12 percent of the amount of the standby fee.
    
    (p)  This subsection applies only to the board of a district that has entered into a contract with an attorney for the collection of unpaid standby fees.  In addition to the penalty authorized by Subsection (j) and in accordance with the resolution or order imposing a standby fee, the board may provide that a standby fee that is not paid in a timely manner is subject to a penalty to defray costs of collection of the unpaid standby fee.  The amount of the additional penalty under this subsection may not exceed 15 percent of the amount of the standby fee, interest on the fee, and any penalty imposed in connection with the fee.  A penalty under this subsection is incurred on the date set by the board.  The penalty may be imposed only if the district or the attorney with whom the district has contracted notifies the property owner of the penalty and the amount of the penalty at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the date the penalty is incurred.  A district that imposes the additional penalty under this subsection may not collect both the additional penalty and the attorney's fees provided by Subsection (l).

The board may grant authority to an official or employee responsible for purchasing or for administering a contract to approve a change order that involves an increase or decrease of $150,000 or less.  The aggregate of the change orders that increase the original contract price by more than 25 percent may be issued only as a result of unanticipated conditions encountered during construction, repair, or renovation or changes in regulatory criteria or to facilitate project coordination with other political entities.  A change order is not subject to the requirements of Subsection (d) or (e).
    
    (j)  The board is not required to advertise or seek competitive bids for the repair of district facilities if the scope or extent of the repair work cannot be readily ascertained or if the nature of the repair work does not readily lend itself to competitive bidding.
    
    (k)  The board may use the reverse auction procedure, as defined by Section [2155.062](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2155.062)(d), Government Code, for purchasing.
    
    (l)  The board is not required to advertise or seek competitive bids for security or surveillance systems or components of or additions to district facilities relating to security or surveillance, including systems used for the prevention of terrorist or criminal acts and incidents or acts of war, if the board finds that doing so would compromise the safety and security of district facilities or residents.

    Sec. 49.276.  PAYMENT FOR CONSTRUCTION WORK.  (a)  The district shall pay the contract price of construction contracts only as provided in this section.
    
    (b)  The district will make progress payments under construction contracts monthly as the work proceeds, or at more frequent intervals as determined by the board or its designee, on estimates approved by the board or its designee.
    
    (c)  If requested by the district or district engineer, the contractor shall furnish a breakdown of the total contract price showing the amount included for each principal category of the work, in such detail as requested, to provide a basis for determining progress payments.  In the preparation of estimates, the district engineer may authorize material delivered on the site and preparatory work done to be considered if the consideration is specifically authorized by the contract and if the contractor furnishes satisfactory evidence that he has acquired title to the material and that it will be utilized on the work covered by the contract.
    
    (d)  In making progress payments, 10 percent of the estimated amount shall be retained until final completion and acceptance of the contract work.  However, if the board at any time after 50 percent of the work has been completed finds that satisfactory progress is being made, it may authorize any of the remaining progress payments to be made in full.  Also, if the work is substantially complete, the board, if it finds the amount retained to be in excess of the amount adequate for the protection of the district, at its discretion may release to the contractor all or a portion of the excess amount.  The district is not obligated to pay interest on amounts retained except as provided herein.  The district shall not be obligated to pay any interest on the 10 percent retainage held on the first 50 percent of work completed.  If the district holds any retainage on the remaining 50 percent of the work completed, the district shall pay interest on such retainage from the date the retainage is withheld to the date of payment to the contractor.  The interest rate to be paid on such retainage shall be the rate of interest paid by the district's depository bank on interest bearing accounts of similar amounts during the period of time interest accrues as provided herein.
    
    (e)  On completion and acceptance of each separate project, public work, or other division of the contract, on which the price is stated separately in the contract, payment may be made without retention of a percentage.

    Sec. 49.301.  ADDING LAND BY PETITION OF LANDOWNER.  (a)  In addition to any other provision provided by law, the owner or owners of land whether or not contiguous to the district or otherwise may file with the board a petition requesting that there be included in the district the land described in the petition by metes and bounds or by lot and block number if there is a recorded plat of the area to be included in the district.  The petition may request the district to condition the annexation on certain conditions, including the voter authorization of bonds to serve the area to be annexed.
    
    (b)  If the district has bonds, notes, or other obligations outstanding or bonds payable in whole or in part from taxes that have been voted but are unissued, the board shall require the petitioner or petitioners to assume their share of the outstanding bonds, notes, or other obligations and the voted but unissued tax bonds of the district and authorize the board to levy a tax on their property in each year while any of the bonds, notes, or other obligations payable in whole or in part from taxation are outstanding to pay their share of the indebtedness.

    (d)  The board shall hear and consider the petition and may add to the district the land described in the petition if it is feasible, practicable, and to the advantage of the district and if the district's system and other improvements of the district are sufficient or will be sufficient to supply the added land without injuring land already in the district.
    
    (e)  If the district has bonds payable in whole or in part from taxation that are voted but unissued at the time of an annexation and the petitioners assume the bonds and authorize the district to levy a tax on their property to pay the bonds, then the board may issue the voted but unissued bonds even though the boundaries of the district have been altered since the authorization of the bonds.
    
    (f)  Granted petitions shall be filed for record and shall be recorded in the office of the county clerk of the county or counties in which the added land is located.
    
    (g)  An order issued by the board under this section is not required to include all of the land described in the petition if the board determines that a change in the description is necessary or desirable.

    Sec. 49.302.  ADDING LAND BY PETITION OF LESS THAN ALL THE LANDOWNERS.  (a)  In addition to the method of adding land to a district described in Section [49.301](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=49.301), defined areas of land, whether or not they are contiguous to the district, may be annexed to the district in the manner set forth in this section.
    
    (b)  A petition requesting the annexation of a defined area signed by a majority in value of the owners of land in the defined area, as shown by the tax rolls of the central appraisal district of the county or counties in which such area is located, shall describe the land by metes and bounds or by lot and block number if there is a recorded plat of the area and shall be filed with the secretary of the board.
    
    (c)  It shall be the duty of the board to pass an order fixing a time and place at which the petition for annexation shall be heard that shall not be less than 30 days from the day of the order calling the hearing.
    
    (d)  The secretary of the board shall issue a notice setting forth the time and place of the hearing and describing the area proposed to be annexed.  Notice of the hearing shall be given by posting copies of the notice in three public places in the district and in one public place in the area proposed to be annexed for at least 14 days before the day of the hearing and by publishing a copy of the notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or counties in which the area proposed to be annexed is located one time at least 14 days before the day of the hearing.
    
    (e)  If upon the hearing of the petition it is found by the board that the proposed annexation of the area to the district is feasible, practicable, and to the advantage of the district and if the district's system and other improvements of the district are sufficient or will be sufficient to supply the added land without injuring land already in the district, then the board, by order entered in its minutes, may receive the proposed area as an addition to and to become a part of the district.  The order adding the proposed territory to the district need not include all of the land described in the petition if at the hearing a modification or change is found necessary or desirable by the board.
    
    (f)  A copy of the order annexing land to the district, attested by the secretary of the board, shall be filed and recorded in the deed records of the county or counties in which the district is located if the land is finally annexed to the district.
    
    (g)  After the order is recorded the area shall be a component part of the district.
    
    (h)  The annexed area shall bear its pro rata share of all bonds, notes, or other obligations or taxes that may be owed, contracted, or authorized by the district to which it has been added.
    
    (i)  Before the added area shall be subject to all or any part of the bonds, notes, obligations, or taxes created before the annexation of the area to the district, the board shall order an election to be held in the district, as enlarged by reason of the annexation of the area, on the question of the assumption of the bonds, notes, obligations, and taxes by the annexed area.
    
    (j)  At the same election, the board may also submit a proposition on the question of whether the annexed area should assume its part of the bonds of the district payable in whole or in part from taxes that have been voted previously but not yet issued or sold and the levy of an ad valorem tax on all taxable property within the area annexed along with a tax on the rest of the district for the payment of the bonds.
    
    (k)  If the election results favorably, the district shall be authorized to issue its voted but unissued tax bonds even though the boundaries of the district have been changed since the original election approving the bonds.
    
    (l)  At the election called for the purpose of determining whether the annexed area shall assume the bonds, notes, or other obligations or taxes of the district, the board in a separate proposition may also submit the question of whether the board should be authorized to issue bonds payable in whole or in part from taxes to provide service to the area annexed.
    
    (m)  In the event that the district has bonds, notes, or obligations or taxes that may be owed, contracted, or authorized at the time an area is annexed or if the district has voted but unissued bonds payable in whole or in part from taxes at the time of an annexation, the board may provide in its order annexing an area to the district that the annexation will not be complete or final unless the indebtedness, tax or bond, note, or other obligation assumption election results favorably to the assumption of the district's outstanding bonds, notes, or other obligations and voted but unissued bonds.
    
    (n)  If the board elects to submit the question of whether the board should be authorized to issue bonds to provide service to the area annexed, the board may also provide in its order annexing an area to the district that the annexation will not be complete unless the election results favorably to the issuance of bonds to serve the annexed area.
    
    (o)  Whenever an election is ordered to be held in the district for the purpose of the assumption of bonds, notes, or other obligations or taxes or the assumption of voted but unissued bonds by reason of the annexation of any area, then the election shall be held and notice given as provided for bond elections held by the district.
    
    (p)  The district has the same right and duty to furnish service to the annexed land that it previously had to furnish service to other land in the district, and the board shall endeavor to serve all land in the district without discrimination.

    (c)  If a district has no outstanding bonds payable in whole or in part from taxes, the board may hold a hearing on the exclusion of land or other property from the district if a landowner or property owner submits a signed petition to the secretary of the board evidencing the consent of the owners of a majority of the acreage proposed to be excluded and a majority of the taxable property in the district, as reflected by the most recent certified tax roll of the district.
    
    (d)  A district that has previously held an election at which approval was given for the issuance of bonds payable in whole or in part from taxes may not rely on that election for the issuance of the bonds if after the bond election, but before the bonds are issued, land or other property is excluded from the district as provided by this subchapter.  The board must call and hold another bond election and receive voter approval before issuing those bonds.
    
    (e)  A district may not exclude land or other property from the district under this section if the district has issued bonds payable in whole or in part from taxes and those bonds are outstanding.

    (1)  to retain certain land or other property within the district's taxing power would be arbitrary and unnecessary to conserve the public welfare, would impair or destroy the value of the property desired to be excluded, and would constitute the arbitrary imposition of a confiscatory burden;
    
    (2)  to retain any given land or other property in the district and to extend to it, either presently or in the future, the benefits, service, or protection of the district's facilities would create an undue and uneconomical burden on the remainder of the district;  or
    
    (3)  the land desired to be excluded cannot be bettered as to conditions of living and health, provided with water or sewer service, protected from flood, drained, freed from interruption of traffic caused by excess of water on the roads, highways, or other means of transportation serving the land, or otherwise benefited by the district's proposed improvements.

    Sec. 49.3077.  TAX LIABILITY OF EXCLUDED LAND; BONDS OUTSTANDING.  (a)  In this section:
    
    (1)  "Adjusted gross value" means the gross assessed value of property, as of January 1, including land, improvements, and personal property, as determined by the appraisal district for the tax year in which the determination is made, reduced by any state-mandated exemptions but not reduced for any exemptions from taxation that are within the discretion of the governing body of the district.
    
    (2)  "Carry costs" means interest calculated at an annual rate equal to the weighted average interest rate of the district debt that accrues on the excluded land's share of the district debt, with reductions for prior payments, from the later of the exclusion date or the last interest payment date for district debt for which district taxes have been levied and collected to the earlier of:
    
    (A)  the date of the final interest payment on district debt before the next delinquency for the district's tax collection; or
    
    (B)  the earliest dates on which an aggregate amount of district obligations equal to the district debt may be paid at maturity or redeemed at the option of the district, provided the amount is paid in advance of any future district tax levy, using the redemption dates available for the district's outstanding obligations as of the exclusion date.
    
    (3)  "District debt" means the principal outstanding from time to time of the tax-supported debt of the district outstanding on the exclusion date, including debt used to refund district debt outstanding on the exclusion date.
    
    (4)  "Excluded land" means land that is excluded from a district under Section [49.3076](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=49.3076).
    
    (5)  "Excluded land payment" means, with respect to excluded land, the sum of the excluded land's share of district debt plus the carry costs, less any taxes collected by the district under Subsection (b).
    
    (6)  "Excluded land's share of district debt" means the portion of the district debt that is calculated by multiplying the district debt by a fraction the numerator of which is the adjusted gross value of the excluded land on the exclusion date and the denominator of which is the adjusted gross value of all property in the district on the exclusion date.
    
    (7)  "Exclusion date" means the date that the owner files the petition requesting that the excluded land be excluded from the district with the district secretary.
    
    (8)  "Termination date" means the earlier of:
    
    (A)  the date on which the amount of taxes collected from the excluded land equals the excluded land payment; or
    
    (B)  the date on which the excluded land payment is made in full.
    
    (b)  Excluded land that has been pledged as security for any outstanding debt of the district remains pledged for the excluded land's share of district debt until the excluded land payment is paid. A district is entitled to continue to levy and collect debt service taxes on the excluded land until the termination date at the same rate those taxes are levied on the land remaining in the district. From the exclusion date to the termination date, the excluded land remains in the district for the limited purpose of assessment and collection of such taxes. After the termination date, the excluded land is excluded from the district for all purposes, and the district may not levy any further tax on the excluded land.
    
    (c)  The district shall apply the taxes collected on the excluded land only to payment of the excluded land payment, which shall be reduced by the amount of taxes collected.
    
    (d)  A person is entitled to pay to the district the excluded land payment, in whole or in part, at any time on or after the exclusion date by delivering payment to the district tax assessor-collector. If partial payment is made, the payment is credited first against all carry costs due and owing, and any remainder is credited against the excluded land's share of district debt. After a partial payment, carry costs must be calculated and assessed and collected only on the remaining excluded land's share of district debt.

    SUBCHAPTER L. FIRE DEPARTMENTS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 49.351.  FIRE DEPARTMENTS.  (a)  A district providing potable water or sewer services or facilities may, separately or jointly with another district, municipality, or other political subdivision, establish, operate, and maintain, finance with ad valorem taxes, mandatory fees, or voluntary contributions, and issue bonds for a fire department to perform all fire-fighting services within the district as provided in this subchapter and may provide for the construction and purchase of necessary buildings, facilities, land, and equipment and the provision of an adequate water supply.
    
    (b)  After complying with the requirements of this section, the district or districts shall provide an adequate system and water supply for fire-fighting purposes, may purchase necessary land, may construct and purchase necessary buildings, facilities, and equipment, and may employ or contract with a fire department to employ all necessary personnel including supervisory personnel to operate the fire department.
    
    (c)  For financing a plan approved in accordance with this section, bonds and ad valorem taxes must be authorized and may be issued or imposed as provided by law for the authorization and issuance of other bonds and the authorization and imposition of other ad valorem taxes of the district.
    
    (d)  Two or more districts may contract to operate a joint fire department for their districts and shall include in the contract a system for joint administration and operation of the fire department, the extent of services to be provided, a method for funding the department from funds of each district, and any other terms and conditions the parties consider necessary.
    
    (e)  A district may contract with any other person to perform fire-fighting services within the district.
    
    (f)  Before a district imposes an ad valorem tax or issues bonds payable wholly or partly from ad valorem taxes to finance the establishment of a fire department, contracts to operate a joint fire department, or contracts with another person to perform fire-fighting services within the district, the district must comply with Subsections (g), (h), and (i).
    
    (g)  A district or districts proposing to act jointly shall develop a detailed plan for the establishment, operation, and maintenance of the proposed department, including a detailed presentation of all financial requirements.  If a district is entering into a contract under Subsection (e), the district shall develop a plan that describes the contract and includes a presentation of the financial requirements under the contract.  A plan required by this subsection may be included in a plan or report otherwise required by this title for the creation of a district or may be submitted to the commission for approval at any time after the creation of the district.
    
    (h)  If a plan was not approved by the commission at the time of the district's creation, after adoption of the plan and any contract by the board, the plan and financial presentation, together with any contract and a written report in a form prescribed by the executive director describing existing fire departments and fire-fighting services available within 25 miles of the boundaries of the district, shall be submitted to the executive director for consideration by the commission under rules adopted by the commission.  Before the commission approves the application, it must find that it is economically feasible for the district to implement the plan and meet the provisions of any contract and shall take into consideration in giving its approval the general financial condition of the district and the economic feasibility of the district carrying out the plan or meeting the obligations of the contract.  A plan approved by the commission as part of the creation of a district does not require further commission approval unless the district materially alters the plan.
    
    (i)  After approval of a plan by the commission, the district shall hold an election to approve the plan, approve bonds payable wholly or partly from ad valorem taxes, and impose ad valorem taxes for financing the plan.  The election may be held in conjunction with an election required by Section [49.102](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=49.102). 
    
    (j)  The operation of a fire department or provision of fire-fighting services is an essential public necessity, and a district may discontinue any and all services, including water and sewer service, to any person who fails to timely pay fire department service fees or any other assessment adopted by the district to support the fire department or the provision of fire-fighting services.
    
    (k)  In this section, "fire-fighting services" means all of the customary and usual services of a fire department, including fire suppression, fire prevention, training, safety education, maintenance, communications, medical emergency services, photography, and administration.
    
    (l)  A district providing potable water or sewer service to household users may, as part of its billing process, collect from its customers a voluntary contribution on behalf of organizations providing fire-fighting services to the district.  A district that chooses to collect a voluntary contribution under this subsection must give reasonable notice to its customers that the contribution is voluntary.  Water and sewer service may not be terminated as a result of failure to pay the voluntary contribution.
    
    (m)  If a customer makes a partial payment of a district bill for water or sewer service and includes with the payment a voluntary contribution for fire-fighting services under Subsection (l), the district shall apply the voluntary contribution first to the bill for water or sewer service, including any interest or penalties imposed.  The district shall use any amount remaining for fire-fighting services.
    
    (n)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a district may not charge a fee to a recreational vehicle park, as defined by Section [13.087](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=13.087), on the basis of connections the park provides for the park's transient customers.  A fee charged to a recreational vehicle park must be based on the park's nonsubmetered master meter connection.

    (f)  The notice required by this section shall be given to the prospective purchaser prior to execution of a binding contract of sale and purchase either separately or as an addendum or paragraph of a purchase contract.  In the event a contract of purchase and sale is entered into without the seller providing the notice required by this subsection, the purchaser shall be entitled to terminate the contract.  If, however, the seller furnishes the required notice at or prior to closing the purchase and sale contract and the purchaser elects to close even though such notice was not timely furnished prior to execution of the contract, it shall be conclusively presumed that the purchaser has waived all rights to terminate the contract and recover damages or other remedies or rights under the provisions of this section.  Notwithstanding any provision of this subchapter to the contrary, all sellers, title companies, real estate brokers, and examining attorneys, and any agent, representative, or person acting on their behalf, shall not be liable for damages under the provisions of either Subsection (o) or (p) or liable for any other damages to any person for:
    
    (1)  failing to provide the notice required by this section to a purchaser prior to execution of a binding contract of a purchase and sale or at or prior to the closing of the purchase and sale contract when the district has not filed the information form and map or plat as required under Section [49.455](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=49.455);  or
    
    (2)  unintentionally providing a notice prescribed by this section that is not the correct notice under the circumstances prior to execution of a binding contract of purchase and sale or at or prior to the closing of the purchase and sale contract.
    
    (g)  The purchaser shall sign the notice or purchase contract including such notice to evidence the receipt of notice.
    
    (h)  At the closing of purchase and sale, a separate copy of such notice with current information shall be executed by the seller and purchaser, acknowledged, and thereafter recorded in the deed records of the county in which the property is located.  For the purposes of this section, all sellers, title companies, real estate brokers, and examining attorneys, and any agent, representative, or person acting on their behalf, shall be entitled to rely on the accuracy of the information form and map or plat as last filed by each district under Section [49.455](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=49.455) or the information contained in or shown on the notice form issued by the district under Section [49.453](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=49.453) in completing the notice form to be executed by the seller and purchaser at the closing of purchase and sale.  Any information taken from the information form or map or plat as last filed by each district and the information contained in or shown on the notice form issued by the district under Section [49.453](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=49.453) shall be, for purposes of this section, conclusively presumed as a matter of law to be correct.  All subsequent sellers, purchasers, title insurance companies, real estate brokers, examining attorneys, and lienholders shall be entitled to rely upon the information form and map or plat filed by the district or the notice form issued by the district under Section [49.453](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=49.453).
    
    (i)  For the purposes of this section, an executory contract of purchase and sale having a performance period of more than six months shall be considered a sale under Subsection (a).
    
    (j)  For the purposes of the notice form to be given to the prospective purchaser prior to execution of a binding contract of sale and purchase, a seller and any agent, representative, or person acting in the seller's behalf may modify the notice by substitution of the words "January 1, ___" for the words "this date" and place the correct calendar year in the appropriate space.  All sellers, and all persons completing the prescribed notice in the sellers' behalf, shall be entitled to rely on the information contained in or shown on the information form and map or plat filed of record by the district under Section [49.455](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=49.455) in completing the prescribed form to be given to the prospective purchaser prior to execution of a binding contract of sale and purchase.  Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (h), any information taken from the information form or map or plat filed of record by the district in effect as of January 1 of each year shall be, for purposes of the notice to be given to the prospective purchaser prior to execution of a binding contract of sale and purchase, conclusively presumed as a matter of law to be correct for the period January 1 through December 31 of such calendar year.  A seller and any persons completing the prescribed notice in the seller's behalf may provide more recent information, if available, than the information contained in or shown on the information form and map or plat filed of record by the district under Section [49.455](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=49.455) in effect as of January 1 of each year in completing the prescribed form to be given to the purchaser prior to execution of a binding contract of sale and purchase.  Nothing contained in the preceding sentence shall be construed to create an affirmative duty on the part of a seller or any persons completing the prescribed notice in the seller's behalf to provide more recent information than the information taken from the information form and map or plat filed of record by the district as of January 1 of each year in completing the prescribed notice to be given to the purchaser prior to execution of a binding contract of sale and purchase.  All subsequent sellers, purchasers, title insurance companies, real estate brokers, examining attorneys, and lienholders shall be entitled to rely upon the information form and map or plat filed by the district.
    
    (k)  If such notice is given at closing as provided in Subsection (h), a purchaser, or the purchaser's heirs, successors, or assigns, shall not be entitled to maintain any action for damages or maintain any action against a seller, title insurance company, real estate brokers, or lienholder, or any agent, representative, or person acting in their behalf, by reason of use by the seller of the information filed for record by the district or reliance by the seller on the filed plat and filed legal description of the district in determining whether the property to be sold and purchased is within the district.  No action may be maintained against any title company for failure to disclose the inclusion of the described real property within a district when the district has not filed for record the information form, map, or plat with the clerk of the county or counties in which the district is located.
    
    (l)  Any purchaser who purchases any real property in a district and who thereafter sells or conveys the same shall on closing of such subsequent sale be conclusively considered as having waived any prior right to damages under this section.
    
    (m)  It is the express intent of this section that all sellers, title insurance companies, examining attorneys, vendors of property and tax information, real estate brokers, and lienholders, and any agent, representative, or person acting on their behalf, shall be entitled to rely on the accuracy of the information form and map or plat as last filed by each district or the information contained in or shown on the notice form issued by the district under Section [49.453](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=49.453), or for the purposes of the notice to be given the purchaser prior to execution of a binding contract of sale and purchase the information contained in or shown on the information form and map or plat filed of record by the district in effect as of January 1 of each year for the period January 1 through December 31 of such calendar year.
    
    (n)  Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (f), if any sale or conveyance of real property within a district is not made in compliance with the provisions of this section, the purchaser may institute a suit for damages under the provisions of either Subsection (o) or (p).
    
    (o)  A purchaser of real property covered by the provisions of this section, if the sale or conveyance of the property is not made in compliance with this section, may institute a suit for damages in the amount of all costs relative to the purchase of the property plus interest and reasonable attorney's fees.  The suit for damages may be instituted jointly or severally against the person, firm, corporation, partnership, organization, business trust, estate, trust, association, or other legal entity that sold or conveyed the property to the purchaser.  Following the recovery of damages under this subsection, the amount of the damages shall first be paid to satisfy all unpaid obligations on each outstanding lien or liens on the property and the remainder of the damage amount shall be paid to the purchaser.  On payment of all damages respectively to the lienholders and purchaser, the purchaser shall reconvey the property to the seller.
    
    (p)  A purchaser of real property covered by the provisions of this section, if the sale or conveyance of the property is not made in compliance with this section, may institute a suit for damages in an amount not to exceed $5,000, plus reasonable attorney's fees.
    
    (q)  A purchaser is not entitled to recover damages under both Subsections (o) and (p), and entry of a final decision awarding damages to the purchaser under either Subsection (o) or (p) shall preclude the purchaser from recovering damages under the other subsection.  Notwithstanding any part or provision of the general or special laws or the common law of the state to the contrary, the relief provided under Subsections (o) and (p) shall be the exclusive remedies for a purchaser aggrieved by the seller's failure to comply with the provisions of this section.  Any action for damages shall not, however, apply to, affect, alter, or impair the validity of any existing vendor's lien, mechanic's lien, or deed of trust lien on the property.
    
    (r)  A suit for damages under the provisions of this section must be brought within 90 days after the purchaser receives the first district tax notice or within four years after the property is sold or conveyed to the purchaser, whichever time occurs first, or the purchaser loses the right to seek damages under this section.
    
    (s)  Notwithstanding any provisions of this subchapter to the contrary, a purchaser may not recover damages of any kind under this section if that person:
    
    (1)  purchases an equity in real property and in conjunction with the purchase assumes any liens, whether purchase money or otherwise;  and
    
    (2)  does not require proof of title by abstract, title policy, or any other proof of title.
