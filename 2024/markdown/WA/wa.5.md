    (A)  a group or association is an affected person unless the group or association identifies, by name and physical address in a timely request for a contested case hearing, a member of the group or association who would be an affected person in the person's own right; or
    
    (B)  a hearing requestor is an affected person unless the hearing requestor timely submitted comments on the permit application.
    
    (b)  At the time an application for a permit or license under this code is filed with the executive director and is administratively complete, the commission shall give notice of the application to any person who may be affected by the granting of the permit or license.

For the purposes of this subsection, "state agency" does not include a river authority.
    
    (c)  At the time an application for any formal action by the commission that will affect lands dedicated to the permanent school fund is filed with the executive director or the commission and is administratively complete, the commission shall give notice of the application to the School Land Board.

Delivery is not complete until the return receipt is signed by the deputy commissioner of the asset management division of the General Land Office and returned to the commission.

    (1)  the identifying number given the application by the commission;

    (4)  the date on which the application was submitted;  and
    
    (5)  a brief summary of the information included in the permit application.
    
    (f)  The notice to the School Land Board under this section shall additionally:
    
    (1)  state the location of the permanent school fund land to be affected;  and
    
    (2)  describe any foreseeable impact or effect of the commission's action on permanent school fund land.
    
    (g)  A formal action or ruling by the commission on an application affecting permanent school fund land that is made without the notice required by this section is voidable by the School Land Board as to any permanent school fund lands affected by the action or ruling.

    Sec. 5.601.  DEFINITIONS.  In this subchapter:
    
    (1)  "Approved implementation program" means an implementation plan identified as part of an approved comprehensive conservation and management plan.
    
    (2)  "Approved comprehensive conservation and management plan" means an estuary management plan that is prepared through the efforts of citizens, organizations, industries, local governments, and state and national agencies working together as part of the National Estuary Program to develop long-term comprehensive conservation and management plans (CCMPs) and that has been approved by the governor of Texas and the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency to protect the environment and the economies of the state and of the regions with estuaries.  The term includes the plans for Galveston Bay and the Coastal Bend estuaries.
    
    (3)  "Implementing agency" means the entity identified for day-to-day administration of an estuary program.  An implementing agency may be a state agency or other local or regional entity, as identified in an approved estuary management plan.
    
    (4)  "National Estuary Program" means the cooperative estuary management program authorized by and developed under Section 320 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. Section 1330), as amended.

State and local government participation in estuary programs to protect natural resources serves a public use and benefit.  The state and the implementing agencies recognize the prerogatives of local governments and the sanctity of private property rights.  No action by an estuary program is intended to usurp the authority of any local government.  A local government's participation in or withdrawal from an estuary program is at the sole discretion of the local government and is subject only to the local government's obligation to complete any financial commitment it has made.

    Sec. 5.753.  STANDARDS FOR EVALUATING AND USING COMPLIANCE HISTORY.  (a)  Consistent with other law and the requirements necessary to maintain federal program authorization, the commission by rule shall develop standards for evaluating and using compliance history that ensure consistency.  In developing the standards, the commission may account for differences among regulated entities.
    
    (b)  The components of compliance history must include:
    
    (1)  enforcement orders, court judgments, and criminal convictions of this state relating to compliance with applicable legal requirements under the jurisdiction of the commission;
    
    (2)  notwithstanding any other provision of this code, orders issued under Section [7.070](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=7.070);

The listing of a notice of violation must be preceded by the following statement prominently displayed:  "A notice of violation represents a written allegation of a violation of a specific regulatory requirement from the commission to a regulated entity.  A notice of violation is not a final enforcement action nor proof that a violation has actually occurred."   A notice of violation administratively determined to be without merit may not be included in a compliance history.  A notice of violation that is included in a compliance history shall be removed from the compliance history if the commission subsequently determines the notice of violation to be without merit.
    
    (d-1)  For purposes of listing compliance history, the commission may not include as a notice of violation information received by the commission as required by Title V of the federal Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C.

The commission may consider the person's classification when using compliance history under Subsection (e).
    
    (b)  Rules adopted under Subsection (a):
    
    (1)  must, at a minimum, provide for three classifications of compliance history in a manner adequate to distinguish among:
    
    (A)  unsatisfactory performers, or regulated entities that in the commission's judgment perform below minimal acceptable performance standards established by the commission;
    
    (B)  satisfactory performers, or regulated entities that generally comply with environmental regulations; and
    
    (C)  high performers, or regulated entities that have an above-satisfactory compliance record;
    
    (2)  may establish a category of unclassified performers, or regulated entities for which the commission does not have adequate compliance information about the site; and
    
    (3)  must take into account both positive and negative factors related to the operation, size, and complexity of the site, including whether the site is subject to Title V of the federal Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. Section 7661 et seq.).
    
    (c)  In classifying a person's compliance history, the commission shall:
    
    (1)  determine whether a violation of an applicable legal requirement is of major, moderate, or minor significance;
    
    (2)  establish criteria for classifying a repeat violator, including:
    
    (A)  setting the number of major, moderate, and minor violations needed to be classified as a repeat violator; and
    
    (B)  giving consideration to the size and complexity of the site at which the violations occurred, and limiting consideration to violations of the same nature and the same environmental media that occurred in the preceding five years; and
    
    (3)  consider:
    
    (A)  the significance of the violation and whether the person is a repeat violator;
    
    (B)  the size and complexity of the site, including whether the site is subject to Title V of the federal Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. Section 7661 et seq.); and
    
    (C)  the potential for a violation at the site that is attributable to the nature and complexity of the site.
    
    (c-1)  The executive director may review, suspend, or reclassify a person's compliance history in accordance with commission rules if the executive director determines that exigent circumstances exist.
    
    (d)  The commission by rule may require a compliance inspection to determine an entity's eligibility for participation in a program that requires a high level of compliance.
    
    (e)  The commission by rule shall provide for the use of compliance history in commission decisions regarding:
