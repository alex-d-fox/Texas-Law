(a)  The legislature finds that it is in the public interest and to the benefit of the general public of the state to encourage and to assist in the planning and construction of projects to develop and conserve the storm water and floodwater as well as the ordinary flows of the rivers and streams of the state, to maintain and enhance the quality of the water of the state, to provide protection to the state's citizens from the floodwater of the rivers and streams of the state, to provide drainage, subsidence control, public beach nourishment, recharge, chloride control, brush control, weather modification, regionalization, and desalination, to provide for the management of aquatic vegetation, and other purposes as provided by law or board rule.
    
    (b)  The legislature finds that the conventional means of financing projects are inadequate to meet current and anticipated needs of the state.  Therefore, it is the further intent of the legislature to provide a means of coordinating the development of projects through the board and to provide political subdivisions the maximum opportunity to finance projects through programs provided by this chapter.  Projects may be in the state or outside the state, provided that out-of-state projects must be funded through a Texas political subdivision or an institution of higher education and must result in water being available for use in or for the benefit of Texas or maintain and enhance the quality of water in Texas.
    
    (c)  The legislature finds that serious health and sanitation problems face the citizens of this state from discharges of untreated and treated waste water into the Rio Grande.  It is the intent of the legislature to provide a means of coordinating and financing the development of waste water treatment projects through cooperative efforts between this state, the United States, and the Republic of Mexico to improve the quality of water being discharged into the Rio Grande.

An obligation to disburse money from the fund, or from a special account established by the board, in accordance with a bond enhancement agreement does not constitute indebtedness of the state.

    (1)  a loan bearing an interest rate of not less than 50 percent of the then-current market rate of interest available to the board;
    
    (2)  a loan to finance a facility under repayment terms similar to the terms of debt customarily issued by the entity requesting assistance but not to exceed the lesser of:
    
    (A)  the expected useful life of the facility; or
    
    (B)  30 years;
    
    (3)  a deferral of loan repayment, including deferral of the repayment of:
    
    (A)  principal and interest; or

    (2)  the proceeds of those bonds were or are required to be used only for the implementation of water projects recommended through the state and regional water planning processes under Sections [16.051](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=16.051) and [16.053](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=16.053); and
    
    (3)  general revenue of the state was appropriated before September 1, 2013, for the payment of debt service on those bonds.
    
    (e)  The board may direct the trust company to enter into bond enhancement agreements with respect to refunding bonds issued by the board to refund bonds issued by the board the proceeds of which have been or are to be used for projects included in the state water plan and which otherwise satisfied the requirements of Subsections (b) and (c).
    
    (f)  The board may not direct the trust company to enter into a bond enhancement agreement with respect to bonds issued by the board the proceeds of which have been or are to be used to make grants.

    (h)  The board may not direct the trust company to enter into a bond enhancement agreement with respect to bonds issued by the board the proceeds of which may be used to provide financial assistance to an applicant unless at the time of the request the applicant has acknowledged its legal obligation to comply with any applicable requirements of:
    
    (1)  federal law relating to contracting with disadvantaged business enterprises; and
    
    (2)  state law relating to contracting with historically underutilized businesses.
    
    (i)  The board may not approve a bond enhancement agreement with respect to bonds issued by the board unless the agreement contains a provision to the effect that if the trust company makes a disbursement under the bond enhancement agreement from the fund to the credit of another fund or account as provided by Section [15.434](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=15.434)(a), the board shall direct the comptroller to transfer an amount not to exceed that amount from the fund or account receiving the payment back to the fund if:
    
    (1)  money is available in the surplus balance in the fund or account for that purpose; and
    
    (2)  the money transferred back to the fund will not cause general obligation bonds that are payable from the fund or account receiving the payment to no longer be self-supporting for purposes of Section [49-j](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=3.49-j)(b), Article III, Texas Constitution.
    
    (j)  For purposes of Subsection (i)(1), the surplus balance of a fund or account that receives a disbursement from the fund under a bond enhancement agreement is the amount of money on deposit in the fund or account, as determined by the board, that is attributable to the general obligation bonds or revenue bonds that are the subject of the bond enhancement agreement, including money received from the sale or other disposition of the board's rights to receive repayment of financial assistance, money received from the sale, transfer, or lease of an acquired facility, money received from the sale of water associated with an acquired facility, and related investment earnings, that exceeds the amount required to pay annual debt service on the bonds and any other amounts specified in the resolution or other proceedings authorizing the bonds and any related obligations.
    
    (k)  The board shall submit each bond enhancement agreement and the record relating to the agreement to the attorney general for examination as to the validity of the agreement.  If the attorney general finds that the agreement has been made in accordance with the constitution and other laws of this state, the attorney general shall approve the agreement and the comptroller shall register the agreement.  If the agreement is not submitted at the same time that the bonds to which it relates are submitted, the agreement shall be treated as a public security solely for the purposes of Section [1202.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=1202.004), Government Code.
    
    (l)  After a bond enhancement agreement has been approved and registered as provided by Subsection (k), the agreement is valid and is incontestable for any cause.
    
    (m)  At the direction of the board, the trust company shall make disbursements from the fund, or from a special account established by the board, in accordance with a bond enhancement agreement in the amounts the board determines are needed for debt service payments on, or for security provisions of, general obligation bonds or revenue bonds issued by the board the proceeds of the sale of which have been deposited in another fund administered by the board, or in an account in that other fund, for use in accordance with this subchapter, after the board considers all other sources available for those purposes in that other fund or account.  Money transferred under this subsection may be deposited into that other fund or into a special account established by the trust company or a corporate trustee that is a trust company or a bank that has the powers of a trust company, as determined by the board.
