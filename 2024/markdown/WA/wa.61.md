The words "navigation district," "district," or "districts" as used in Sections [61.116](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=61.116), [61.117](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=61.117), and [60.038](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=60.038) of the Texas Water Code shall apply to any incorporated city in this state which owns and operates wharves, docks, and other marine port facilities.
    
    (b)  The state, through the School Land Board, may lease these state owned lands or flats to eligible navigation districts only for purposes reasonably related to the promotion of navigation.  The term "navigation" as used herein refers to marine commerce and immediately related activities, including but not limited to port development;  channel construction and maintenance;  commercial and sport fishing;  recreational boating;  industrial site locations;  transportation, shipping, and storage facilities;  pollution abatement facilities;  and all other activities necessary or appropriate to the promotion of marine commerce;  but specifically does not refer to residential development.
    
    (c)  In making application for a lease of state owned lands or flats, the district shall include the following information:
    
    (1)  a description of the lands or flats sought to be leased;
    
    (2)  a plan showing how it proposes to utilize the land and a timetable indicating approximately when such utilization will take place;
    
    (3)  a draft environmental impact statement assessing the effect of the proposed use on the environment, which statement shall generally conform to the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, until such time as the legislature shall impose different requirements;  however, a draft environmental impact statement shall not be required if the proposed use requires no dredging, filling, or bulkheading.  If the proposed use does require dredging, filling, or bulkheading, but  the lease shall be processed as provided in Subsections (d), (e), and (f) of this section without the filing of a draft environmental impact statement if the applicant so requests in writing;  but in such a case, the School Land Board shall include in the lease provisions requiring (i) that the draft environmental impact statement required by federal law be filed with the School Land Board before the district makes any use of such lands or flats which requires dredging, filling, or bulkheading;  (ii) that approval of such use be obtained from the School Land Board after copies of the summary of the draft environmental impact statement and a description of the proposed use are circulated for comment and a hearing held as provided in Subsections (d) and (e) of this section and the School Land Board shall be authorized to give its approval to make such amendments to the lease as may then be deemed necessary by it as a result of information developed in the draft environmental impact statement;  and (iii) that the lease shall cease to be effective at a time specifically stated in the lease unless prior to that time accord concerning environmental issues has been reached between the district and the School Land Board;
    
    (4)  proof satisfactory to the board establishing the public convenience and necessity for acquisition of lands sought to be leased.
    
    (d)  Upon receipt of an application and accompanying information, the School Land Board shall submit copies thereof to the member agencies of the Interagency Council on Natural Resources and the Environment and all other appropriate state agencies for review and comment.  In addition, the board shall submit for review and comment the proposed terms and conditions of the lease.  The board shall allow 30 days for such review and comment, and may extend the review period for an additional 30 days upon written request by the executive director of any state agency.
    
    (e)  Following the expiration of the period provided for review and comment, or following the expiration of the 30 day extension of such period, if applicable, the School Land Board shall cause a hearing to be held in the county in which the land proposed to be leased is located.  Notice of the hearing shall be given by publication for at least three days, not less than two weeks nor more than four weeks prior to the hearing, in the daily paper having the greatest circulation in the county.  Members of the board or their designated representatives shall conduct the hearing, at which any party may offer testimony in support of or in opposition to the application, and the board shall consider the record of the hearing in making a decision on the application.
    
    (f)  After submission of all evidence, the School Land Board shall authorize the issuance or denial of the proposed lease and shall determine the reasonable cost to the district, term of years, special limitations, if any, and other conditions necessary to best serve the interest of the general public.  In establishing the consideration to be paid to the state for the lease, due weight shall be given to the depth of the water over the submerged land, its proximity to development activities, and its proposed use.  Final action shall be taken by the board no more than 60 days following the public hearing.
    
    (g)  The funds derived from the lease shall be paid to the General Land Office for transfer to the proper funds of the state.
    
    (h)  Districts may sublease lands leased from the state under the provisions of this section to third parties for activities reasonably related to navigation, but such sublease shall be subject to the approval of the School Land Board according to the procedures, requirements, and criteria set forth in Subsections (c) and (d) of Section [61.116](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=61.116) of this code;  provided, however, that no approval by the School Land Board shall be required if the sublease is for a purpose contemplated by the district and approved by the board in the district's original lease.  It is further provided that no environmental impact statement shall ever be necessary for any sublease which requires no dredging, filling, or bulkheading, and which would not have a substantial impact upon the environment, or which requires only insubstantial dredging, filling, or bulkheading, as determined by the board;  nor shall a district in obtaining approval for a sublease under any circumstances be required to reveal the name of the tenant to whom the sublease is to be made.
    
    (i)  If lands or flats leased from the state under the provisions of this section are utilized by the district or its sublessee for any purpose or use not approved by the School Land Board, the district shall be given notice and an opportunity to change and correct the use.  If the use is not changed and corrected within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice, the lease may be terminated by the School Land Board and the lands or flats shall revert to the State of Texas.

    (b)  All leases of land under Section [61.116](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=61.116) are subject to oil, gas, or mineral leases in existence at the time of the lease to the district.
    
    (c)  Any land which has been franchised or leased or is being used by any navigation district or by the United States for the purpose of navigation, industry, or other purpose incident to the operation of a port shall not be entered or possessed by the State of Texas or by anyone claiming under the State of Texas for the purpose of exploring for oil, gas, or other minerals except by directional drilling.  No easement, lease, or permit may be granted on land which has been leased to a navigation district which will interfere with the proposed use of the land by the navigation district, and the prior approval of the navigation district shall be obtained for such purpose.
    
    (d)  No surface drilling location may be nearer than 660 feet and special permission from the Commissioner of the General Land Office is necessary to make any surface location nearer than 2,160 feet, measured at right angles from the nearest bulkhead line designated by a navigation district or the United States as the bulkhead line or from the nearest dredged bottom edge of any channel, slip, or turning basin which has been dredged, or which has been authorized by the United States as a federal project for future construction, whichever is nearer.
    
    (e)  In the event land is leased to a navigation district for construction of a navigation project, the School Land Board may in the lease designate the district to be the agent of the State of Texas with authority to grant to the United States of America such easements for dredging and disposal of dredged material as may be required for federal participation in the project.  In designating the district to be the agent of the State of Texas for the purpose of granting spoil easements, the board may include a requirement that the district obtain the approval of the board before granting any such easement.  Such approval may be given in the form of accepting a master plan for spoil disposal.
    
    (f)  Districts which, prior to the enactment of this provision, have obtained patents to state owned lands or flats under Article 8225, Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, 1925, or under any general or special act, and which still claim title to any such lands or flats, may not hereafter dispose of any such lands or flats which were conveyed to them by the State of Texas and may not lease such lands or flats for a use for which districts are not authorized to lease their other lands;  however, in the event a district possesses lands it finds to be in excess of its needs, it may sell such surplus lands or flats back to the State of Texas for the same consideration as originally paid to the state or exchange them for other lands with the State of Texas.  It is further provided that the limitation on resale of lands or flats acquired from the State of Texas shall not prevent a district from exchanging such lands or flats for land, or rights in land, of an adjacent littoral owner for the purpose of adjusting or straightening the boundary between such lands.  All such exchanges made after December 31, 1973, shall be subject to the approval of the School Land Board.
    
    (g)  Any district which, prior to the effective date of this Act has maintained, and which at the effective date of this Act is maintaining, any channel, dredged material disposal site, or other navigational aid or improvement on state owned lands to which the district holds no patent or lease from the state shall notify the General Land Office of the boundaries of such submerged land used by furnishing a map or other drawing acceptable to the General Land Office.
