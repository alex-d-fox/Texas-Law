The increased capacity of the canals of the district shall be sufficient to carry any increase of water caused by the connection without danger to canals and drains or lands adjacent to them.
    
    (b)  The engineer shall supervise and direct the enlargement of the canals and drains, and after the work is completed to his satisfaction, the engineer shall report to the board under his official certificate.  The report shall show:
