    Sec. 60.152.  AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO CONTRACT.  (a)  One or more districts, which are interested in or may, in the judgment of the commission, be benefited by a navigation or other project, may enter into contracts with the United States or with another district, or both, to consummate navigation or other projects of common interest.
    
    (b)  The contract may provide for:
    
    (1)  the assumption of several, joint, or joint and several liability for construction, completion, and consummation of the project;
    
    (2)  the acquisition of property in connection with the project;
    
    (3)  the lending and contribution of funds of the district to the United States or to any other district in support or in aid of the project;
    
    (4)  the issuance of bonds or notes by one or more of the districts to fund all or part of the project;
    
    (5)  the obligation of one or more of the districts to fully or partially reimburse another district that has spent its own funds on the project or has issued bonds or notes to fund the project;
    
    (6)  the securing of bonds or notes issued by one district to fund the project with a pledge of payments to be made by one or more of the other districts;  and
    
    (7)  the assumption of responsibility for valid obligations, incurred in furtherance of the common project, of the United States or of any district.
    
    (c)  A contract may provide that a district will make payment under the contract from proceeds from the sale of bonds or notes, from taxes, or from any other income of the district or any combination of these.  A district may make payments under a contract from taxes other than maintenance taxes, after the provisions of the contract have been approved by a majority of the electors voting at an election held for that purpose.  A contract election may be held alone or at the same time and in conjunction with an election to authorize bonds.  The procedure for calling the election, giving notice, conducting the election, and canvassing the returns is the same as the procedure for a bond election.  If the contract is approved, it constitutes an obligation against the taxing power of the district to the extent provided in the contract.
    
    (d)  A district all or part of which is in another district may exercise the authority granted a district under this section.

    SUBCHAPTER H. PROMOTION AND DEVELOPMENT FUND IN CERTAIN DISTRICTS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 60.201.  PURPOSE.  Districts in this state which operate ports or waterways and harbor and terminal facilities are in keen competition with other ports, waterways, harbors, and terminals outside the state and with privately owned port and terminal facilities inside the state.  Well-situated and well-equipped ports and waterways in other nearby states and owners of substantial port and terminal facilities located inside and outside the state are advertising, promoting and developing their competing ports, waterways, harbors, and terminals through expenditure of large amounts of money without any audit or restriction on expenditure of the money.  This activity or expenditure is thwarting and impeding the use, progress, and development of the ports, waterways, harbors, and terminals of this state.

    (b)  The district shall designate an engineer or architect independent of the design-build firm to act as its representative for the duration of the work on the facility.  If the district's engineer or architect is not a full-time employee of the district, the district shall select the engineer or architect as provided by Section [2254.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2254.004), Government Code.
    
    (c)  The district shall prepare a request for qualifications that includes general information on the project site, project scope, budget, special systems, selection criteria, and other information that may assist potential design-build firms in submitting proposals for the project.  The district shall also prepare a design criteria package that includes more detailed information on the project.  If the preparation of the design criteria package requires engineering or architectural services that constitute the practice of engineering within the meaning of Chapter [1001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=1001), Occupations Code, or the practice of architecture within the meaning of Chapter [1051](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=1051), Occupations Code, those services shall be provided in accordance with the applicable law.  An engineer shall have responsibility for compliance with the engineering design requirements and all other applicable requirements of Chapter [1001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=1001), Occupations Code.  An architect shall have responsibility for compliance with the requirements of Chapter [1051](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=1051), Occupations Code.
    
    (d)  The district shall evaluate statements of qualifications and select a design-build firm in two phases:
    
    (1)  In phase one, the district shall prepare a request for qualifications and evaluate each offeror's experience, technical competence, and capability to perform, the past performance of the offeror's team and members of the team, and other appropriate factors submitted by the team or firm in response to the request for qualifications, except that cost-related or price-related evaluation factors are not permitted.  Each offeror must certify to the district that each engineer or architect who is a member of its team was selected based on demonstrated competence and qualifications, in the manner provided by Section [2254.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2254.004), Government Code.  The district shall qualify a maximum of five offerors to submit additional information and, if the district chooses, to interview for final selection.
    
    (2)  In phase two, the district shall evaluate the information submitted by the offerors on the basis of the selection criteria stated in the request for qualifications and the results of any interview.  The district may request additional information regarding demonstrated competence and qualifications, considerations of the safety and long-term durability of the project, the feasibility of implementing the project as proposed, the ability of the offeror to meet schedules, costing methodology, construction cost, engineering and architectural design, or other factors as appropriate.  The district shall rank each proposal submitted on the basis of the criteria set forth in the request for qualifications.  The district shall select the design-build firm that submits the proposal offering the best value for the district on the basis of the published selection criteria and on its ranking evaluations.  The district shall first attempt to negotiate a contract with the selected offeror.  If the district is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the selected offeror, the district shall, formally and in writing, end negotiations with that offeror and proceed to negotiate with the next offeror in the order of the selection ranking until a contract is reached or negotiations with all ranked offerors end.
    
    (e)  Following selection of a design-build firm under Subsection (d), that firm's engineers or architects shall complete the design, submitting all design elements for review and determination of scope compliance to the district or the district's engineer or architect before or concurrently with construction.
    
    (f)  The district shall provide or contract for, independently of the design-build firm, the inspection services, the testing of construction materials, and the verification testing services necessary for acceptance of the facility by the district.  The district shall select those services for which it contracts in accordance with Section [2254.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2254.004), Government Code.
    
    (g)  The design-build firm shall supply a signed and sealed set of as-built construction documents for the project to the district at the conclusion of construction.
    
    (h)  A payment or performance bond is not required for, and may not provide coverage for, the portion of a design-build contract under this subchapter that includes design services only.  If a fixed contract amount or guaranteed maximum price has not been determined at the time a design-build contract is awarded, the penal sums of the performance and payment bonds delivered to the district must each be in an amount equal to the project budget, as specified in the design criteria package.  The design-build firm shall deliver the bonds not later than the 10th day after the date the design-build firm executes the contract unless the design-build firm furnishes a bid bond or other financial security acceptable to the district to ensure that the design-build firm will furnish the required performance and payment bonds when a guaranteed maximum price is established.
    
    (i)  The district shall pay an unsuccessful design-build firm that submits a response to the district's request for additional information on engineering or architectural design under Subsection (d)(2) the stipulated amount of up to one-half of one percent of the final contract price for any reasonable costs incurred in preparing that proposal.  After payment of the stipulated amount, the district may make use of any design contained in the proposal, including the technologies, techniques, methods, processes, and information contained in the design.  The use by the district of any design element contained in an unsuccessful proposal is at the sole risk and discretion of the district and does not confer liability on the recipient of the stipulated amount under this section.  The methodology for computing the stipulated amount must be stated in the request for additional information under Subsection (d)(2).
    
    (j)  The district may use a design-build firm to assist the district in obtaining a permit necessary for a facility, but the district is responsible for obtaining the permit.
    
    (k)  A successful design-build firm shall not be eligible for another design-build contract with the district for a period of 12 months after the date the successful design-build firm's contract has been completed if:
    
    (1)  the successful design-build firm's contract value exceeds $5 million;  or
    
    (2)  the design-build firm is awarded design-build contracts by a district that total more than $5 million in a 12-month period.

    (e)  If a two-step process is used, the district may not request fees or prices in step one.  In step two, the district may request that five or fewer offerors, selected solely on the basis of qualifications, provide additional information, including the construction manager-at-risk's proposed fee and its price for fulfilling the general conditions.
    
    (f)  At each step, the district shall receive, publicly open, and read aloud the names of the offerors.

Not later than the 45th day after the date of opening the proposals, the district shall evaluate and rank each proposal submitted in relation to the criteria set forth in the request for proposals.
    
    (g)  The district shall select the offeror that submits the proposal that offers the best value for the district based on the published selection criteria and on its ranking evaluation.  The district shall first attempt to negotiate a contract with the selected offeror.  If the district is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the selected offeror, the district shall, formally and in writing, end negotiations with that offeror and proceed to negotiate with the next offeror in the order of the selection ranking until a contract is reached or negotiations with all ranked offerors end.
    
    (h)  If a fixed contract amount or guaranteed maximum price has not been determined at the time the contract is awarded, the penal sums of the performance and payment bonds delivered to the district must each be in an amount equal to the project budget, as specified in the request for proposals or qualifications.  The construction manager-at-risk shall deliver the bonds not later than the 10th day after the date the construction manager-at-risk executes the contract unless the construction manager-at-risk furnishes a bid bond or other financial security acceptable to the district to ensure that the construction manager-at-risk will furnish the required performance and payment bonds when a guaranteed maximum price is established.

The district shall select those services for which it contracts in accordance with Section [2254.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2254.004), Government Code, and shall identify them in the request for proposals.
    
    (d)  The district shall select a contractor through competitive sealed proposals in either a one-step or two-step process.  The district shall prepare a request for competitive sealed proposals, in the case of a one-step process, or a request for qualifications, in the case of a two-step process, that includes construction documents, selection criteria, project scope, schedule, the time and place for receipt of proposals or qualifications, as applicable, a statement as to whether the selection process is a one-step or two-step process, and other information that contractors may require to respond to the request.  The district shall state in the request for proposals or qualifications, as applicable, the selection criteria that will be used in selecting the successful offeror.  If a one-step process is used, the district may request, as part of the offeror's proposal, proposed prices.
    
    (d-1)  If a two-step process is used, the district may not request prices in the first step.  In the second step, the district may request that offerors, selected solely on the basis of qualifications, provide additional information, including proposed prices.
    
    (e)  At each step, the district shall receive, publicly open, and read aloud the names of the offerors.  At the appropriate step, the district shall read aloud the prices, if any, stated in each proposal as the proposal is opened.  Not later than the 45th day after the date of opening the proposals, the district shall evaluate and rank each proposal submitted in relation to the published selection criteria.
    
    (e-1)  Notwithstanding Subsection (e), if the district demonstrates 45 days is not sufficient time for thorough evaluation, the district may specify in the request for competitive sealed proposals a deadline, not later than the 90th day after the date of opening the proposals, to evaluate and rank each proposal submitted in relation to the published selection criteria.
    
    (f)  The district shall select the offeror that offers the best value for the district based on the published selection criteria and on its ranking evaluation.  The district shall first attempt to negotiate a contract with the selected offeror.  The district and its engineer or architect may discuss with the selected offeror options for a scope or time modification and any price change associated with the modification.  If the district is unable to negotiate a contract with the selected offeror, the district shall, formally and in writing, end negotiations with that offeror and proceed to the next offeror in the order of the selection ranking until a contract is reached or all proposals are rejected.
    
    (g)  In determining best value for the district, the district is not restricted to considering price alone, but may consider any other factor stated in the selection criteria.
