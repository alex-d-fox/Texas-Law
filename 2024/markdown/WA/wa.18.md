    Sec. 18.003.  DIVERSIONS OF MARINE SEAWATER.  (a)  A person must obtain a permit to divert and use state water that consists of marine seawater if:
    
    (1)  the point of diversion is located less than three miles seaward of any point located on the coast of this state; or
    
    (2)  the seawater contains a total dissolved solids concentration based on a yearly average of samples taken monthly at the water source of less than 20,000 milligrams per liter.
    
    (b)  A person may divert and use state water that consists of marine seawater without obtaining a permit if Subsection (a) does not apply.
    
    (c)  A person who diverts and uses state water that consists of marine seawater under a permit required by Subsection (a) or as authorized by Subsection (b) must determine the total dissolved solids concentration of the seawater at the water source by monthly sampling and analysis and provide the data collected to the commission.  A person may not begin construction of a facility for the diversion of marine seawater without obtaining a permit until the person has provided data to the commission based on the analysis of samples taken at the water source over a period of at least one year demonstrating that Subsection (a)(2) does not apply.  A person who has begun construction of a facility for the diversion of marine seawater without obtaining a permit because the person has demonstrated that Subsection (a)(2) does not apply is not required to obtain a permit for the facility if the total dissolved solids concentration of the seawater at the water source subsequently changes so that Subsection (a)(2) applies.
    
    (d)  A person may use marine seawater diverted under a permit required by Subsection (a) or as authorized by Subsection (b) for any beneficial purpose, but only if the seawater is treated in accordance with rules adopted by the commission before it is used.  Rules adopted under this subsection may impose different treatment requirements based on the purpose for which the seawater is to be used.
    
    (e)  The commission shall adopt rules providing an expedited procedure for acting on an application for a permit required by Subsection (a). The rules must provide for notice, an opportunity for the submission of written comment, and an opportunity for a contested case hearing regarding commission actions relating to an application for a permit.
    
    (f)  A person may not divert marine seawater under a permit required by Subsection (a) or as authorized by Subsection (b) from a point of diversion located in a bay or estuary.
    
    (g)  An application for a permit required by Subsection (a) must address the points from which, and the rate at which, the facility the applicant proposes to construct will divert marine seawater.
    
    (h)  The commission by rule shall prescribe reasonable measures to minimize impingement and entrainment.
    
    (i)  The Parks and Wildlife Department and the General Land Office jointly shall conduct a study to identify zones in the Gulf of Mexico that are appropriate for the diversion of marine seawater, taking into account the need to protect marine organisms.  Not later than September 1, 2018, the Parks and Wildlife Department and the General Land Office shall submit a report on the results of the study to the commission.  The report must include recommended diversion zones for designation by the commission and recommendations for the number of points from which, and the rate at which, a facility may divert marine seawater.  Not later than September 1, 2020, the commission by rule shall designate appropriate diversion zones.  A diversion zone may be contiguous to, be the same as, or overlap a discharge zone.  The point or points from which a facility may divert marine seawater must be located in a diversion zone designated by the commission under rules adopted under this subsection if:
    
    (1)  the facility is authorized by a permit as required by Subsection (a) issued after the rules are adopted; or
    
    (2)  the facility is exempt under Subsection (b) from the requirement of a permit and construction of the facility begins after the rules are adopted.
    
    (j)  Until the commission adopts rules under Subsection (i), a person must consult the Parks and Wildlife Department and the General Land Office regarding the point or points from which a facility the person proposes to construct may divert marine seawater before submitting an application for a permit for the facility if Subsection (a) applies or before beginning construction of the facility if Subsection (b) applies.
