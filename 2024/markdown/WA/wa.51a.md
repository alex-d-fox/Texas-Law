    (1)  "Board" means the board of directors of a district.
    
    (2)  "Commission" means the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.
    
    (3)  "District" means a conservation and reclamation district that:
    
    (A)  is created by general or special law pursuant to Section [59](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=16.59), Article XVI, Texas Constitution;
    
    (B)  is governed by Chapter [51](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=51) to the extent the provisions of that chapter are not inconsistent with the provisions of any special law creating the district; and

    (4)  "Refunding bond" means a refunding bond issued by a district.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, "residential neighborhood" means an area that, as it develops, will consist of detached single-family residences on not less than 87-1/2 percent of the net residential acreage of the area if the preliminary engineering report adopted by the board before the authorization of bonds stipulates that approximately 87-1/2 percent of the net residential acreage will consist of single-family residences; provided, however, that on the full utilization of all facilities constructed with the proceeds of the bonds authorized, the definition of "residential neighborhood" stated in the first sentence of this subdivision applies.
