    Sec. 27.025.  GENERAL PERMIT AUTHORIZING USE OF CLASS I INJECTION WELL TO INJECT NONHAZARDOUS BRINE FROM DESALINATION OPERATIONS OR NONHAZARDOUS DRINKING WATER TREATMENT RESIDUALS.  (a)  The commission may issue a general permit authorizing the use of a Class I injection well to inject nonhazardous brine from a desalination operation or to inject nonhazardous drinking water treatment residuals if the commission determines that the injection well and injection activities are more appropriately regulated under a general permit than under an individual permit based on findings that:
    
    (1)  the general permit has been drafted to ensure that it can be readily enforced and that the commission can adequately monitor compliance with the terms of the general permit; and
    
    (2)  the general permit will contain proper safeguards to protect ground and surface fresh water from pollution.
    
    (a-1)  A general permit issued under this section may authorize an injection well for the disposal of concentrate produced by the desalination of seawater.  The general permit must include any requirements necessary to maintain delegation of the federal underground injection control program administered by the commission.
    
    (b)  The commission shall publish notice of a proposed general permit in one or more newspapers of statewide or regional circulation and in the Texas Register.  The notice must include an invitation for written comments by the public to the commission regarding the proposed general permit and shall be published not later than the 30th day before the date the commission adopts the general permit.  The commission by rule may require additional notice to be given.
    
    (c)  The commission may hold a public meeting to provide an additional opportunity for public comment.  The commission shall give notice of the public meeting under this subsection by publication in the Texas Register not later than the 30th day before the date of the meeting.
    
    (d)  The commission shall issue a written response to comments on the general permit at the same time the commission issues or denies the permit.  The response to comments is available to the public and shall be mailed to each person who made a comment.
    
    (e)  A general permit may provide that an owner of a Class I injection well may obtain authorization to use the well to inject nonhazardous brine from a desalination operation or to inject nonhazardous drinking water treatment residuals under a general permit by submitting to the commission written notice of intent to be covered by the general permit.  The commission by rule shall establish the requirements for the notice of intent, including the information that an owner of an injection well subject to a general permit must submit to authorize the use of the well under the general permit.  A general permit may authorize the use of an injection well under the general permit on filing a complete and accurate notice of intent, including all information required by the commission's rules to be submitted, or it may specify a date or period of time after the commission receives the notice of intent, including the required information, on which the use of an injection well is authorized unless the executive director before that time notifies the owner that it is not eligible under the general permit.
    
    (f)  Authorization for the use of an injection well under a general permit does not confer a vested right.  After written notice to the owner of an injection well, the executive director may suspend authorization for the use of the well under a general permit and may require the owner to obtain authorization for the use of the well under an individual permit.
    
    (g)  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this chapter, the commission, after hearing, shall deny or suspend authorization for the use of an injection well under a general permit if the commission determines that the owner's compliance history is classified as unsatisfactory according to commission standards under Sections [5.753](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=5.753) and [5.754](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=5.754) and rules adopted and procedures developed under those sections.

    (h)  A general permit may be issued for a term not to exceed 10 years.  After notice and comment as provided by Subsections (b)-(d), a general permit may be amended, revoked, or canceled by the commission or renewed by the commission for an additional term or terms not to exceed 10 years each.  A general permit remains in effect until amended, revoked, or canceled by the commission or, unless renewed by the commission, until expired.  If before a general permit expires the commission proposes to renew that general permit, that general permit remains in effect until the date on which the commission takes final action on the proposed renewal.
    
    (i)  The commission may add or delete requirements for a general permit through a renewal or amendment process.  The commission shall provide a reasonable time to allow an owner of an injection well to make the changes necessary to comply with the additional requirements.
    
    (j)  The commission may impose a fee for the submission of a notice of intent to be covered by the general permit.  The fee must be in the same amount as a fee collected under Section [27.014](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=27.014).
    
    (k)  The issuance, amendment, renewal, suspension, revocation, or cancellation of a general permit or the authorization for the use of an injection well under a general permit is not subject to the requirements relating to a contested case hearing under Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code.

    (c)  On receiving the information required by Subsection (a) of this section, the railroad commission shall consider the information at the same time it considers whether or not to grant the permit, and if the applicant proposes to inject fresh water into the injection well for enhanced recovery, the railroad commission shall consider whether or not there is some other solid, liquid, or gaseous substance that is available to the applicant and that is economically and technically feasible for the applicant to use for enhanced recovery purposes.
    
    (d)  If the railroad commission finds that there is a solid, liquid, or gaseous substance other than fresh water available and economically and technically feasible for use in enhanced recovery under the permit, the railroad commission shall include as a condition of the permit, if granted, that the permittee use the other substance found to be available and economically and technically feasible and that the applicant not use fresh water or that the applicant use fresh water only to the extent specifically stated in the permit.
    
    (e)  This section does not apply to injection well permits that are in effect on September 1, 1983.  If fresh water is being injected into an injection well in an enhanced recovery program that is in effect on September 1, 1983, and after that time, another substance or material is used for injection for a period of time, the injection well permit is not canceled, and a new permit under this chapter is not required if the operator plans at a later date to resume the use of fresh water for injection in that enhanced recovery program.
    
    (f)  Injection well permits for wells that are used for enhanced recovery remain in force until canceled by the railroad commission.
    
    (g)  Except as provided by Subsection (h), a person may not continue utilizing or begin utilizing industrial or municipal waste as an injection fluid for enhanced recovery purposes without first obtaining a permit from the commission.
    
    (h)  The railroad commission may authorize a person to utilize nonhazardous brine from a desalination operation or nonhazardous drinking water treatment residuals as an injection fluid for enhanced recovery purposes without first obtaining a permit from the commission.  The use or disposal of radioactive material under this subsection is subject to the applicable requirements of Chapter [401](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=401), Health and Safety Code.

    Sec. 27.0513.  AREA PERMITS AND PRODUCTION AREAS FOR URANIUM MINING.  (a)  The commission may issue a permit pursuant to Section [27.011](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=27.011) that authorizes the construction and operation of two or more similar injection wells within a specified area for mining of uranium.  An application for a new permit issued pursuant to Section [27.011](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=27.011), a major amendment of such a permit, or a renewal of such a permit for mining of uranium is subject to the public notice requirements and opportunity for contested case hearing provided under Section [27.018](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=27.018).  A new, amended, or renewed permit must incorporate a table of pre-mining low and high values representing the range of groundwater quality within the permit boundary and area of review, as provided by commission rule, for each water quality parameter used to measure groundwater restoration in a commission-required restoration table.  The values in the permit range table must be established from pre-mining baseline wells and all available wells within the area of review, including those in the existing or proposed permit boundary and any existing or proposed production areas.  Wells used for that purpose are limited to those that have documented completion depths and screened intervals that correspond to a uranium production zone aquifer identified within the permit boundary.
    
    (b)  For a permit for mining of uranium issued on or after September 1, 2007, pursuant to Section [27.011](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=27.011), the term of the permit to authorize injection for recovery of uranium shall be 10 years.  The holder of a permit for mining of uranium issued by the commission before September 1, 2007, pursuant to Section [27.011](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=27.011), must submit an application to the commission before September 1, 2012, for renewal of the permit to authorize construction and operation of injection wells for mining of uranium.  Authority to construct or operate injection wells for recovery of uranium under a permit issued before September 1, 2007, pursuant to Section [27.011](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=27.011), expires on September 1, 2012, if an application for renewal of the permit is not submitted to the commission before September 1, 2012.  Expiration of authority under this subsection does not relieve the permit holder from obligations under the permit or applicable rules, including obligations to restore groundwater and to plug and abandon wells in accordance with the requirements of the permit and applicable rules.
    
    (c)  The commission may issue a holder of a permit issued pursuant to Section [27.011](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=27.011) for mining of uranium an authorization that allows the permit holder to conduct mining and restoration activities in production zones within the boundary established in the permit.  The commission by rule shall establish application requirements, technical requirements, including the methods for determining restoration table values, and procedural requirements for any authorization.  If a restoration table value for a proposed or amended authorization exceeds the range listed in the permit range table such that it falls above the upper limit of the range, the value within the permit range table must be used or a major amendment to the permit range table must be obtained, subject to an opportunity for a contested case hearing or the hearing requirements of Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code.

    (1)  the authorization is for a production zone located within the boundary of a permit that incorporates a range table of groundwater quality restoration values used to measure groundwater restoration by the commission;
    
    (2)  the application includes groundwater quality restoration values falling at or below the upper limit of the range established in Subdivision (1); and
    
    (3)  the authorization is for a production zone located within the boundary of a permit that incorporates groundwater baseline characteristics of the wells for the application required by commission rule.
    
    (e)  The range of restoration values in the range table used for Subsection (d) must be established from baseline wells and all available well sample data collected in the permit boundary and within one-quarter mile of the boundary of the production zone.
    
    (f)  As an alternative to Subsection (d), the first application for an authorization issued under Subsection (c) for a production zone located within the boundary of a permit issued under Subsection (a) is subject to the requirements of Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code, relating to an opportunity for a contested case hearing. The first authorization application must contain the following provisions:
    
    (1)  a baseline water quality table with a range of groundwater quality restoration values used to measure groundwater restoration by the commission that complies with the same range requirements as a permit described by Subsection (a);
    
    (2)  groundwater quality restoration values falling at or below the upper limit of the range established in Subdivision (1); and
    
    (3)  groundwater baseline characteristics of the wells for the application required by commission rule.
    
    (g)  If a first authorization has previously been issued for a production zone located within the boundary of a permit, that authorization is effective for the purposes of this subsection. A subsequent authorization application for a production zone that is located within the same permit boundary as a production zone for which an authorization was issued under Subsection (f) is not subject to an opportunity for a contested case hearing or the hearing requirements of Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code, unless the subsequent application would authorize the following:
    
    (1)  the use of groundwater from a well that was not previously approved in the permit for supplemental production water;
    
    (2)  expansion of the permit boundary; or
    
    (3)  application monitoring well locations that exceed well spacing requirements or reduce the number of wells required by commission rule.

    (5)  the injection of fresh water into a well that transects the Edwards Aquifer provided that:
    
    (A)  the well isolates the Edwards Aquifer and meets the construction and completion standards adopted by the commission under Section [27.154](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=27.154);
    
    (B)  the well is part of an engineered aquifer storage and recovery facility;
    
    (C)  the injected water:
    
    (i)  is sourced from a public water system, as defined by commission rule, that is permitted by the commission; and
    
    (ii)  meets water quality standards for public drinking water established by commission rule; and
    
    (D)  the injection complies with the provisions of Subchapter G that are not in conflict with this section.
    
    (g)  The commission must hold a public meeting before issuing a general permit under this section.
    
    (h)  Rules adopted or a permit issued under this section:
    
    (1)  must require that an injection well authorized by the rules or permit be monitored by means of:
    
    (A)  one or more monitoring wells operated by the injection well owner if the commission determines that there is an underground source of drinking water in the area of review that is potentially affected by the injection well; or
    
    (B)  if Paragraph (A) does not apply, one or more monitoring wells operated by a party other than the injection well owner, provided that all results of monitoring are promptly made available to the injection well owner;
    
    (2)  must ensure that an authorized activity will not result in the waste or pollution of fresh water;
    
    (3)  may not authorize an injection well under Subsection (f)(2), (3), or (5) unless the well is initially associated with a small-scale research project designed to evaluate the long-term feasibility and safety of:
    
    (A)  the injection of concentrate from a desalination facility; or
    
    (B)  an aquifer storage and recovery project;
    
    (4)  must require any authorization granted to be renewed at least as frequently as every 10 years;
    
    (5)  must require that an injection well authorized under Subsection (f)(2)(A) or (3)(A) be monitored on an ongoing basis by or in coordination with the well owner and that the well owner file monitoring reports with the commission at least as frequently as every three months;
    
    (6)  must ensure that any injection well authorized for the purpose of injecting concentrate from a desalination facility does not transect the fresh water portion of the Edwards Aquifer; and
    
    (7)  must ensure that an engineered aquifer storage and recovery facility project is consistent with the provisions of Subchapter G that are not in conflict with this section.
    
    (i)  A monitoring well described by Subsection (h)(1), if properly sited and completed, may also be used for monitoring a saline water production well.
    
    (j)  A project is considered to be a small-scale research project for purposes of Subsection (h)(3) if the project consists of one production well and one injection well that are operated on a limited scale to provide requisite scientific and engineering information.  Such a project is considered to be a small-scale research project regardless of the borehole size of the wells or the equipment associated with the wells or whether the wells are subsequently incorporated into a larger-scale commercial facility.
    
    (k)  Notwithstanding Subsection (h)(3), the commission by rule, individual permit, or general permit may authorize the owner of an injection well authorized under Subsection (f)(2), (3), or (5) to continue operating the well for the purpose of implementing the desalination or engineered aquifer storage and recovery project following completion of the small-scale research project, provided that:
    
    (1)  the injection well owner timely submits the information collected as part of the research project, including monitoring reports and information regarding the environmental impact of the well, to the commission;
    
    (2)  the injection well owner, following the completion of studies and monitoring adequate to characterize risks to the fresh water portion of the Edwards Aquifer, formations included in the Trinity Group, or other fresh water associated with the continued operation of the well, and at least 90 days before the date the owner initiates commercial well operations, files with the commission a notice of intent to continue operation of the well after completion of the research project; and
    
    (3)  the commission, based on the studies and monitoring and any other reasonably available information, determines that continued operation of the injection well as described in the notice of intent does not pose an unreasonable risk to the fresh water portion of the Edwards Aquifer, formations included in the Trinity Group, or other fresh water associated with the continued operation of the well.
    
    (l)  Repealed by Acts 2019, 86th Leg., R.S., Ch. 573 (S.B. [241](http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/86R/billtext/html/SB00241F.HTM)), Sec. 3.01(6), eff. September 1, 2019.
    
    (m)  The commission shall make the information provided by the owner of the injection well under Subsection (k)(1) easily accessible to the public in a timely manner.  The permit may authorize the owner of the well to continue operating the well following completion of the research project pending the determination by the commission.
    
    (n)  If the commission preliminarily determines that continued operation of the injection well would pose an unreasonable risk to the fresh water portion of the Edwards Aquifer, formations included in the Trinity Group, or other fresh water associated with the continued operation of the well, the commission shall notify the operator and specify, if possible, what well modifications or operational controls would be adequate to prevent that unreasonable risk.

    Sec. 27.153.  AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF CLASS V INJECTION WELLS.  (a) The commission may authorize the use of a Class V injection well as an ASR injection well:
    
    (1)  by rule;
    
    (2)  under an individual permit; or
    
    (3)  under a general permit.
    
    (b)  In adopting a rule or issuing a permit under this section, the commission shall consider:
    
    (1)  whether the injection of water will comply with the standards set forth under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. Section 300f et seq.);
    
    (2)  the extent to which the cumulative volume of water injected for storage in the receiving geologic formation can be successfully recovered from the geologic formation for beneficial use, taking into account that injected water may be commingled to some degree with native groundwater;
    
    (3)  the effect of the aquifer storage and recovery project on existing water wells; and
    
    (4)  whether the introduction of water into the receiving geologic formation will alter the physical, chemical, or biological quality of the native groundwater to a degree that would:
    
    (A)  render the groundwater produced from the receiving geologic formation harmful or detrimental to people, animals, vegetation, or property; or
    
    (B)  require an unreasonably higher level of treatment of the groundwater produced from the receiving geologic formation than is necessary for the native groundwater in order to render the groundwater suitable for beneficial use.
    
    (c)  All wells associated with a single aquifer storage and recovery project must be located within a continuous perimeter boundary of one parcel of land, or two or more adjacent parcels of land under common ownership, lease, joint operating agreement, or contract.

    (b)  This subsection applies only to an aquifer storage and recovery project proposed to be located in a groundwater conservation district or other special-purpose district with the authority to regulate the withdrawal of groundwater. Except as otherwise provided by this section, the commission shall limit the volume of water that may be recovered by an aquifer storage and recovery project to an amount that does not exceed the amount of water injected under the project. If the commission determines that the proposed injection of water into a geologic formation will result in a loss of injected water or native groundwater, the commission shall impose additional restrictions on the amount of water that may be recovered to account for the loss. The commission may not deny a permit based on a determination that a loss described by this subsection will occur. A limitation imposed under this subsection may not prohibit the production of native groundwater by an aquifer storage and recovery project if the production complies with Subchapter [N](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=36.451), Chapter [36](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=36).

    Sec. 27.203.  AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF CLASS V INJECTION WELLS.  (a) The commission may authorize the use of a Class V injection well as a recharge injection well:
    
    (1)  by rule;
    
    (2)  under an individual permit; or
    
    (3)  under a general permit.
    
    (b)  In adopting a rule or issuing a permit under this section, the commission shall consider:
    
    (1)  whether the injection of water will comply with the standards established by the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. Section 300f et seq.);
    
    (2)  the effect of the aquifer recharge project on existing water wells; and
    
    (3)  whether the introduction of water into the receiving geologic formation will alter the physical, chemical, or biological quality of the native groundwater to a degree that would:
    
    (A)  render the groundwater produced from the receiving geologic formation harmful or detrimental to people, animals, vegetation, or property; or
    
    (B)  require an unreasonably higher level of treatment of the groundwater produced from the receiving geologic formation than is necessary for the native groundwater to render the groundwater suitable for beneficial use.
    
    (c)  The commission by rule shall provide for public notice and comment on a proposed general permit authorized under this section. The commission shall require an applicant for an individual permit authorized under this section to provide notice of the application by first class mail to any groundwater conservation district in which the wells associated with the aquifer recharge project will be located and by publishing notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the wells will be located.
