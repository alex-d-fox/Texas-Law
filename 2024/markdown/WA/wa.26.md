    Sec. 26.0135.  WATERSHED MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT OF WATER QUALITY.  (a)  To ensure clean water, the commission shall establish the strategic and comprehensive monitoring of water quality and the periodic assessment of water quality in each watershed and river basin of the state.  In order to conserve public funds and avoid duplication of effort, subject to adequate funding under Section [26.0291](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=26.0291), river authorities shall, to the greatest extent possible and under the supervision of the commission, conduct water quality monitoring and assessments in their own watersheds.  Watershed monitoring and assessments involving agricultural or silvicultural nonpoint source pollution shall be coordinated through the State Soil and Water Conservation Board with local soil and water conservation districts.  The water quality monitoring and reporting duties under this section apply only to a river authority that has entered into an agreement with the commission to perform those duties.  The commission, either directly or through cooperative agreements and contracts with local governments, shall conduct monitoring and assessments of watersheds where a river authority is unable to perform an adequate assessment of its own watershed.  The monitoring program shall provide data to identify significant long-term water quality trends, characterize water quality conditions, support the permitting process, and classify unclassified waters.  The commission shall consider available monitoring data and assessment results in developing or reviewing wastewater permits and stream standards and in conducting other water quality management activities.  The assessment must include a review of wastewater discharges, nonpoint source pollution, nutrient loading, toxic materials, biological health of aquatic life, public education and involvement in water quality issues, local and regional pollution prevention efforts, and other factors that affect water quality within the watershed.  The monitoring and assessment required by this section is a continuing duty, and the monitoring and assessment shall be periodically revised to show changes in the factors subject to assessment.
    
    (b)  In order to assist in the coordination and development of assessments and reports required by this section, a river authority shall organize and lead a basin-wide steering committee that includes persons paying fees under Section [26.0291](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=26.0291), private citizens, the State Soil and Water Conservation Board, representatives from other appropriate state agencies, political subdivisions, and other persons with an interest in water quality matters of the watershed or river basin.  Based on committee and public input, each steering committee shall develop water quality objectives and priorities that are achievable considering the available technology and economic impact.  The objectives and priorities shall be used to develop work plans and allocate available resources under Section [26.0291](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=26.0291).  Each committee member shall help identify significant water quality issues within the basin and shall make available to the river authority all relevant water quality data held by the represented entities.  A river authority shall also develop a public input process that provides for meaningful comments and review by private citizens and organizations on each basin summary report.  A steering committee established by the commission to comply with this subsection in the absence of a river authority or other qualified local government is not subject to Chapter [2110](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2110), Government Code.
    
    (c)  The purpose of the monitoring and assessment required by this section is to identify significant issues affecting water quality within each watershed and river basin of the state.  Each river authority shall submit quality assured data collected in the river basin to the commission.  The commission shall use the data to develop the statewide water quality inventory and other assessment reports that satisfy federal reporting requirements.  The data and reports shall also be used to provide sufficient information for the commission, the State Soil and Water Conservation Board, river authorities, and other governmental bodies to take appropriate action necessary to maintain and improve the quality of the state's water resources.  The commission shall adopt rules that at a minimum require each river authority to:
    
    (1)  develop and maintain a basin-wide water quality monitoring program that minimizes duplicative monitoring, facilitates the assessment process, and targets monitoring to support the permitting and standards process;
    
    (2)  establish a watershed and river basin water quality database composed of quality assured data from river authorities, wastewater discharge permit holders, state and federal agencies, and other relevant sources and make the data available to any interested person;
    
    (3)  identify water quality problems and known pollution sources and set priorities for taking appropriate action regarding those problems and sources;
    
    (4)  develop a process for public participation that includes the basin steering committee and public review and input and that provides for meaningful review and comments by private citizens and organizations in the local watersheds;  and
    
    (5)  recommend water quality management strategies for correcting identified water quality problems and pollution sources.
    
    (d)  As required by commission rules, each river authority shall submit a written summary report to the commission, State Soil and Water Conservation Board, and Parks and Wildlife Department on the water quality assessment of the authority's watershed. The summary report must identify concerns relating to the watershed or bodies of water, including an identification of bodies of water with impaired or potentially impaired uses, the cause and possible source of use impairment, and recommended actions the commission may take to address those concerns. The summary report must discuss the public benefits from the water quality monitoring and assessment program, including efforts to increase public input in activities related to water quality and the effectiveness of targeted monitoring in assisting the permitting process. A river authority shall submit a summary report after the report has been approved by the basin steering committee and coordinated with the public and the commission. A river authority shall hold basin steering committee meetings and shall invite users of water and wastewater permit holders in the watershed who pay fees under Section [26.0291](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=26.0291) to review the draft of the work plans and summary report. A river authority shall inform those parties of the availability and location of the summary report for inspection and shall solicit input from those parties concerning their satisfaction with or suggestions for modification of the summary report for the watershed, the operation or effectiveness of the watershed monitoring and assessment program authorized by this section, and the adequacy, use, or equitable apportionment of the program's costs and funds. A river authority shall summarize all comments received from persons who pay fees under Section [26.0291](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=26.0291) and from steering committee members and shall submit the report and the summaries to the governor, the lieutenant governor, and the speaker of the house of representatives not later than the 90th day after the date the river authority submits the summary report to the commission and other agencies.
    
    (e)  Each local government within the watershed of a river authority shall cooperate in making the assessment under Subsection (a) of this section and in preparing the report by providing to the river authority all information available to the local government about water quality within the jurisdiction of the local government, including the extraterritorial jurisdiction of a municipality. 
    
    (f)  If more than one river authority is located in a watershed, all river authorities within the watershed shall cooperate in making the assessments and preparing the reports.
    
    (g)  For purposes of this section, solid waste and solid waste management shall have the same meaning as in Chapter [361](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=361), Health and Safety Code.  Each river authority and local government is authorized and encouraged, but not required, to manage solid waste and to facilitate and promote programs for the collection and disposal of household consumer and agricultural products which contain hazardous constituents or hazardous substances and which, when disposed of improperly, represent a threat of contamination to the water resources of the state.  Such programs may include the establishment of a permanent collection site, mobile collection sites, periodic collection events, or other methods which a river authority or local government may deem effective.
    
    (h)  The commission shall apportion, assess, and recover the reasonable costs of administering the water quality management programs under this section.  Irrigation water rights, non-priority hydroelectric rights of a water right holder that owns or operates privately owned facilities that collectively have a capacity of less than two megawatts, and water rights held in the Texas Water Trust for terms of at least 20 years will not be subject to this assessment.  The cost to river authorities and others to conduct water quality monitoring and assessment shall be subject to prior review and approval by the commission as to methods of allocation and total amount to be recovered.  The commission shall adopt rules to supervise and implement the water quality monitoring, assessment, and associated costs.  The rules shall ensure that water users and wastewater dischargers do not pay excessive amounts, that a river authority may recover no more than the actual costs of administering the water quality management programs called for in this section, and that no municipality shall be assessed cost for any efforts that duplicate water quality management activities described in Section [26.177](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=26.177). 
    
    (i)  In this section:
    
    (1)  "Quality assured data" means data that complies with commission rules for the water quality monitoring program adopted under Subsection (c)(1), including rules governing the methods under which water samples are collected and analyzed and data from those samples is assessed and maintained.
    
    (2)  "River authority" means:
    
    (A)  a river authority as defined by Section [30.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=30.003) of this code that includes 10 or more counties;  and
    
    (B)  any other river authority or special district created under Article III, Section 52, Subsection (b)(1) or (2), or Article XVI, Section [59](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=16.59), of the Texas Constitution that is designated by rule of the commission to comply with this section.

    Sec. 26.039.  ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES AND SPILLS.  (a)  As used in this section:
    
    (1)  "Accidental discharge" means an act or omission through which waste or other substances are inadvertently discharged into water in the state.
    
    (2)  "Spill" means an act or omission through which waste or other substances are deposited where, unless controlled or removed, they will drain, seep, run, or otherwise enter water in the state.
    
    (3)  "Other substances" means substances which may be useful or valuable and therefore are not ordinarily considered to be waste, but which will cause pollution if discharged into water in the state.
    
    (b)  Except as provided by Subsection (g), whenever an accidental discharge or spill occurs at or from any activity or facility which causes or may cause pollution, the individual operating, in charge of, or responsible for the activity or facility shall notify the commission as soon as possible and not later than 24 hours after the occurrence.  The individual's notice to the commission must include the location, volume, and content of the discharge or spill.
    
    (c)  Activities which are inherently or potentially capable of causing or resulting in the spillage or accidental discharge of waste or other substances and which pose serious or significant threats of pollution are subject to reasonable rules establishing safety and preventive measures which the commission may adopt or issue.  The safety and preventive measures which may be required shall be commensurate with the potential harm which could result from the escape of the waste or other substances.
    
    (d)  The provisions of this section are cumulative of the other provisions in this chapter relating to waste discharges, and nothing in this section exempts any person from complying with or being subject to any other provision of this chapter.
    
    (e)  Except as provided by Subsection (g), if an accidental discharge or spill described by Subsection (b) from a wastewater treatment or collection facility owned or operated by a local government may adversely affect a public or private source of drinking water, the individual shall also notify appropriate local government officials and local media.
    
    (f)  The commission by rule shall specify the conditions under which an individual must comply with Subsection (e) and prescribe procedures for giving the required notice.  The rules must also state the content of the notice and the manner of giving notice.  In formulating the rules, the commission shall consider:
    
    (1)  the nature and extent of the discharge or spill;
    
    (2)  the potential effect of the discharge or spill;  and
    
    (3)  regional information about the susceptibility of a particular drinking water source to a specific type of pollution.
    
    (g)  The individual is not required to notify the commission of an accidental discharge or spill of treated or untreated domestic wastewater under Subsection (b) or officials or media under Subsection (e) of a single accidental discharge or spill that:
    
    (1)  occurs at a wastewater treatment or collection facility owned or operated by a local government;
    
    (2)  has a volume of 1,000 gallons or less;
    
    (3)  is not associated with another simultaneous accidental discharge or spill;
    
    (4)  is controlled or removed before the accidental discharge or spill:
    
    (A)  enters water in the state; or
    
    (B)  adversely affects a public or private source of drinking water;
    
    (5)  will not endanger human health or safety or the environment; and
    
    (6)  is not otherwise subject to local regulatory control and reporting requirements.
    
    (h)  The commission by rule shall establish standard methods for calculating the volume of an accidental discharge or spill to be used for the purposes of this section.
    
    (i)  The individual shall calculate the volume of an accidental discharge or spill using an established standard method to determine whether the discharge or spill is exempted under Subsection (g) from the notification requirements of this section.
    
    (j)  The individual shall submit to the commission at least once each month a summary of accidental discharges and spills described by Subsection (g) that occurred during the preceding month.  The commission by rule shall:
    
    (1)  consider the compliance history of the individual; and
    
    (2)  establish procedures for formatting and submitting a summary, including requirements that a summary include the location, volume, and content of each accidental discharge or spill.

    Sec. 26.040.  GENERAL PERMITS.  (a)  The commission may issue a general permit to authorize the discharge of waste into or adjacent to waters in the state by category of dischargers in a particular geographical area of the state or in the entire state if the dischargers in the category discharge storm water or:
    
    (1)  engage in the same or substantially similar types of operations;
    
    (2)  discharge the same types of waste;
    
    (3)  are subject to the same requirements regarding effluent limitations or operating conditions;
    
    (4)  are subject to the same or similar monitoring requirements;  and
    
    (5)  are, in the commission's opinion, more appropriately regulated under a general permit than under individual permits based on commission findings that:
    
    (A)  the general permit has been drafted to assure that it can be readily enforced and that the commission can adequately monitor compliance with the terms of the general permit;  and
    
    (B)  the category of discharges covered by the general permit will not include a discharge of pollutants that will cause significant adverse effects to water quality.
    
    (b)  The commission shall publish notice of a proposed general permit in a daily or weekly newspaper of general circulation in the area affected by the activity that is the subject of the proposed general permit and in the Texas Register.  For a statewide general permit, the commission shall designate one or more newspapers of statewide or regional circulation and shall publish notice of the proposed statewide general permit in each designated newspaper in addition to the Texas Register.  The notice must include an invitation for written comments by the public to the commission regarding the proposed general permit and shall be published not later than the 30th day before the commission adopts the general permit.  The commission by rule may require additional notice to be given.
    
    (c)  The commission may hold a public meeting to provide an additional opportunity for public comment.  The commission shall give notice of a public meeting under this subsection by publication in the Texas Register not later than the 30th day before the date of the meeting.
    
    (d)  If the commission receives public comment relating to issuance of a general permit, the commission may issue the general permit only after responding in writing to the comments.  The commission shall issue a written response to comments on the permit at the same time the commission issues or denies the permit.  The response is available to the public and shall be mailed to each person who made a comment.
    
    (e)  A general permit may provide that a discharger who is not covered by an individual permit may obtain authorization to discharge waste under a general permit by submitting to the commission written notice of intent to be covered by the general permit.  A general permit shall specify the deadline for submitting and the information required to be included in a notice of intent.  A general permit may authorize a discharger to begin discharging under the general permit immediately on filing a complete and accurate notice of intent, or it may specify a date or period of time after the commission receives the discharger's notice of intent on which the discharger may begin discharging unless the executive director before that time notifies the discharger that it is not eligible for authorization under the general permit.
    
    (f)  A general permit may authorize a discharger to discharge without submitting a notice of intent if the commission finds that a notice of intent requirement would be inappropriate.
    
    (g)  Authorization to discharge under a general permit does not confer a vested right.  After written notice to the discharger, the executive director may suspend a discharger's authority to discharge under a general permit and may require a person discharging under a general permit to obtain authorization to discharge under an individual permit as required by Section [26.027](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=26.027) or other law.
    
    (h)  Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter, the commission, after hearing, shall deny or suspend a discharger's authority to discharge under a general permit if the commission determines that the discharger's compliance history is classified as unsatisfactory according to commission standards under Sections [5.753](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=5.753) and [5.754](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=5.754) and rules adopted and procedures developed under those sections. A hearing under this subsection is not subject to Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code.
    
    (i)  A general permit may be issued for a term not to exceed five years.  After notice and comment as provided by Subsections (b)-(d), a general permit may be amended, revoked, or canceled by the commission or renewed by the commission for an additional term or terms not to exceed five years each.  A general permit remains in effect until amended, revoked, or canceled by the commission or, unless renewed by the commission, until expired.  If before a general permit expires the commission proposes to renew that general permit, that general permit remains in effect until the date on which the commission takes final action on the proposed renewal.
    
    (j)  The commission may through a renewal or amendment process for a general permit add or delete requirements or limitations to the permit.  The commission shall provide a reasonable time to allow a discharger covered by the general permit to make the changes necessary to comply with the additional requirements.
    
    (k)  The commission may impose a reasonable and necessary fee under Section [26.0291](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=26.0291) on a discharger covered by a general permit.
    
    (l)  The issuance, amendment, renewal, suspension, revocation, or cancellation of a general permit or of authority to discharge under a general permit is not subject to Subchapters C-F, Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code.

    Sec. 26.049.  SANITARY SEWER OVERFLOWS.  (a)  The commission may not adopt a rule governing sanitary sewer overflows, issue a permit regarding sanitary sewer overflows, or initiate any enforcement action related to a sanitary sewer overflow or a threatened overflow that:
    
    (1)  is stricter than the national policy for sewer overflows;  or
    
    (2)  seeks compliance in a manner that exceeds the minimum requirements of that policy.
    
    (b)  If the commission adopts a rule governing sanitary sewer overflows, the commission shall:
    
    (1)  employ the maximum flexibility allowed under the national policy for sewer overflows;
    
    (2)  allow alternative strategies for the control of sanitary sewer overflows;
    
    (3)  consider the financial conditions and constraints of local governments that own separate sanitary sewer systems;  and
    
    (4)  allow local governments that own separate sanitary sewer systems sufficient time to design and develop cost-effective methods for controlling sanitary sewer overflows before the commission begins an enforcement action to control sanitary sewer overflows.
    
    (c)  Until a national policy for separate sanitary sewer system overflows is finally adopted and if the commission adopts a rule governing sewer overflows, the commission may use the national combined sewer overflow policy as the basis for working with local governments to develop cost-effective programs to control sewer overflows.  Implementation schedules developed may be based on the national combined sewer overflow policy.
    
    (d)  The commission may require a local government that substantially complies with the national policy for sewer overflows to provide additional controls only if the commission documents a water quality problem attributable to the local government that threatens human health, safety, or the environment.

    (3)  "Separate sanitary sewer system" means a wastewater collection system, separate and distinct from a storm sewer system, that conveys domestic, municipal, commercial, or industrial wastewaters to a publicly owned treatment plant.
    
    (4)  "Sanitary sewer overflow" means a discharge of wastewater, stormwater that has entered a separate sanitary sewer system, or a combination of wastewater and stormwater from a separate sanitary sewer system at a point or points before the water enters a publicly owned treatment plant.
    
    (f)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the commission shall establish criteria for evaluating whether to initiate an enforcement action related to sanitary sewer overflows that occur as the result of a blockage due to grease.  The criteria shall include consideration of whether the discharge:
    
    (1)  could reasonably have been prevented;
    
    (2)  was minimized;  and

    (c)  A local government may apply to the commission for an exception from the requirements of Subsections (a) and (b) of this section or for a modification of those requirements.  The application shall contain the exception or modifications desired, the reasons the exception or modifications are needed, and the grounds authorized in this subsection on which the commission should grant the application.  A public hearing on the application shall be held in or near the territorial area of the local government, and notice of the hearing shall be given to the local government.  If after the hearing the commission in its judgment determines that the volume, type, character, and quality of the waste of the users of the system or of a particular user or class of users of the system do not warrant the enactment and enforcement of rules containing the requirements prescribed in Subsections (a) and (b) of this section or that the enactment and enforcement of the rules would be impractical or unreasonably burdensome on the local government in relation to the public benefit to be derived, then the commission in its discretion may enter an order granting an exception to those requirements or modifying those requirements in any particular in response to circumstances shown to exist.
    
    (d)  At any time and from time to time as circumstances may require, the commission may amend or revoke any order it enters pursuant to Subsection (c) of this section.  Before the commission amends or revokes such an order, a public hearing shall be held in or near the territorial area of the local government in question, and notice of the hearing shall be given to the local government.  If after the hearing the commission in its judgment determines that the circumstances on which it based the order have changed significantly or no longer exist, the commission may revoke the order or amend it in any particular in response to the circumstances then shown to exist.
    
    (e)  In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this section and any other laws or parts of laws, the provisions of this section shall control.

    Sec. 26.177.  WATER POLLUTION CONTROL DUTIES OF CITIES.  (a)  A city may establish a water pollution control and abatement program for the city.  If the watershed water quality assessment reports required by Section [26.0135](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=26.0135) or other commission assessments or studies identify water pollution that is attributable to non-permitted sources in a city that has a population of 10,000 or more, the commission, after providing the city a reasonable time to correct the problem and after holding a public hearing, may require the city to establish a water pollution control and abatement program.  The city shall employ or retain an adequate number of personnel on either a part-time or full-time basis as the needs and circumstances of the city may require, who by virtue of their training or experience are qualified to perform the water pollution control and abatement functions required to enable the city to carry out its duties and responsibilities under this section.
    
    (b)  The water pollution control and abatement program of a city shall encompass the entire city and, subject to Section [26.179](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=26.179) of this code, may include areas within its extraterritorial jurisdiction which in the judgment of the city should be included to enable the city to achieve the objectives of the city for the area within its territorial jurisdiction.  The city shall include in the program the services and functions which, in the judgment of the city or as may be reasonably required by the commission, will provide effective water pollution control and abatement for the city, including the following services and functions:
    
    (1)  the development and maintenance of an inventory of all significant waste discharges into or adjacent to the water within the city and, where the city so elects, within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city, without regard to whether or not the discharges are authorized by the commission;
    
    (2)  the regular monitoring of all significant waste discharges included in the inventory prepared pursuant to Subdivision (1) of this subsection;
    
    (3)  the collecting of samples and the conducting of periodic inspections and tests of the waste discharges being monitored to determine whether the discharges are being conducted in compliance with this chapter and any applicable permits, orders, or rules of the commission, and whether they should be covered by a permit from the commission;
    
    (4)  in cooperation with the commission, a procedure for obtaining compliance by the waste dischargers being monitored, including where necessary the use of legal enforcement proceedings;
    
    (5)  the development and execution of reasonable and realistic plans for controlling and abating pollution or potential pollution resulting from generalized discharges of waste which are not traceable to a specific source, such as storm sewer discharges and urban runoff from rainwater;  and
    
    (6)  any additional services, functions, or other requirements as may be prescribed by commission rule.
    
    (c)  The water pollution control and abatement program required by Subsections (a) and (b) of this section must be submitted to the commission for review and approval.  The commission may adopt rules providing the criteria for the establishment of those programs and the review and approval of those programs.
    
    (d)  Any person affected by any ruling, order, decision, ordinance, program, resolution, or other act of a city relating to water pollution control and abatement outside the corporate limits of such city adopted pursuant to this section or any other statutory authorization may appeal such action to the commission or district court.  An appeal must be filed with the commission within 60 days of the enactment of the ruling, order, decision, ordinance, program, resolution, or act of the city.  The issue on appeal is whether the action or program is invalid, arbitrary, unreasonable, inefficient, or ineffective in its attempt to control water quality.  The commission or district court may overturn or modify the action of the city.  If an appeal is taken from a commission ruling, the commission ruling shall be in effect for all purposes until final disposition is made by a court of competent jurisdiction so as not to delay any permit approvals.
    
    (e)  The commission may adopt and assess reasonable and necessary fees adequate to recover the costs of the commission in administering this section.
    
    (f)  A city may contract with a river authority or another political subdivision to perform any or all services and functions that are part of a water pollution control and abatement program established under this section.
    
    (g)  The commission may assist cities in identifying and obtaining funds and technical assistance that may be available to assist a city, or a river authority or other political subdivision with whom a city has contracted, in performing any or all of the services or functions that are part of a water pollution control and abatement program established under this section.
    
    (h)  Property subject to a permit or plat in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of a municipality may not be subjected to new or additional water pollution regulations if the property is transferred to another municipality's extraterritorial jurisdiction, and all provisions of Chapter [245](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=245), Local Government Code, shall apply to the property.  If the release of extraterritorial jurisdiction for the purpose of transferring it to another municipality results in property not being subject to any municipality's water pollution regulations on the date of release, the releasing municipality retains its jurisdiction to enforce its water pollution regulations until the property is included in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the receiving municipality.

    Sec. 26.179.  DESIGNATION OF WATER QUALITY PROTECTION ZONES IN CERTAIN AREAS.  (a)  In this section, "water quality protection" may be achieved by:
    
    (1)  maintaining background levels of water quality in waterways;  or
    
    (2)  capturing and retaining the first 1.5 inches of rainfall from developed areas.
    
    (b)  For the purpose of Subsection (a)(1), "maintaining background levels of water quality in waterways" means maintaining background levels of water quality in waterways comparable to those levels which existed prior to new development as measured by the following constituents:  total suspended solids, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and chemical and biochemical oxygen demand.  Background levels shall be established either from sufficient data collected from water quality monitoring at one or more sites located within the area designated as a water quality protection zone or, if such data are unavailable, from calculations performed and certified by a registered professional engineer utilizing the concepts and data from the National Urban Runoff Program (NURP) Study or other studies approved by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (commission) for the constituents resulting from average annual runoff, until such data collected at the site are available.  Background levels for undeveloped sites shall be verified based on monitoring results from other areas of property within the zone prior to its development.  The monitoring shall consist of a minimum of one stage (flow) composite sample for at least four storm events of one-half inch or more of rainfall that occur at least one month apart.  Monitoring of the four constituents shall be determined by monitoring at four or more locations where runoff occurs.  A minimum of four sample events per year for each location for rainfall events greater than one-half inch shall be taken.  Monitoring shall occur for three consecutive years after each phase of development occurs within the Water Quality Protection Zone.  Each new phase of development, including associated best management practices, will require monitoring for a three-year period.  The results of the monitoring and a description of the best management practices being used throughout the zone shall be summarized in a technical report and submitted to the commission no later than April 1 of each calendar year during development of the property, although the commission may determine that monitoring is no longer required.  The commission shall review the technical report.  If the performance monitoring and best management practices indicate that background levels were not maintained during the previous year, the owner or developer of land within the water quality protection zone shall:
    
    (1)  modify water quality plans developed under this section for future phases of development in the water quality protection zone to the extent reasonably feasible and practical;  and
    
    (2)  modify operational and maintenance practices in existing phases of the water quality protection zone to the extent reasonably feasible and practical.
    
    Water quality monitoring shall not be required in areas using the methodology described by Subsection (a)(2).
    
    (c)  This section applies only to those areas within the extraterritorial jurisdiction, outside the full-purpose corporate limits of a municipality with a population greater than 10,000, and in which the municipality either:
    
    (1)  has enacted or attempted to enforce three or more ordinances or amendments thereto attempting to regulate water quality or control or abate water pollution in the area within the five years preceding the effective date of this Act, whether or not such ordinances or amendments were legally effective upon the area;  or
    
    (2)  enacts or attempts to enforce three or more ordinances or amendments thereto attempting to regulate water quality or control or abate water pollution in the area in any five-year period, whether or not such ordinances or amendments are legally effective upon the area.
    
    (d)  The owner or owners of a contiguous tract of land in excess of 1,000 acres that is located within an area subject to this section may designate the tract as a "water quality protection zone."  Upon prior approval of the Commission, the owner of a contiguous tract of land containing less than 1,000 acres, but not less than 500 acres, that is located within an area subject to this section may also designate the tract as a "water quality protection zone."  The tract shall be deemed contiguous if all of its parts are physically adjacent, without regard to easements, rights-of-way, roads, streambeds, and public or quasi-public land, or it is part of an integrated development under common ownership or control.  The purpose of a water quality protection zone is to provide for the consistent protection of water quality in the zone without imposing undue regulatory uncertainty on owners of land in the zone.
    
    (e)  A water quality protection zone designated under this section shall be described by metes and bounds or other adequate legal description.  The designation shall include a general description of the proposed land uses within the zone, a water quality plan for the zone, and a general description of the water quality facilities and infrastructure to be constructed for water quality protection in the zone.
    
    (f)  Creation of a water quality protection zone shall become immediately effective upon recordation of the designation in the deed records of the county in which the land is located.  The designation shall be signed by the owner or owners of the land, and notice of such filing shall be given to the city clerk of the municipality within whose extraterritorial jurisdiction the zone is located and the clerk of the county in which the property is located.
    
    (g)  A water quality protection zone designation may be amended and a designation may specify the party or parties authorized to execute amendments to the zone designation and the zone's water quality plan.  Land may be added to or excluded from a zone by amending the zone designation.  An amendment to a zone designation adding land to or excluding land from a zone must describe the boundaries of the zone as enlarged or reduced by metes and bounds or other adequate legal description.  An amendment to a zone designation is effective on its filing in the deed records of the county in which the land is located.  On application by all owners of land in a zone, or by each party authorized by the zone designation or an amendment to the zone designation to amend the zone designation, the commission may terminate a zone on reasonable terms and conditions specified by the commission.
    
    (h)  The water quality plan for a zone, including the determination of background levels of water quality, shall be signed and sealed by a registered professional engineer acknowledging that the plan is designed to achieve the water quality protection standard defined in this section.  On recordation in the deed records, the water quality plan shall be submitted to and accepted by the commission for approval, and the commission shall accept and approve the plan unless the commission finds that implementation of the plan will not reasonably attain the water quality protection as defined in this section.  A water quality plan may be amended from time to time on filing with the commission, and all such amendments shall be accepted by the commission unless there is a finding that the amendment will impair the attainment of water quality protection as defined in this section.  The commission shall adopt and assess reasonable and necessary fees adequate to recover the costs of the commission in administering this section.  The commission's review and approval of a water quality plan shall be performed by the commission staff that is responsible for reviewing pollution abatement plans in the county where the zone is located.  The review and approval of the plan or any amendment to the plan shall be completed within 120 days of the date it is filed with the commission.  A public hearing on the plan shall not be required, and acceptance, review, and approval of the water quality plan or water quality protection zone shall not be delayed pending the adoption of rules.  The commission shall have the burden of proof for the denial of a plan or amendments to a plan, and any such denial shall be appealable to a court of competent jurisdiction.  The water quality plan, or any amendment thereto, shall be effective upon recordation of the plan or the amendment in the deed records and shall apply during the period of review and approval by the commission or appeal of the denial of the plan or any amendment.  New development under a plan may not proceed until the plan or amendment to the plan, as appropriate, has been approved by the commission.
    
    (i)  The water quality plan for a zone shall be a covenant running with the land.
    
    (j)  A municipality may not enforce in a zone any of its ordinances, land use ordinances, rules, or requirements including, but not limited to, the abatement of nuisances, pollution control and abatement programs or regulations, water quality ordinances, subdivision requirements, other than technical review and inspections for utilities connecting to a municipally owned water or wastewater system, or any environmental regulations which are inconsistent with the land use plan and the water quality plan or which in any way limit, modify, or impair the ability to implement and operate the water quality plan and the land use plan within the zone as filed;  nor shall a municipality collect fees or assessments or exercise powers of eminent domain within a zone until the zone has been annexed for the municipality.  A water quality protection zone may be annexed by a municipality only after the installation and completion of 90 percent of all facilities and infrastructure described in the water quality plan for the entire zone as being necessary to carry out such plan or the expiration of 20 years from the date of designation of the zone, whichever occurs first.
    
    (k)  Subdivision plats within a water quality protection zone shall be approved by the municipality in whose extraterritorial jurisdiction the zone is located and the commissioners court of the county in which the zone is located if:
    
    (1)  the plat complies with the subdivision design regulations of the county;  and
    
    (2)  the plat is acknowledged by a registered professional engineer stating that the plat is in compliance with the water quality plan within the water quality protection zone.
    
    (l)  A water quality protection zone implementing a water quality plan which meets the requirements of this section shall be presumed to satisfy all other state and local requirements for the protection of water quality;  provided, however, that:
    
    (1)  development in the zone shall comply with all state laws and commission rules regulating water quality which are in effect on the date the zoning is designated;  and
    
    (2)  nothing in this section shall supersede or interfere with the applicability of water quality measures or regulations adopted by a conservation and reclamation district comprising more than two counties and which apply to the watershed area of a surface lake or surface reservoir that impounds at least 4,000 acre-feet of water.
    
    (m)(1) One or more of the provisions of this section may be waived by the owner or owners of property that is or becomes subject to an agreement entered into after the effective date of this Act between the owner or owners of land within the zone and the municipality.  The agreement shall be in writing, and the parties may agree:
    
    (A)  to guarantee continuation of the extraterritorial status of the zone and its immunity from annexation by the municipality for a period not to exceed 15 years after the effective date of the agreement;
    
    (B)  to authorize certain land uses and development within the zone;
    
    (C)  to authorize enforcement by the municipality of certain municipal land use and development regulations within the zone, in the same manner such regulations are enforced within the municipality's boundaries, as may be agreed by the landowner and the municipality;
    
    (D)  to vary any watershed protection regulations;
    
    (E)  to authorize or restrict the creation of political subdivisions within the zone;  and
    
    (F)  to such other terms and considerations the parties consider appropriate, including, but not limited to, the continuation of land uses and zoning after annexation of the zone, the provision of water and wastewater service to the property within the zone, and the waiver or conditional waiver of provisions of this section.
    
    (2)  An agreement under this section shall meet the requirements of and have the same force and effect as an agreement entered into pursuant to Section [42.046](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=42.046), Local Government Code.
    
    (n)  In addition to the requirements of Subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2), the commission may require and enforce additional water quality protection measures to comply with mandatory federal water quality requirements, standards, permit provisions, or regulations.
    
    (o)  This section does not apply to an area within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of a municipality with a population greater than 1.3 million that has extended to the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the municipality an ordinance whose purpose is to prevent the pollution of an aquifer which is the sole or principal drinking water source for the municipality.
    
    (p)  If a municipality's action results in part of a zone being located outside the municipality's extraterritorial jurisdiction, the entire zone is removed from the municipality's extraterritorial jurisdiction.  A zone removed from a municipality's extraterritorial jurisdiction may not be brought into the municipality's extraterritorial jurisdiction before the 20th anniversary of the date on which the zone was designated.
    
    (q)  In addition to the fees authorized under Subsection (h), the commission shall adopt and assess reasonable and necessary fees adequate to recover the commission's costs in monitoring water quality associated with water quality protection zones.

    (b)  The account shall consist of money appropriated to it by the legislature and any fines, civil penalties, or other reimbursement to the account provided for under this subchapter.
    
    (c)  The commission may expend money in the account only for the purposes of:

    (2)  obtaining personnel, equipment, and supplies required in the cleanup of discharges and spills;  and
    
    (3)  the assessment of damages to and the restoration of land and aquatic resources held in trust or owned by the state.
    
    (d)  In addition to any cause of action under Chapter [40](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=40), Natural Resources Code, the state has a cause of action against any responsible person for recovery of:
    
    (1)  expenditures out of the account;  and
    
    (2)  costs that would have been incurred or paid by the responsible person if the responsible person had fully carried out the duties under Section [26.266](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=26.266) of this code, including:
    
    (A)  reasonable costs of reasonable and necessary scientific studies to determine impacts of the spill on the environment and natural resources and to determine the manner in which to respond to spill impacts;
    
    (B)  costs of attorney services;
    
    (C)  out-of-pocket costs associated with state agency action;
    
    (D)  reasonable costs incurred by the state in cleanup operations, including costs of personnel, equipment, and supplies and restoration of land and aquatic resources held in trust or owned by the state;  and

    (e)  The state's right to recover under Subsection (d) of this section arises whether or not expenditures have actually been made out of the account.
    
    (f)  It is the intent of the legislature that the state attempt to recover the costs of cleanup according to the following priority:
    
    (1)  a responsible person;  and
    
    (2)  the federal government to the extent that recovery from a responsible person is insufficient to pay the costs of cleanup.
    
    (g)  In a suit brought under Subsection (d) of this section, any responsible person who, after reasonable notice has been given by the executive director, has failed, after a reasonable period, to carry out his duties under Section [26.266](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=26.266) of this code is liable to the state for twice the costs incurred by the state under this subchapter in cleaning up the spill or discharge.  Reasonable notice under this subsection must include a statement as to the basis for finding the person to whom notice is sent to be a responsible person.  Any responsible person held liable under this subsection or Subsection (d) of this section has the right to recover indemnity or contribution from any third party who caused, suffered, allowed, or permitted the spill or discharge.  Liability arising under this subsection or Subsection (d) of this section does not affect any rights the responsible person has against a third party whose acts caused or contributed to the spill or discharge.

    (i)  A settlement agreement does not discharge the liability of a nonsettling person to the state unless the agreement provides otherwise.
    
    (j)  Notwithstanding Subsection (i), a settlement agreement reduces the potential liability to the state of the nonsettling persons by the amount of the settlement.

    (d)  The commission may retain agents to take corrective action it considers necessary under this section.  The agents shall operate under the direction of the executive director.  Any expenses arising from corrective action taken by the commission or the executive director may be paid from the waste management account.
    
    (e)  The commission has the primary regulatory authority to direct the remediation of a release from an underground or aboveground storage tank that contains petroleum if the release does not present an immediate or imminent threat of fire or explosion.
    
    (f)  The person performing corrective action under this section, if the release was reported to the commission on or before December 22, 1998, shall meet the following deadlines:
    
    (1)  a complete site assessment and risk assessment (including, but not limited to, risk-based criteria for establishing target concentrations), as determined by the executive director, must be received by the agency no later than September 1, 2002;
    
    (2)  a complete corrective action plan, as determined by the executive director and including, but not limited to, completion of pilot studies and recommendation of a cost-effective and technically appropriate remediation methodology, must be received by the agency no later than September 1, 2003.  The person may, in lieu of this requirement, submit by this same deadline a demonstration that a corrective action plan is not required for the site in question under commission rules.  Such demonstration must be to the executive director's satisfaction;
    
    (3)  for those sites found under Subdivision (2) to require a corrective action plan, that plan must be initiated and proceeding according to the requirements and deadlines in the approved plan no later than March 1, 2004;
    
    (4)  for sites which require either a corrective action plan or groundwater monitoring, a comprehensive and accurate annual status report concerning those activities must be submitted to the agency;
    
    (5)  for sites which require either a corrective action plan or groundwater monitoring, all deadlines set by the executive director concerning the corrective action plan or approved groundwater monitoring plan shall be met; and
    
    (6)  for sites that require either a corrective action plan or groundwater monitoring, have met all other deadlines under this subsection, and have submitted annual progress reports that demonstrate progress toward meeting closure requirements, a site closure request must be submitted to the executive director no later than September 1, 2011.  The request must be complete, as judged by the executive director.
    
    (g)  For persons regulated under Subsection (f), their failure to comply with any deadline listed in Subsection (f) is a violation of this section and the executive director may enforce such a violation under Chapter [7](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=7) of this code.  A missed deadline that is the fault of the person, his agent, or contractor shall also eliminate reimbursement eligibility as described at Section [26.3571](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=26.3571)(b).  If it can be established to the executive director's satisfaction that the deadline was not missed at the fault of the person, his agent, or contractor, then reimbursement eligibility is not affected under this subsection.
    
    (h)  A person's liability to perform corrective action under this chapter is unrelated to any possible reimbursements the person may be eligible for under Section [26.3571](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=26.3571).
    
    (i)  The commission shall by rule define "risk-based corrective action" for purposes of this section.

    Sec. 26.3513.  LIABILITY AND COSTS:  MULTIPLE OWNERS AND OPERATORS.  (a)  This section applies at a site where the owner and the operator are different persons or at a site where there is more than one underground storage tank, petroleum storage tank, or a combination of both.
    
    (b)  Each owner and operator of an underground storage tank or petroleum storage tank at a site to which this section applies and from which a release or threatened release occurs is responsible for taking all corrective action at the site which may be required under this subchapter;  provided that liability for the expenses of corrective action among owners and operators may be apportioned as provided by this section.
    
    (c)  All owners and operators of underground storage tanks and petroleum storage tanks at a site to which this section applies shall attempt to negotiate a settlement among themselves as to the apportionment of expenses.
    
    (d)  If the owners and operators reach a settlement as to the apportionment of expenses on or before the 30th day from the date on which the commission issues an order requiring corrective action, they shall submit the settlement to the commission for review.  If the commission approves the settlement, the parties shall be liable for the expenses of taking corrective action in accordance with the approved settlement.  Any action for breach of contract on the settlement agreement shall be to the district court of Travis County.
    
    (e)  If the parties cannot reach a settlement by the 30th day after the commission issues its order, the commission shall file suit in the district court of Travis County.  In its petition, the commission:
    
    (1)  shall request the court to apportion the expenses of corrective action among the owners and operators;  and
    
    (2)  may request the court to award recovery of costs as provided by Section [26.355](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=26.355) of this code.  In the alternative, the commission may file an action for recovery of costs at a later time.
    
    (f)  Where the owner or operator can prove by a preponderance of the evidence that liability for the expenses of taking corrective action in response to a release or threatened release is divisible, that person shall be liable for the expenses only to the extent that the impact to the groundwater, surface water, or subsurface soils is attributable to the release or threatened release from his underground storage tank or petroleum storage tank.
    
    (g)  The court may allocate corrective action costs among liable parties, using such equitable factors as the court determines are appropriate if the evidence is insufficient to establish each party's divisible portion of the liability for corrective action under Subsection (f) of this section and joint and several liability would impose undue hardship on the owners and operators.
    
    (h)  If the court apportions liability for the expenses of corrective action as provided by Subsection (f) or (g) of this section, cost recovery against the owners and operators shall be based on the apportionment.
    
    (i)  The commission may use the petroleum storage tank remediation account to take corrective action at any time before, during, or after the conclusion of apportionment proceedings commenced under this section.
    
    (j)  Any owner or operator of a petroleum storage tank at the site may voluntarily undertake such corrective action at the site as the commission may agree to or require.  An owner or operator who undertakes corrective action pursuant to this subsection may have contribution against all other owners and operators with tanks at the site.
    
    (k)  Nothing in this section:
    
    (1)  prohibits the commission from using the waste management account to take corrective action as provided by this subchapter and having cost recovery for the waste management account;  or
    
    (2)  affects the assessment of administrative penalties by the commission for violations of this subchapter or rules or orders adopted thereunder.
    
    (l)  At the request of the commission, the attorney general shall file suit on behalf of the commission to seek the relief provided by this section.
    
    (m)  The commission shall consider the person who is in day-to-day control of a petroleum storage tank system at a site that is in violation of this subchapter to be the:
    
    (1)  person primarily responsible for taking corrective action, for corrective action costs, for receiving a notice of violation, or for paying a penalty assessed;  and
    
    (2)  primary subject of an enforcement action or order under this subchapter.

    Sec. 26.3514.  LIMITS ON LIABILITY OF LENDER.  (a)  This section applies:
    
    (1)  to a lender that has a security or lienhold interest in an underground or aboveground storage tank, in real property on which an underground or aboveground storage tank is located, or in any other personal property attached to or located on property on which an underground or aboveground storage tank is located, as security for a loan to finance the acquisition or development of the property, to finance the removal, repair, replacement, or upgrading of the tank, or to finance the performance of corrective action in response to a release of a regulated substance from the tank;  or
    
    (2)  to situations in which the real or personal property constitutes collateral for a commercial loan.
    
    (b)  A lender is not liable as an owner or operator under this subchapter solely because the lender holds indicia of ownership to protect a security or lienhold interest in property as described by Subsection (a) of this section.
    
    (c)  A lender that exercises control over a property before foreclosure to preserve the collateral or to retain revenues from the property for the payment of debt, or that otherwise exercises the control of a mortgagee in possession, is not liable as an owner or operator under this subchapter unless that control leads to action that the commission finds is causing or exacerbating contamination associated with the release of a regulated substance from a tank located on the property.
    
    (d)  A lender that has a bona fide security or lienhold interest in any real or personal property as described by Subsection (a) of this section and that forecloses on or receives an assignment or deed in lieu of foreclosure and becomes the owner of that real or personal property is not liable as an owner or operator under this subchapter if the lender removes from service any underground or aboveground storage tanks on the property in accordance with commission rules and takes and with due diligence completes corrective action in response to any release from those tanks in accordance with commission rules.  A lender shall begin removal or corrective action as prescribed by the commission within a reasonable time, as set by the commission, after the date on which the lender becomes the owner of the property, but not to exceed 90 days after that date.
    
    (e)  If a lender removes a tank from service or takes corrective action at any time before or after foreclosure, the lender shall perform corrective action in accordance with requirements adopted by the commission under this subchapter.
    
    (f)  A lender described by Subsection (a) is not liable as an owner or operator under this subchapter because the lender sells, re-leases, liquidates, or winds up operations and takes measures to preserve, protect, or prepare the secured aboveground or underground storage tank before sale or other disposition of the storage tank or the property if the lender:
    
    (1)  did not participate in the management of an aboveground or underground storage tank or real or personal property described by Subsection (a) before foreclosure or its equivalent on the storage tank or the property;  and
    
    (2)  establishes, as provided by Subsection (g), that the ownership indicia maintained after foreclosure continue to be held primarily to protect a security interest.
    
    (g)  A lender may establish that the ownership indicia maintained after foreclosure continue to be held primarily to protect a security interest if, within 12 months after foreclosure, the lender:
    
    (1)  lists the aboveground or underground storage tank, or the facility or property on which the tank is located, with a broker, dealer, or agent who deals in that type of property;  or
    
    (2)  advertises the aboveground or underground storage tank for sale or other disposition, at least monthly, in:
    
    (A)  a real estate publication;
    
    (B)  a trade or other publication appropriate for the aboveground or underground storage tank being advertised;  or
    
    (C)  a newspaper of general circulation in the area in which the aboveground or underground storage tank is located.
    
    (h)  For purposes of Subsection (g), the 12-month period begins:
    
    (1)  when the lender acquires marketable title, if the lender, after the expiration of any redemption period or other waiting period required by law, was acting diligently to acquire marketable title;  or
    
    (2)  on the date of foreclosure or its equivalent, if the lender does not act diligently to acquire marketable title.
    
    (i)  If a lender outbids, rejects, or does not act on an offer of fair consideration for the aboveground or underground storage tank or the facility or property on which the storage tank is located, it is presumed that the lender is not holding the ownership indicia primarily to protect the security interest unless the lender is required, in order to avoid liability under federal or state law, to make the higher bid, obtain the higher offer, or seek or obtain an offer in a different manner.

    Sec. 26.3515.  LIMITS ON LIABILITY OF CORPORATE FIDUCIARY.  (a)  A corporate fiduciary or its agent is not liable in an individual capacity as an owner or operator of an underground or aboveground storage tank under this subchapter solely because:
    
    (1)  the corporate fiduciary or its agent has legal title to real or personal property for purposes of administering a trust or estate of which the property is a part;  or
    
    (2)  the corporate fiduciary or its agent does not have legal title to the real or personal property but operates or manages the property under the terms of an estate or trust of which the property is a part.

    (b)  A taxing unit is not liable as an owner or operator under this subchapter solely because the taxing unit holds indicia of ownership because of a tax foreclosure sale under the Tax Code.
    
    (c)  If a taxing unit removes a tank from service or takes corrective action at any time after foreclosure, the taxing unit shall perform corrective action in accordance with requirements adopted by the commission under this subchapter.
    
    (d)  A taxing unit is not liable as an owner or operator under this subchapter solely because the taxing unit sells, releases, liquidates, or winds up operations and takes measures to preserve, protect, or prepare the secured aboveground or underground storage tank before sale or other disposition of the storage tank or the property if the taxing unit:
    
    (1)  did not participate in the management of an aboveground or underground storage tank or real or personal property described by Subsection (a) before foreclosure or an equivalent action on the storage tank or the property;  and
    
    (2)  establishes, as provided by Subsection (e), that the ownership indicia maintained after foreclosure continue to be held primarily to protect a payment of ad valorem taxes.

    Sec. 26.3574.  FEE ON DELIVERY OF CERTAIN PETROLEUM PRODUCTS.  (a)  In this section:
    
    (1)  "Bulk facility" means a facility in this state, including pipeline terminals, refinery terminals, rail and barge terminals, and associated underground and aboveground tanks, connected or separate, from which petroleum products are withdrawn from bulk and delivered into a cargo tank or a barge used to transport those products.  This term does not include petroleum products consumed at an electric generating facility.
    
    (2)  "Cargo tank" means an assembly that is used for transporting, hauling, or delivering liquids and that consists of a tank having one or more compartments mounted on a wagon, truck, trailer, railcar, or wheels.
    
    (2-a)  "Supplier" has the meaning assigned by Section [162.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=162.001), Tax Code.
    
    (3)  "Withdrawal from bulk" means the removal of a petroleum product from a bulk facility storage tank for delivery directly into a cargo tank or a barge to be transported to another location other than another bulk facility for distribution or sale in this state.
    
    (b)  A fee is imposed on the delivery of a petroleum product on withdrawal from bulk of that product as provided by this subsection.  Each supplier on withdrawal from bulk of a petroleum product shall collect from the person who orders the withdrawal a fee in an amount determined as follows:
    
    (1)  not more than $3.75 for each delivery into a cargo tank having a capacity of less than 2,500 gallons;
    
    (2)  not more than $7.50 for each delivery into a cargo tank having a capacity of 2,500 gallons or more but less than 5,000 gallons;
    
    (3)  not more than $11.75 for each delivery into a cargo tank having a capacity of 5,000 gallons or more but less than 8,000 gallons;
    
    (4)  not more than $15.00 for each delivery into a cargo tank having a capacity of 8,000 gallons or more but less than 10,000 gallons; and
    
    (5)  not more than $7.50 for each increment of 5,000 gallons or any part thereof delivered into a cargo tank having a capacity of 10,000 gallons or more.
    
    (b-1)  The commission by rule shall set the amount of the fee in Subsection (b) in an amount not to exceed the amount necessary to cover the agency's costs of administering this subchapter, as indicated by the amount appropriated by the legislature from the petroleum storage tank remediation account for that purpose, not including any amount appropriated by the legislature from the petroleum storage tank remediation account for the purpose of the monitoring or remediation of releases occurring on or before December 22, 1998.
    
    (c)  The fee collected under Subsection (b) of this section shall be computed on the net amount of a petroleum product delivered into a cargo tank.

    (e)  A supplier who receives petroleum products on which the fee has been paid may take credit for the fee paid on monthly reports.
    
    (f)  Subsection (b) does not apply to a delivery of a petroleum product destined for export from this state if the petroleum product is in continuous movement to a destination outside this state.  For purposes of this subsection, a petroleum product ceases to be in continuous movement to a destination outside this state if the product is delivered to a destination in this state.  The person that directs the delivery of the product to a destination in this state shall pay the fee imposed by this section on that product.
    
    (g)  Each supplier and each person covered by Subsection (d) shall file an application with the comptroller for a permit to deliver a petroleum product into a cargo tank destined for delivery to an underground or aboveground storage tank, regardless of whether or not the tank is exempt from regulation under Section [26.344](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=26.344).  A permit issued by the comptroller under this subsection is valid on and after the date of its issuance and until the permit is surrendered by the holder or canceled by the comptroller.

    (1)  the name under which the applicant transacts or intends to transact business;

    (4)  any other information required by the comptroller.
    
    (h)  A permit must be posted in a conspicuous place or kept available for inspection at the principal place of business of the owner.  A copy of the permit must be kept at each place of business or other place of storage from which petroleum products are delivered into cargo tanks and in each motor vehicle used by the permit holder to transport petroleum products by him for delivery into petroleum storage tanks in this state.
    
    (i)  Each supplier and each person covered by Subsection (d) shall:
    
    (1)  list, as a separate line item on an invoice or cargo manifest required under this section, the amount of the delivery fee due under this section; and
    
    (2)  on or before the 25th day of the month following the end of each calendar month, file a report with the comptroller and remit the amount of fees required to be collected or paid during the preceding month.
    
    (j)  Each supplier or the supplier's representative and each person covered by Subsection (d) shall prepare the report required under Subsection (i) on a form provided or approved by the comptroller.
    
    (k)  The cargo manifests or invoices or copies of the cargo manifests or invoices and any other records required under this section or rules of the comptroller must be maintained for a period of four years after the date on which the document or other record is prepared and be open for inspection by the comptroller at all reasonable times.
    
    (l)  As provided by the rules of the comptroller, the owner or lessee of a cargo tank or a common or contract carrier transporting a petroleum product shall possess a cargo manifest or an invoice showing the delivery point of the product, the amount of the required fee, and other information as required by rules of the comptroller.
    
    (m)  The comptroller shall adopt rules necessary for the administration, collection, reporting, and payment of the fees payable or collected under this section.
    
    (n)  A person who fails to file a report as provided by Subsection (i) of this section or who possesses a fee collected or payable under this section and who fails to remit the fee to the comptroller at the time and in the manner required by this section and rules of the comptroller shall pay a penalty of five percent of the amount of the fee due and payable.  If the person fails to file the report or pay the fee before the 30th day after the date on which the fee or report is due, the person shall pay a penalty of an additional five percent of the amount of the fee due and payable.
    
    (o)  Chapters [101](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=101) and 111-113, and Sections [162.005](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=162.005), [162.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=162.007), and [162.111](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=162.111)(b)-(k), Tax Code, apply to the administration, payment, collection, and enforcement of fees under this section in the same manner that those chapters apply to the administration, payment, collection, and enforcement of taxes under Title 2, Tax Code.
    
    (p)  The comptroller may add a penalty of 75 percent of the amount of the fee, penalty, and interest due if failure to file the report or pay the fee when it comes due is attributable to fraud or an intent to evade the application of this section or a rule made under this section or Chapter [111](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=111), Tax Code.
    
    (q)  The comptroller may require a bond or other security from a permittee and may establish the amount of the bond or other security.

    SUBCHAPTER J. GROUNDWATER PROTECTION
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 26.401.  LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.  (a)  The legislature finds that:
    
    (1)  in order to safeguard present and future groundwater supplies, usable and potentially usable groundwater must be protected and maintained;
    
    (2)  protection of the environment and public health and welfare requires that groundwater be kept reasonably free of contaminants that interfere with present and potential uses of groundwater;
    
    (3)  groundwater contamination may result from many sources, including current and past oil and gas production and related practices, agricultural activities, industrial and manufacturing processes, commercial and business endeavors, domestic activities, and natural sources that may be influenced by or may result from human activities;
    
    (4)  the various existing and potential groundwater uses are important to the state economy;  and
    
    (5)  aquifers vary both in their potential for beneficial use and in their susceptibility to contamination.
    
    (b)  The legislature determines that, consistent with the protection of the public health and welfare, the propagation and protection of terrestrial and aquatic life, the protection of the environment, the operation of existing industries, and the maintenance and enhancement of the long-term economic health of the state, it is the goal of groundwater policy in this state that the existing quality of groundwater not be degraded.  This goal of nondegradation does not mean zero-contaminant discharge.
    
    (c)  It is the policy of this state that:
    
    (1)  discharges of pollutants, disposal of wastes, or other activities subject to regulation by state agencies be conducted in a manner that will maintain present uses and not impair potential uses of groundwater or pose a public health hazard;  and
    
    (2)  the quality of groundwater be restored if feasible.
    
    (d)  The legislature recognizes the important role of the use of the best professional judgment of the responsible state agencies in attaining the groundwater goal and policy of this state.

    Sec. 26.556.  UNAUTHORIZED DISCHARGES OF CERTAIN WASTES WITHIN WATER QUALITY PROTECTION AREA; ENFORCEMENT.  (a)  The commission shall enforce this subchapter and impose administrative and civil penalties for discharges from a quarry in violation of this subchapter.  Subject to Subsection (d), the commission shall assess an administrative penalty against a responsible party of a quarry responsible for a discharge in violation of this subchapter or of a permit, rule, or order adopted or issued under this subchapter in an amount of not less than $2,500 and not more than $25,000 for each violation of this subchapter or of the permit, rule, or order adopted or issued under this subchapter.  Subject to Subsection (d), the commission shall assess an administrative penalty against a person for any other violation of this subchapter or of a permit, rule, or order adopted or issued under this subchapter in an amount of not less than $100 for each violation of this subchapter or of the permit, rule, or order adopted or issued under this subchapter.  Each day a violation continues may be considered a separate violation for purposes of penalty assessment.
    
    (b)  In determining the amount of the penalty, the commission shall consider:
    
    (1)  the nature, circumstances, extent, duration, and gravity of the prohibited acts, and the hazard or potential hazard the violation presents to the health, safety, or welfare of the public;
    
    (2)  the effects of the violation on instream uses, water quality, and fish and wildlife habitats;
    
    (3)  with respect to the alleged violator:
    
    (A)  the history and extent of previous violations;
    
    (B)  the degree of culpability, including whether the violation was attributable to mechanical or electrical failures and whether the violation could have been reasonably anticipated and avoided;
    
    (C)  demonstrated good faith, including actions taken by the alleged violator to rectify the cause of the violation and to compensate affected persons;
    
    (D)  whether the violator is engaged in a for-profit operation;
    
    (E)  any economic benefit gained through the violation; and
    
    (F)  the amount necessary to deter future violations; and
    
    (4)  any other matters that justice may require.
    
    (c)  In addition to the administrative penalties and other available remedies or causes of action, the commission may seek injunctive relief in the district courts of Travis County to:
    
    (1)  force the temporary or permanent closure of a quarry operated without authorization required under this subchapter;
    
    (2)  force the temporary or permanent closure of a permitted quarry under this subchapter for which acceptable evidence of financial responsibility is not maintained;
    
    (3)  force the temporary or permanent closure of any quarry responsible for an unauthorized discharge; or
    
    (4)  force corrective action by the responsible party of a quarry responsible for an unauthorized discharge.
    
    (d)  The commission may compromise, modify, or remit, with or without conditions, an administrative penalty imposed under this subchapter.  In determining the appropriate amount of a penalty for settlement of an administrative enforcement matter, the commission may consider a respondent's willingness to contribute to supplemental environmental projects that are approved by the commission, giving preference to projects that benefit the community in which the alleged violation occurred and address the remediation, reclamation, or restoration of the water quality and the beds, bottoms, and banks of water bodies in the water quality area adversely affected by unauthorized discharges from quarries or abandoned quarries that threaten water quality and the beds, bottoms, and banks of water bodies in the water quality area.  The commission may encourage the cleanup of contaminated property through the use of supplemental environmental projects.  The commission may not approve a project that is necessary to bring a respondent into compliance with environmental laws, that is necessary to remediate environmental harm caused by the respondent's alleged violation, or that the respondent has already agreed to perform under a preexisting agreement with a governmental agency.
    
    (e)  A violation of this subchapter also constitutes an offense that may be prosecuted and punished under Section [7.147](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=7.147).
    
    (f)  Nothing in this subchapter affects the right of any person that has a justiciable interest to pursue an available common law or statutory remedy to enforce a right, to prevent or seek redress or compensation for the violation of a right, or otherwise to redress an injury.
