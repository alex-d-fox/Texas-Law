    (c)  In determining whether deferral of a penalty under this section is appropriate, the commission shall consider the factors to be considered under Section [7.053](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=7.053) and the following factors:

    (B)  did not agree, before the date that the commission initiated the enforcement action, to perform the project.
    
    (a-2)  The commission shall develop a policy to prevent regulated entities from systematically avoiding compliance through the use of supplemental environmental projects under Subsection (a-1)(1), including a requirement for an assessment of:
    
    (1)  the respondent's financial ability to pay administrative penalties;
    
    (2)  the ability of the respondent to remediate the harm or come into compliance; and
    
    (3)  the need for corrective action.
    
    (b)  In this section:
    
    (1)  "Local government" means a school district, county, municipality, junior college district, river authority, water district or other special district, or other political subdivision created under the constitution or a statute of this state.
    
    (2)  "Supplemental environmental project" means a project that prevents pollution, reduces the amount of pollutants reaching the environment, enhances the quality of the environment, or contributes to public awareness of environmental matters.
    
    (c)  The commission may allow a local government or an organization exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a), Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as an organization described by Section 501(c)(3) of that code, that receives money from a respondent to implement a supplemental environmental project under this section to use a portion of the money, not to exceed 10 percent of the direct cost of the project, for administrative costs, including overhead costs, personnel salary and fringe benefits, and travel and per diem expenses, associated with implementing the project.  Money used for administrative costs under this subsection must be used in accordance with Chapter [783](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=783), Government Code.

This section does not prohibit a peace officer from issuing a citation or making an arrest.
    
    (c)  As soon as practicable and in no event later than the 45th day after receiving a notice and report under Subsection (b), the commission shall evaluate the report and determine whether an alleged environmental violation exists and whether administrative or civil remedies would adequately and appropriately address the alleged environmental violation.  In making its evaluation and determination, the commission shall consider the factors prescribed in Section [7.053](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=7.053).

    (2)  notwithstanding Subsection (e), the commission or the state is not entitled to receive any part of an amount recovered through a prosecution brought by that prosecuting attorney.
    
    (d)  If the commission determines that an alleged environmental violation exists and that administrative or civil remedies are inadequate or inappropriate to address the violation, the commission shall notify the peace officer in writing of the reasons why administrative or civil remedies are inadequate or inappropriate and recommending criminal prosecution, and the prosecuting attorney may proceed with the criminal prosecution of the alleged violation.  In all other cases, the commission shall issue written notification to the peace officer that the alleged environmental violation is to be resolved through administrative or civil means by the appropriate authorities and the reasons why administrative or civil remedies are adequate or appropriate.  A prosecuting attorney may not prosecute an alleged violation if the commission determines that administrative or civil remedies are adequate and appropriate.
    
    (e)  Any fine, penalty, or settlement recovered through a prosecution subject to this section and brought in the name and by authority of the State of Texas, whether recovered through any form of pretrial resolution, plea agreement, or sentencing after trial, shall be apportioned 70 percent to the state to cover the costs of instituting the procedures and requirements of Subsections (a)-(d) and 30 percent to any local government significantly involved in prosecuting the case.  In a case where the procedures described in this section do not apply, the provisions of Section [7.190](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=7.190) apply.

    Sec. 7.253.  DEFENSES AVAILABLE TO PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR SOLID WASTE VIOLATIONS.  (a)  For purposes of an enforcement action initiated under this chapter, a person responsible for solid waste under Section [361.271](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=361.271), Health and Safety Code, is liable for a violation of a statutory or regulatory prohibition against releasing or creating an imminent threat of releasing solid waste unless the person can establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the release or threatened release was caused solely by an act or omission of a third person and that the defendant:
    
    (1)  exercised due care concerning the solid waste, considering the characteristics of the solid waste, in light of all relevant facts and circumstances;  and
    
    (2)  took precautions against foreseeable acts or omissions of the third person and the consequences that could foreseeably result from those acts or omissions.
    
    (b)  The defense under Subsection (a) does not apply if the third person:
    
    (1)  is an employee or agent of the defendant;  or
    
    (2)  has a direct or indirect contractual relationship with the defendant and the act or omission of the third person occurred in connection with the contractual relationship.  The term "contractual relationship" includes land contracts, deeds, or other instruments transferring title or possession of real property.
    
    (c)  A defendant who enters into a contractual relationship as provided by Subsection (b)(2) is not liable under a statute or rule within the commission's jurisdiction if:
    
    (1)  the sole contractual relationship is acceptance for rail carriage by a common carrier under a published tariff;  or
    
    (2)  the defendant acquired the real property on which the facility requiring the remedial action is located after the disposal or placement of the hazardous substance on, in, or at the facility, and the defendant establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that:
    
    (A)  the defendant exercised due care concerning the solid waste, considering the characteristics of the solid waste, in light of all relevant facts and circumstances;  and
    
    (B)  the defendant took precautions against foreseeable acts or omissions of the third person and the consequences that could foreseeably result from those acts or omissions;  or
    
    (C)  at the time the defendant acquired the facility the defendant did not know and had no reason to know that a hazardous substance that is the subject of the release or threatened release was disposed of on, in, or at the facility;
    
    (D)  the defendant is a governmental entity that acquired the facility by escheat, by other involuntary transfer or acquisition, or by the exercise of the power of eminent domain;  or
    
    (E)  the defendant acquired the facility by inheritance or bequest.
    
    (d)  To demonstrate the condition under Subsection (c)(2)(C), the defendant must have made, at the time of acquisition, appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses of the property consistent with good commercial or customary practice in an effort to minimize liability.  In deciding whether the defendant meets this condition, the court shall consider:
    
    (1)  any specialized knowledge or experience of the defendant;
    
    (2)  the relationship of the purchase price to the value of the property if the property were uncontaminated;
    
    (3)  commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the property;
    
    (4)  the obvious presence or likely presence of contamination of the property;  and
    
    (5)  the defendant's ability to detect the contamination by appropriate inspection.
    
    (e)  This section does not decrease the liability of a previous owner or operator of a facility who is liable under a statute or rule within the commission's jurisdiction.  If the defendant obtained actual knowledge of the release or threatened release of a hazardous substance at a facility at the time the defendant owned the real property on which the facility is located and subsequently transferred ownership of the property to another person without disclosing that knowledge, the defendant is liable and a defense under this section is not available to the defendant.
    
    (f)  Subsections (c), (d), and (e) do not affect the liability, under a statute or rule within the commission's jurisdiction, of a defendant who, by an act or omission, caused or contributed to the release or threatened release of a hazardous substance that is the subject of the action concerning the facility.

    (1)  the person was in substantial compliance with that rule, permit, order, license, certificate, registration, approval, or other authorization while the alleged nuisance or trespass was occurring; or
    
    (2)  the commission or the federal government or an agency of the federal government exercised enforcement discretion in connection with the actions that resulted in the alleged nuisance or trespass.
