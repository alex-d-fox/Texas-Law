    (i)  The term "unappropriated flood waters" means water originating in the Pecos River Basin above Red Bluff Dam in Texas, the impoundment of which will not deplete the water usable by the storage and diversion facilities existing in either state under the 1947 condition and which if not impounded will flow past Girvin, Texas.
    
    Article III
    
      
    
    
    (a)  Except as stated in paragraph (f) of this Article, New Mexico shall not deplete by man's activities the flow of the Pecos River at the New Mexico-Texas state line below an amount which will give to Texas a quantity of water equivalent to that available to Texas under the 1947 condition.
    
    (b)  Except as to the unappropriated flood waters thereof, the apportionment of which is included in and provided for by paragraph (f) of this Article, the beneficial consumptive use of the waters of the Delaware River is hereby apportioned to Texas, and the quantity of such beneficial consumptive use shall be included in determining waters received under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this Article.
    
    (c)  The beneficial consumptive use of water salvaged in New Mexico through the construction and operation of a project or projects by the United States or by joint undertakings of Texas and New Mexico, is hereby apportioned forty-three per cent (43%) to Texas and fifty-seven per cent (57%) to New Mexico.
    
    (d)  Except as to water salvaged, apportioned in paragraph (c) of this Article, the beneficial consumptive use of water which shall be non-beneficially consumed, and which is recovered, is hereby apportioned to New Mexico but not to have the effect of diminishing the quantity of water available to Texas under the 1947 condition.
    
    (e)  Any water salvaged in Texas is hereby apportioned to Texas.

    (a)  The Report of the Engineering Advisory Committee, supplemented by additional data hereafter accumulated, shall be used by the Commission in making administrative determinations.
    
    (b)  Unless otherwise determined by the Commission, depletions by man's activities, state-line flows, quantities of water salvaged, and quantities of unappropriated flood waters shall be determined on the basis of three-year periods reckoned in continuing progressive series beginning with the first day of January next succeeding the ratification of this Compact.
    
    (c)  Unless and until a more feasible method is devised and adopted by the Commission the inflow-outflow method, as described in the Report of the Engineering Advisory Committee, shall be used to:
    
    (i)  Determine the effect on the state-line flow of any change in depletions by man's activities or otherwise, of the waters of the Pecos River in New Mexico.
    
    (ii)  Measure at or near the Avalon Dam in New Mexico the quantities of water salvaged.
    
    (iii)  Measure at or near the state line any water released from storage for the benefit of Texas as provided for in subparagraph (d) of this Article.
    
    (iv)  Measure the quantities of unappropriated flood waters apportioned to Texas which have not been stored and regulated by reservoirs in New Mexico.
    
    (v)  Measure any other quantities of water required to be measured under the terms of this Compact which are susceptible of being measured by the inflow-outflow method.
    
    (d)  If unappropriated flood waters apportioned to Texas are stored in facilities constructed in New Mexico, the following principles shall apply:
    
    (i)  In case of spill from a reservoir constructed in and operated by New Mexico, the water stored to the credit of Texas will be considered as the first water to spill.
    
    (ii)  In case of spill from a reservoir jointly constructed and operated, the water stored to the credit of either state shall not be affected.
    
    (iii)  Reservoir losses shall be charged to each state in proportion to the quantity of water belonging to that state in storage at the time the losses occur.
    
    (iv)  The water impounded to the credit of Texas shall be released by New Mexico on the demand of Texas.
    
    (e)  Water salvaged shall be measured at or near the Avalon Dam in New Mexico and to the quantity thereof shall be added a quantity equal to the quantity of salvaged water depleted by man's activities above Avalon Dam.  The quantity of water salvaged that is apportioned to Texas shall be delivered by New Mexico at the New Mexico-Texas state line.  The quantity of unappropriated flood waters impounded under paragraph (d) of this Article, when released shall be delivered by New Mexico at the New Mexico-Texas state line in the quantity released less channel losses.  The unappropriated flood waters apportioned to Texas by this Compact that are not impounded in reservoirs in New Mexico shall be measured and delivered at the New Mexico-Texas state line.
    
    (f)  Beneficial use shall be the basis, the measure, and the limit of the right to use water.
    
    Article VII
    
      
    
    
    In the event of importation of water by man's activities to the Pecos River Basin from any other river basin the state making the importation shall have the exclusive use of such imported water.
    
    Article VIII

    Article IX
    
      
    
    
    In maintaining the flows at the New Mexico-Texas state line required by this Compact, New Mexico shall in all instances apply the principle of prior appropriation within New Mexico.
    
    Article X
    
      
    
    
    The failure of either state to use the water, or any part thereof, the use of which is apportioned to it under the terms of this Compact, shall not constitute a relinquishment of the right to such use, nor shall it constitute a forfeiture or abandonment of the right to such use.
    
    Article XI
    
      
    
    
    Nothing in this Compact shall be construed as:

    The consumptive use of water by the United States or any of its agencies, instrumentalities or wards shall be charged as a use by the state in which the use is made;  provided, that such consumptive use incident to the diversion, impounding, or conveyance of water in one state for use in the other state shall be charged to such latter state.
    
    Article XIII
    
      
    
    
    This Compact shall not be construed as establishing any general principle or precedent applicable to other interstate streams.
    
    Article XIV
    
      
    
    
    This Compact may be terminated at any time by appropriate action of the legislatures of both of the signatory states.  In the event of such termination, all rights established under it shall continue unimpaired.
