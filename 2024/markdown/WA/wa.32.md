    (b)  In the permit, the commission shall impose terms and conditions reasonably necessary to protect fresh water from pollution.
    
    (c)  The commission, in determining if the use or installation of a subsurface area drip dispersal system is in the public interest under Subsection (a)(1), shall consider:
    
    (1)  compliance history of the applicant and related entities under the method for using compliance history developed by the commission under Section [5.754](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=5.754) and in accordance with the provisions of Subsection (d) of this section;

    (d)  The commission shall establish a procedure for the preparation of comprehensive summaries of the applicant's compliance history, including the compliance history of any corporation or other business entity managed, owned, or otherwise closely related to the applicant.  The summaries shall be made available to the applicant and any interested person after the commission has completed its technical review of the permit application and prior to giving public notice relating to the issuance of the permit.  Evidence of compliance or noncompliance by an applicant for a subsurface area drip dispersal system permit with environmental statutes and the rules adopted or orders or permits issued by the commission may be offered by any party at a hearing on the applicant's application and admitted into evidence subject to applicable rules of evidence.  Evidence of the compliance history of an applicant for a subsurface area drip dispersal system permit may be offered by the executive director at a hearing on the application and admitted into evidence subject to the rules of evidence.  The commission shall consider all evidence admitted, including compliance history, in determining whether to issue, amend, extend, or renew a permit.
