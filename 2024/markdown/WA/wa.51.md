Net revenue does not include money derived from taxation.
    
    (b)  A district which expects net revenue from operations may secure its bonds in any one of the following:
    
    (1)  as provided in Section [51.433](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=51.433) of this code;

    (3)  as provided in both Subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection.

    (b)  If three successive years demonstrate that this net revenue is adequate to protect the district's bonds as they mature, the district's tax may be discontinued until further experience demonstrates the necessity to continue the tax to avoid default in the payment of the district's bonds as they mature.
