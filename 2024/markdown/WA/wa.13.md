    Sec. 13.001.  LEGISLATIVE POLICY AND PURPOSE.  (a)  This chapter is adopted to protect the public interest inherent in the rates and services of retail public utilities.

    (3)  retail public utility rates, operations, and services are regulated by public agencies, with the objective that this regulation will operate as a substitute for competition.
    
    (c)  The purpose of this chapter is to establish a comprehensive regulatory system that is adequate to the task of regulating retail public utilities to assure rates, operations, and services that are just and reasonable to the consumers and to the retail public utilities.

    Sec. 13.043.  APPELLATE JURISDICTION.  (a)  Any party to a rate proceeding before the governing body of a municipality may appeal the decision of the governing body to the utility commission.  This subsection does not apply to a municipally owned utility.

The utility commission may establish the effective date for the utility commission's rates at the original effective date as proposed by the utility provider and may order refunds or allow a surcharge to recover lost revenues.  The utility commission may consider only the information that was available to the governing body at the time the governing body made its decision and evidence of reasonable expenses incurred in the appeal proceedings.
    
    (b)  Ratepayers of the following entities may appeal the decision of the governing body of the entity affecting their water, drainage, or sewer rates to the utility commission:

    (2)  a utility under the jurisdiction of a municipality inside the corporate limits of the municipality;
    
    (3)  a municipally owned utility, if the ratepayers reside outside the corporate limits of the municipality, including a decision of a governing body that results in an increase in rates when the municipally owned utility takes over the provision of service to ratepayers previously served by another retail public utility;
    
    (4)  a district or authority created under Article III, Section [52](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=3.52), or Article XVI, Section [59](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=16.59), of the Texas Constitution that provides water or sewer service to household users; and
    
    (5)  a utility owned by an affected county, if the ratepayer's rates are actually or may be adversely affected.  For the purposes of this section ratepayers who reside outside the boundaries of the district or authority shall be considered a separate class from ratepayers who reside inside those boundaries.
    
    (b-1)  A municipally owned utility shall:
    
    (1)  disclose to any person, on request, the number of ratepayers who reside outside the corporate limits of the municipality; and
    
    (2)  provide to any person, on request, a list of the names and addresses of the ratepayers who reside outside the corporate limits of the municipality.
    
    (b-2)  Unless a ratepayer has requested that a municipally owned utility disclose the ratepayer's personal information under Section [182.052](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&Value=182.052), Utilities Code, the municipally owned utility may not disclose the address of the ratepayer under Subsection (b-1)(2).
    
    (b-3)  The municipally owned utility may not charge a fee for disclosing the information under Subsection (b-1)(1). The municipally owned utility may charge a reasonable fee for providing information under Subsection (b-1)(2).  The municipally owned utility shall provide information requested under Subsection (b-1)(1) by telephone or in writing as preferred by the person making the request.
    
    (b-4)  Subsection (b)(3) does not apply to a municipally owned utility that takes over the provision of service to ratepayers previously served by another retail public utility if the municipally owned utility:
    
    (1)  takes over the service at the request of the ratepayer;
    
    (2)  takes over the service in the manner provided by Subchapter H; or 
    
    (3)  is required to take over the service by state law, an order of the commission, or an order of the utility commission. 
    
    (c)  An appeal under Subsection (b) must be initiated by filing a petition for review with the utility commission and the entity providing service within 90 days after the effective day of the rate change or, if appealing under Subdivision (b)(2) or (5), within 90 days after the date on which the governing body of the municipality or affected county makes a final decision.  The petition must be signed by the lesser of 10,000 or 10 percent of those ratepayers whose rates have been changed and who are eligible to appeal under Subsection (b).
    
    (d)  In an appeal under Subsection (b) of this section, each person receiving a separate bill is considered a ratepayer, but one person may not be considered more than one ratepayer regardless of the number of bills the person receives.  The petition for review is considered properly signed if signed by a person, or the spouse of a person, in whose name utility service is carried.
    
    (e)  In an appeal under Subsection (b), the utility commission shall hear the appeal de novo and shall fix in its final order the rates the governing body should have fixed in the action from which the appeal was taken.  The utility commission may establish the effective date for the utility commission's rates at the original effective date as proposed by the service provider, may order refunds or allow a surcharge to recover lost revenues, and may allow recovery of reasonable expenses incurred by the retail public utility in the appeal proceedings.  The utility commission may consider only the information that was available to the governing body at the time the governing body made its decision and evidence of reasonable expenses incurred by the retail public utility in the appeal proceedings.  The rates established by the utility commission in an appeal under Subsection (b) remain in effect until the first anniversary of the effective date proposed by the retail public utility for the rates being appealed or until changed by the service provider, whichever date is later, unless the utility commission determines that a financial hardship exists.
    
    (f)  A retail public utility that receives water or sewer service from another retail public utility or political subdivision of the state, including an affected county, may appeal to the utility commission a decision of the provider of water or sewer service affecting the amount paid for water or sewer service.  An appeal under this subsection must be initiated within 90 days after the date of notice of the decision is received from the provider of water or sewer service by the filing of a petition by the retail public utility.
    
    (g)  An applicant for service from an affected county or a water supply or sewer service corporation may appeal to the utility commission a decision of the county or water supply or sewer service corporation relating to any fee or amount to be paid to obtain service, other than the regular membership or tap fees or a groundwater conservation district or other governmental fee.  In addition to the factors specified under Subsection (j), in an appeal brought under this subsection the utility commission shall determine whether the amount paid by the applicant is consistent with the tariff of the water supply or sewer service corporation and is reasonably related to the cost of installing on-site and off-site facilities to provide service to that applicant.  If the utility commission finds the amount charged to be clearly unreasonable, it shall establish the fee to be paid for that applicant.  An appeal under this subsection must be initiated within 90 days after the date written notice is provided to the applicant or member of the decision of an affected county or water supply or sewer service corporation relating to the applicant's initial request for that service.  A determination made by the utility commission on an appeal under this subsection is binding on all similarly situated applicants for service, and the utility commission may not consider other appeals on the same issue until the applicable provisions of the tariff of the water supply or sewer service corporation are amended.
    
    (g-1)  An applicant for service from a water supply or sewer service corporation may appeal to the utility commission for a determination of whether the regular membership fee or tap fee required to be paid to obtain service is consistent with the tariff of the water supply or sewer service corporation.  If the utility commission finds that the fee is inconsistent with the tariff of the water supply or sewer service corporation, the utility commission shall issue an order requiring the water supply or sewer service corporation to charge the applicant an amount consistent with the tariff.  An appeal under this subsection must be initiated not later than the 30th day after the date the water supply or sewer service corporation provides the applicant with the cost of obtaining service.
    
    (h)  The utility commission may, on a motion by the utility commission or by the appellant under Subsection (a), (b), or (f), establish interim rates to be in effect until a final decision is made.
    
    (i)  The governing body of a municipally owned utility or a political subdivision, within 60 days after the date of a final decision on a rate change, shall provide individual written notice to each ratepayer eligible to appeal who resides outside the boundaries of the municipality or the political subdivision.  The notice must include, at a minimum, the effective date of the new rates, the new rates, and the location where additional information on rates can be obtained.  The governing body of a municipally owned utility or a political subdivision may provide the notice electronically if the utility or political subdivision has access to a ratepayer's e-mail address.
    
    (j)  In an appeal under this section, the utility commission shall ensure that every appealed rate is just and reasonable.  Rates shall not be unreasonably preferential, prejudicial, or discriminatory but shall be sufficient, equitable, and consistent in application to each class of customers.  The utility commission shall use a methodology that preserves the financial integrity of the retail public utility.  For agreements between municipalities the utility commission shall consider the terms of any wholesale water or sewer service agreement in an appellate rate proceeding.
    
    (k)  Not later than the 30th day after the date of a final decision on a rate change, the commissioners court of an affected county shall provide written notice to each ratepayer eligible to appeal.  The notice must include the effective date of the new rates, the new rates, and the location where additional information on rates may be obtained.

    (c)  The utility commission shall provide a reasonable period for the retail public utility that takes over the nonfunctioning system to bring the nonfunctioning system into compliance with utility commission and commission rules during which the utility commission or the commission may not impose a penalty for any deficiency in the system that is present at the time the utility takes over the nonfunctioning system.  The utility commission must consult with the utility before determining the period and may grant an extension of the period for good cause.

(a)  Every water and sewer utility shall keep and render to the regulatory authority in the manner and form prescribed by the utility commission uniform accounts of all business transacted.  The utility commission may also prescribe forms of books, accounts, records, and memoranda to be kept by those utilities, including the books, accounts, records, and memoranda of the rendition of and capacity for service as well as the receipts and expenditures of money, and any other forms, records, and memoranda that in the judgment of the utility commission may be necessary to carry out this chapter.
    
    (b)  In the case of a utility subject to regulation by a federal regulatory agency, compliance with the system of accounts prescribed for the particular class of utilities by that agency may be considered a sufficient compliance with the system prescribed by the utility commission.  However, the utility commission may prescribe forms of books, accounts, records, and memoranda covering information in addition to that required by the federal agency.  The system of accounts and the forms of books, accounts, records, and memoranda prescribed by the utility commission for a utility or class of utilities may not conflict or be inconsistent with the systems and forms established by a federal agency for that utility or class of utilities.
    
    (c)  The utility commission shall fix proper and adequate rates and methods of depreciation, amortization, or depletion of the several classes of property of each utility and shall require every utility to carry a proper and adequate depreciation account in accordance with those rates and methods and with any other rules the utility commission prescribes.  Rules adopted under this subsection must require the book cost less net salvage of depreciable utility plant retired to be charged in its entirety to the accumulated depreciation account in a manner consistent with accounting treatment of regulated electric and gas utilities in this state.  Those rates, methods, and accounts shall be utilized uniformly and consistently throughout the rate-setting and appeal proceedings.
    
    (d)  Every utility shall keep separate accounts to show all profits or losses resulting from the sale or lease of appliances, fixtures, equipment, or other merchandise.  A profit or loss may not be taken into consideration by the regulatory authority in arriving at any rate to be charged for service by a utility to the extent that the merchandise is not integral to the provision of utility service.
    
    (e)  Every utility is required to keep and render its books, accounts, records, and memoranda accurately and faithfully in the manner and form prescribed by the utility commission and to comply with all directions of the regulatory authority relating to those books, accounts, records, and memoranda.  The regulatory authority may require the examination and audit of all accounts.
    
    (f)  In determining the allocation of tax savings derived from application of methods such as liberalized depreciation and amortization and the investment tax credit, the regulatory authority shall equitably balance the interests of present and future customers and shall apportion those benefits between consumers and the utilities accordingly.  If any portion of the investment tax credit has been retained by a utility, that amount shall be deducted from the original cost of the facilities or other addition to the rate base to which the credit applied to the extent allowed by the Internal Revenue Code.

    SUBCHAPTER F. PROCEEDINGS BEFORE REGULATORY AUTHORITY
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 13.181.  POWER TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE;  RATE REGULATION.  (a)  Except for the provisions of Section [13.192](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=13.192), this subchapter shall apply only to a utility and shall not be applied to municipalities, counties, districts, or water supply or sewer service corporations.
    
    (b)  Subject to this chapter, the utility commission has all authority and power of the state to ensure compliance with the obligations of utilities under this chapter.  For this purpose the regulatory authority may fix and regulate rates of utilities, including rules and regulations for determining the classification of customers and services and for determining the applicability of rates.  A rule or order of the regulatory authority may not conflict with the rulings of any federal regulatory body.  The utility commission may adopt rules which authorize a utility which is permitted under Section [13.242](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=13.242)(c) to provide service without a certificate of public convenience and necessity to request or implement a rate increase and operate according to rules, regulations, and standards of service other than those otherwise required under this chapter provided that rates are just and reasonable for customers and the utility and that service is safe, adequate, efficient, and reasonable.

    Sec. 13.182.  JUST AND REASONABLE RATES.  (a)  The regulatory authority shall ensure that every rate made, demanded, or received by any utility or by any two or more utilities jointly shall be just and reasonable.
    
    (b)  Except as provided by Subsection (b-1), rates may not be unreasonably preferential, prejudicial, or discriminatory but shall be sufficient, equitable, and consistent in application to each class of consumers.
    
    (b-1)  In establishing a utility's rates, the regulatory authority may authorize the utility to establish reduced rates for a minimal level of service to be provided solely to a class of elderly customers 65 years of age or older to ensure that those customers receive that level of service at more affordable rates.  The regulatory authority shall allow a utility to establish a fund to receive donations to recover the costs of providing the reduced rates.  A utility may not recover those costs through charges to the utility's other customer classes.
    
    (c)  For ratemaking purposes, the utility commission may treat two or more municipalities served by a utility as a single class wherever the utility commission considers that treatment to be appropriate.
    
    (d)  The utility commission by rule shall establish a preference that rates under a consolidated tariff be consolidated by region.  The regions under consolidated tariffs must be determined on a case-by-case basis.

    Sec. 13.183.  FIXING OVERALL REVENUES.  (a)  In fixing the rates for water and sewer services, the regulatory authority shall fix its overall revenues at a level that will:
    
    (1)  permit the utility a reasonable opportunity to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital used and useful in rendering service to the public over and above its reasonable and necessary operating expenses;  and
    
    (2)  preserve the financial integrity of the utility.
    
    (b)  In a rate proceeding, the regulatory authority may authorize collection of additional revenues from the customers to provide funds for capital improvements necessary to provide facilities capable of providing adequate and continuous utility service if an accurate accounting of the collection and use of those funds is provided to the regulatory authority.  A facility constructed with surcharge funds is considered customer contributed capital or contributions in aid of construction and may not be included in invested capital, and depreciation expense is not allowed.
    
    (c)  To ensure that retail customers receive a higher quality, more affordable, or more reliable water or sewer service, to encourage regionalization, or to maintain financially stable and technically sound utilities, the regulatory authority, by rule or ordinance, as appropriate, may adopt specific alternative ratemaking methodologies for water or sewer rates to allow for more timely and efficient cost recovery.  Appropriate alternative ratemaking methodologies are the introduction of new customer classes, the cash needs method, and phased and multi-step rate changes.  The regulatory authority may also adopt system improvement charges that may be periodically adjusted to ensure timely recovery of infrastructure investment.  The utility commission by rule shall establish a schedule that requires all utilities that have implemented a system improvement charge approved by the utility commission to make periodic filings with the utility commission to modify or review base rates charged by the utility.  Overall revenues determined according to an alternative ratemaking methodology adopted under this section must provide revenues to the utility that satisfy the requirements of Subsection (a).  The regulatory authority may not approve rates under an alternative ratemaking methodology unless the regulatory authority adopts the methodology before the date the rate application was administratively complete.
    
    (d)  A regulatory authority other than the utility commission may not approve an acquisition adjustment for a system purchased before the effective date of an ordinance authorizing acquisition adjustments.
    
    (e)  In determining to use an alternative ratemaking methodology, the regulatory authority shall assure that rates, operations, and services are just and reasonable to the consumers and to the utilities.

    Sec. 13.184.  FAIR RETURN;  BURDEN OF PROOF.  (a)  Unless the utility commission establishes alternate rate methodologies in accordance with Section [13.183](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=13.183)(c), the utility commission may not prescribe any rate that will yield more than a fair return on the invested capital used and useful in rendering service to the public.  The governing body of a municipality exercising its original jurisdiction over rates and services may use alternate ratemaking methodologies established by ordinance or by utility commission rule in accordance with Section [13.183](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=13.183)(c).  Unless the municipal regulatory authority uses alternate ratemaking methodologies established by ordinance or by utility commission rule in accordance with Section [13.183](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=13.183)(c), it may not prescribe any rate that will yield more than a fair return on the invested capital used and useful in rendering service to the public.
    
    (b)  In fixing a reasonable return on invested capital, the regulatory authority shall consider, in addition to other applicable factors, the efforts and achievements of the utility in the conservation of resources, the quality of the utility's services, the efficiency of the utility's operations, and the quality of the utility's management.
    
    (c)  In any proceeding involving any proposed change of rates, the burden of proof shall be on the utility to show that the proposed change, if proposed by the utility, or that the existing rate, if it is proposed to reduce the rate, is just and reasonable.

    Sec. 13.185.  COMPONENTS OF INVESTED CAPITAL AND NET INCOME.  (a)  Unless alternate methodologies are adopted as provided in Sections [13.183](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=13.183)(c) and [13.184](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=13.184)(a), the components of invested capital and net income shall be determined according to the rules stated in this section.
    
    (b)  Utility rates shall be based on the original cost of property used by and useful to the utility in providing service, including, if necessary to the financial integrity of the utility, construction work in progress at cost as recorded on the books of the utility.  The inclusion of construction work in progress is an exceptional form of rate relief to be granted only on the demonstration by the utility by clear and convincing evidence that the inclusion is in the ratepayers' best interest and is necessary to the financial integrity of the utility. Construction work in progress may not be included in the rate base for major projects under construction to the extent that those projects have been inefficiently or imprudently planned or managed.  Original cost is the actual money cost or the actual money value of any consideration paid, other than money, of the property at the time it shall have been dedicated to public use, whether by the utility that is the present owner or by a predecessor, less depreciation.  Utility property funded by explicit customer agreements or customer contributions in aid of construction such as surcharges may not be included in invested capital.
    
    (c)  Cost of facilities, revenues, expenses, taxes, and reserves shall be separated or allocated as prescribed by the regulatory authority.
    
    (d)  Net income is the total revenues of the utility less all reasonable and necessary expenses as determined by the regulatory authority.  The regulatory authority shall:
    
    (1)  base a utility's expenses on historic test year information adjusted for known and measurable changes, as determined by utility commission rules; and
    
    (2)  determine expenses and revenues in a manner consistent with Subsections (e) through (h) of this section.
    
    (e)  Payment to affiliated interests for costs of any services, or any property, right or thing, or for interest expense may not be allowed either as capital cost or as expense except to the extent that the regulatory authority finds that payment to be reasonable and necessary.  A finding of reasonableness and necessity must include specific statements setting forth the cost to the affiliate of each item or class of items in question and a finding that the price to the utility is no higher than prices charged by the supplying affiliate to its other affiliates or divisions for the same item or items, or to unaffiliated persons or corporations.
    
    (f)  If an expense is allowed to be included in utility rates or an investment is included in the utility rate base, the related income tax benefit must be included in the computation of income tax expense to reduce the rates. If an expense is not allowed to be included in utility rates or an investment is not included in the utility rate base, the related income tax benefit may not be included in the computation of income tax expense to reduce the rates.  The income tax expense shall be computed using the statutory income tax rates.  The amount of income tax that a consolidated group of which a utility is a member saves, because the consolidated return eliminates the intercompany profit on purchases by the utility from an affiliate, shall be applied to reduce the cost of the property or service purchased from the affiliate.   The investment tax credit allowed against federal income taxes to the extent retained by the utility shall be applied as a reduction in the rate-based contribution of the assets to which the credit applies to the extent and at the rate as allowed by the Internal Revenue Code.
    
    (g)  The regulatory authority may promulgate reasonable rules and regulations with respect to the allowance or disallowance of certain expenses for ratemaking purposes.
    
    (h)  The regulatory authority may not include for ratemaking purposes:
    
    (1)  legislative advocacy expenses, whether made directly or indirectly, including legislative advocacy expenses included in trade association dues;
    
    (2)  costs of processing a refund or credit under this subchapter; or
    
    (3)  any expenditure found by the regulatory authority to be unreasonable, unnecessary, or not in the public interest, including executive salaries, advertising expenses, legal expenses, and civil penalties or fines.
    
    (i)  Water and sewer utility property in service that was acquired from an affiliate or developer before September 1, 1976, and that is included by the utility in its rate base shall be included in all ratemaking formulas at the installed cost of the property rather than the price set between the entities.  Unless the funds for this property are provided by explicit customer agreements, the property is considered invested capital and not contributions in aid of construction or customer-contributed capital.
    
    (j)  Depreciation expense included in the cost of service includes depreciation on all currently used, depreciable utility property owned by the utility except for property provided by explicit customer agreements or funded by customer contributions in aid of construction.  Depreciation on all currently used and useful developer or governmental entity contributed property shall be allowed in the cost of service.

Those rates constitute the legal rates of the utility until changed as provided in this chapter.

    Sec. 13.187.  CLASS A UTILITIES: STATEMENT OF INTENT TO CHANGE RATES; HEARING; DETERMINATION OF RATE LEVEL.  (a)  This section applies only to a Class A utility.
    
    (a-1)  A utility may not make changes in its rates except by sending by mail or e-mail a statement of intent to each ratepayer and to the regulatory authority having original jurisdiction at least 35 days before the effective date of the proposed change.  The utility may send the statement of intent to a ratepayer by e-mail only if the ratepayer has agreed to receive communications electronically.  The effective date of the new rates must be the first day of a billing period, and the new rates may not apply to service received before the effective date of the new rates.  The statement of intent must include:
    
    (1)  the information required by the regulatory authority's rules;
    
    (2)  a billing comparison regarding the existing water rate and the new water rate computed for the use of:
    
    (A)  5,000 gallons of water; and
    
    (B)  10,000 gallons of water;
    
    (3)  a billing comparison regarding the existing sewer rate and the new sewer rate computed for the use of 5,000 gallons, unless the utility proposes a flat rate for sewer services; and
    
    (4)  a description of the process by which a ratepayer may intervene in the ratemaking proceeding.
    
    (b)  The utility shall mail, send by e-mail, or deliver a copy of the statement of intent to the Office of Public Utility Counsel, appropriate offices of each affected municipality, and any other affected persons as required by the regulatory authority's rules.
    
    (c)  When the statement of intent is delivered, the utility shall file with the regulatory authority an application to change rates.  The application must include information the regulatory authority requires by rule and any appropriate cost and rate schedules and written testimony supporting the requested rate increase.  If the utility fails to provide within a reasonable time after the application is filed the necessary documentation or other evidence that supports the costs and expenses that are shown in the application, the regulatory authority may disallow the nonsupported costs or expenses.
    
    (d)  Except as provided by Subsections (d-1) and (e), if the application or the statement of intent is not substantially complete or does not comply with the regulatory authority's rules, it may be rejected and the effective date of the rate change may be suspended until a properly completed application is accepted by the regulatory authority and a proper statement of intent is provided.  The utility commission may also suspend the effective date of any rate change if the utility does not have a certificate of public convenience and necessity or a completed application for a certificate or to transfer a certificate pending before the utility commission or if the utility is delinquent in paying the assessment and any applicable penalties or interest required by Section [5.701](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=5.701)(n).
    
    (d-1)  After written notice to the utility, a local regulatory authority may suspend the effective date of a rate change for not more than 90 days from the proposed effective date.  If the local regulatory authority does not make a final determination on the proposed rate before the expiration of the suspension period, the proposed rate shall be considered approved.  This approval is subject to the authority of the local regulatory authority thereafter to continue a hearing in progress.
    
    (e)  After written notice to the utility, the utility commission may suspend the effective date of a rate change for not more than 150 days from the proposed effective date.  If the utility commission does not make a final determination on the proposed rate before the expiration of the suspension period, the proposed rate shall be considered approved.  This approval is subject to the authority of the utility commission thereafter to continue a hearing in progress.
    
    (e-1)  The 150-day period described by Subsection (e) shall be extended two days for each day a hearing exceeds 15 days.
    
    (f)  The regulatory authority shall, not later than the 30th day after the effective date of the change, begin a hearing to determine the propriety of the change.  If the regulatory authority is the utility commission, the utility commission may refer the matter to the State Office of Administrative Hearings as provided by utility commission rules.
    
    (g)  A local regulatory authority hearing described by this section may be informal.
    
    (g-1)  If the regulatory authority is the utility commission, the utility commission shall give reasonable notice of the hearing, including notice to the governing body of each affected municipality and county.  The utility commission may delegate to an administrative law judge of the State Office of Administrative Hearings the responsibility and authority to give reasonable notice of the hearing, including notice to the governing body of each affected municipality and county.  The utility is not required to provide a formal answer or file any other formal pleading in response to the notice, and the absence of an answer does not affect an order for a hearing.
    
    (h)  If, after hearing, the regulatory authority finds the rates currently being charged or those proposed to be charged are unreasonable or in violation of law, the regulatory authority shall determine the rates to be charged by the utility and shall fix the rates by order served on the utility.
    
    (i)  A utility may put a changed rate into effect throughout the area in which the utility sought to change its rates, including an area over which the utility commission is exercising appellate or original jurisdiction, by filing a bond with the utility commission if the suspension period has been extended under Subsection (e-1) and the utility commission fails to make a final determination before the 151st day after the date the rate change would otherwise be effective.
    
    (j)  The bonded rate may not exceed the proposed rate.  The bond must be payable to the utility commission in an amount, in a form, and with a surety approved by the utility commission and conditioned on refund.
    
    (k)  Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties to the rate proceeding, the utility shall refund or credit against future bills:
    
    (1)  all sums collected under the bonded rates in excess of the rate finally ordered; and
    
    (2)  interest on those sums at the current interest rate as determined by the regulatory authority.
    
    (l)  At any time during the pendency of the rate proceeding the regulatory authority may fix interim rates to remain in effect during the applicable suspension period under Subsection (d-1) or Subsections (e) and (e-1) or until a final determination is made on the proposed rate.  If the regulatory authority does not establish interim rates, the rates in effect when the application described by Subsection (c) was filed continue in effect during the suspension period.
    
    (m)  If the regulatory authority sets a final rate that is higher than the interim rate, the utility shall be allowed to collect the difference between the interim rate and final rate unless otherwise agreed to by the parties to the rate proceeding.
    
    (n)  For good cause shown, the regulatory authority may at any time during the proceeding require the utility to refund money collected under a proposed rate before the rate was suspended or an interim rate was established to the extent the proposed rate exceeds the existing rate or the interim rate.
    
    (o)  If a regulatory authority other than the utility commission establishes interim rates or bonded rates, the regulatory authority must make a final determination on the rates not later than the first anniversary of the effective date of the interim rates or bonded rates or the rates are automatically approved as requested by the utility.
    
    (p)  Except to implement a rate adjustment provision approved by the regulatory authority by rule or ordinance, as applicable, or to adjust the rates of a newly acquired utility system, a utility or two or more utilities under common control and ownership may not file a statement of intent to increase its rates more than once in a 12-month period, unless the regulatory authority determines that a financial hardship exists.  If the regulatory authority requires the utility to deliver a corrected statement of intent, the utility is not considered to be in violation of the 12-month filing requirement.

    Sec. 13.1871.  CLASS B UTILITIES:  STATEMENT OF INTENT TO CHANGE RATES; HEARING; DETERMINATION OF RATE LEVEL.  (a)  Except as provided by Sections [13.18715](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=13.18715) and [13.1872](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=13.1872), this section applies only to a Class B utility.
    
    (b)  A utility may not make changes in its rates except by sending by mail or e-mail a statement of intent to each ratepayer and to the regulatory authority having original jurisdiction at least 35 days before the effective date of the proposed change.  The utility may send the statement of intent to a ratepayer by e-mail only if the ratepayer has agreed to receive communications electronically.  The effective date of the new rates must be the first day of a billing period, and the new rates may not apply to service received before the effective date of the new rates.  The statement of intent must include:
    
    (1)  the information required by the regulatory authority's rules;
    
    (2)  a billing comparison regarding the existing water rate and the new water rate computed for the use of:
    
    (A)  5,000 gallons of water; and
    
    (B)  10,000 gallons of water;
    
    (3)  a billing comparison regarding the existing sewer rate and the new sewer rate computed for the use of 5,000 gallons, unless the utility proposes a flat rate for sewer services; and
    
    (4)  a description of the process by which a ratepayer may file a complaint under Subsection (i).
    
    (c)  The utility shall mail, send by e-mail, or deliver a copy of the statement of intent to the appropriate offices of each affected municipality and to any other affected persons as required by the regulatory authority's rules.
    
    (d)  When the statement of intent is delivered, the utility shall file with the regulatory authority an application to change rates.  The application must include information the regulatory authority requires by rule and any appropriate cost and rate schedules supporting the requested rate increase.   If the utility fails to provide within a reasonable time after the application is filed the necessary documentation or other evidence that supports the costs and expenses that are shown in the application, the regulatory authority may disallow the nonsupported costs or expenses.
    
    (e)  Except as provided by Subsection (f) or (g), if the application or the statement of intent is not substantially complete or does not comply with the regulatory authority's rules, it may be rejected and the effective date of the rate change may be suspended until a properly completed application is accepted by the regulatory authority and a proper statement of intent is provided.  The utility commission may also suspend the effective date of any rate change if the utility does not have a certificate of public convenience and necessity or a completed application for a certificate or to transfer a certificate pending before the utility commission or if the utility is delinquent in paying the assessment and any applicable penalties or interest required by Section [5.701](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=5.701)(n).
    
    (f)  After written notice to the utility, a local regulatory authority may suspend the effective date of a rate change for not more than 90 days from the proposed effective date.  If the local regulatory authority does not make a final determination on the proposed rate before the expiration of the suspension period, the proposed rate shall be considered approved.  This approval is subject to the authority of the local regulatory authority thereafter to continue a hearing in progress.
    
    (g)  After written notice to the utility, the utility commission may suspend the effective date of a rate change for not more than 265 days from the proposed effective date.  If the utility commission does not make a final determination on the proposed rate before the expiration of the suspension period, the proposed rate shall be considered approved.  This approval is subject to the authority of the utility commission thereafter to continue a hearing in progress.
    
    (h)  The 265-day period described by Subsection (g) shall be extended by two days for each day a hearing exceeds 15 days.
    
    (i)  If, before the 91st day after the effective date of the rate change, the regulatory authority receives a complaint from any affected municipality, or from the lesser of 1,000 or 10 percent of the ratepayers of the utility over whose rates the regulatory authority has original jurisdiction, the regulatory authority shall set the matter for hearing.
    
    (j)  If the regulatory authority receives at least the number of complaints from ratepayers required for the regulatory authority to set a hearing under Subsection (i), the regulatory authority may, pending the hearing and a decision, suspend the date the rate change would otherwise be effective.  Except as provided by Subsection (h), the proposed rate may not be suspended for longer than:
    
    (1)  90 days by a local regulatory authority; or
    
    (2)  265 days by the utility commission.
    
    (k)  The regulatory authority may set the matter for hearing on its own motion at any time within 120 days after the effective date of the rate change.
    
    (l)  The hearing may be informal.
    
    (m)  The regulatory authority shall give reasonable notice of the hearing, including notice to the governing body of each affected municipality and county.  The utility commission may delegate to an administrative law judge of the State Office of Administrative Hearings the responsibility and authority to give reasonable notice for the hearing, including notice to the governing body of each affected municipality and county.  The utility is not required to provide a formal answer or file any other formal pleading in response to the notice, and the absence of an answer does not affect an order for a hearing.
    
    (n)  The utility shall mail notice of the hearing to each ratepayer before the hearing.  The notice must include a description of the process by which a ratepayer may intervene in the ratemaking proceeding.
    
    (o)  If, after hearing, the regulatory authority finds the rates currently being charged or those proposed to be charged are unreasonable or in violation of law, the regulatory authority shall determine the rates to be charged by the utility and shall fix the rates by order served on the utility.
    
    (p)  A utility may put a changed rate into effect throughout the area in which the utility sought to change its rates, including an area over which the utility commission is exercising appellate or original jurisdiction, by filing a bond with the utility commission if the suspension period has been extended under Subsection (h) and the utility commission fails to make a final determination before the 266th day after the date the rate change would otherwise be effective.
    
    (q)  The bonded rate may not exceed the proposed rate.  The bond must be payable to the utility commission in an amount, in a form, and with a surety approved by the utility commission and conditioned on refund.
    
    (r)  Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties to the rate proceeding, the utility shall refund or credit against future bills:
    
    (1)  all sums collected under the bonded rates in excess of the rate finally ordered; and
    
    (2)  interest on those sums at the current interest rate as determined by the regulatory authority.
    
    (s)  At any time during the pendency of the rate proceeding the regulatory authority may fix interim rates to remain in effect during the applicable suspension period under Subsection (f) or Subsections (g) and (h) or until a final determination is made on the proposed rate.  If the regulatory authority does not establish interim rates, the rates in effect when the application described by Subsection (d) was filed continue in effect during the suspension period.
    
    (t)  If the regulatory authority sets a final rate that is higher than the interim rate, the utility shall be allowed to collect the difference between the interim rate and final rate unless otherwise agreed to by the parties to the rate proceeding.
    
    (u)  For good cause shown, the regulatory authority may at any time during the proceeding require the utility to refund money collected under a proposed rate before the rate was suspended or an interim rate was established to the extent the proposed rate exceeds the existing rate or the interim rate.
    
    (v)  If a regulatory authority other than the utility commission establishes interim rates or bonded rates, the regulatory authority must make a final determination on the rates not later than the first anniversary of the effective date of the interim rates or bonded rates or the rates are automatically approved as requested by the utility.
    
    (w)  Except to implement a rate adjustment provision approved by the regulatory authority by rule or ordinance, as applicable, or to adjust the rates of a newly acquired utility system, a utility or two or more utilities under common control and ownership may not file a statement of intent to increase its rates more than once in a 12-month period, unless the regulatory authority determines that a financial hardship exists.  If the regulatory authority requires the utility to deliver a corrected statement of intent, the utility is not considered to be in violation of the 12-month filing requirement.

    Sec. 13.246.  NOTICE AND HEARING; ISSUANCE OR REFUSAL; FACTORS CONSIDERED.  (a)  If an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity or for an amendment to a certificate is filed, the utility commission shall cause notice of the application to be given to affected parties and to each county and groundwater conservation district that is wholly or partly included in the area proposed to be certified.  If requested, the utility commission shall fix a time and place for a hearing and give notice of the hearing.  Any person affected by the application may intervene at the hearing.
    
    (a-1)  Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, in addition to the notice required by Subsection (a), the utility commission shall require notice to be mailed to each owner of a tract of land that is at least 25 acres and is wholly or partially included in the area proposed to be certified.  Notice required under this subsection must be mailed by first class mail to the owner of the tract according to the most current tax appraisal rolls of the applicable central appraisal district at the time the utility commission received the application for the certificate or amendment.  Good faith efforts to comply with the requirements of this subsection shall be considered adequate notice to landowners.  Notice under this subsection is not required for a matter filed with the utility commission or the commission under:
    
    (1)  Section [13.248](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=13.248) or [13.255](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=13.255); or
    
    (2)  Chapter [65](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=65).
    
    (b)  The utility commission may grant applications and issue certificates and amendments to certificates only if the utility commission finds that a certificate or amendment is necessary for the service, accommodation, convenience, or safety of the public.  The utility commission may issue a certificate or amendment as requested, or refuse to issue it, or issue it for the construction of only a portion of the contemplated system or facility or extension, or for the partial exercise only of the right or privilege and may impose special conditions necessary to ensure that continuous and adequate service is provided.
    
    (c)  Certificates of public convenience and necessity and amendments to certificates shall be granted by the utility commission on a nondiscriminatory basis after consideration by the utility commission of:
    
    (1)  the adequacy of service currently provided to the requested area;
    
    (2)  the need for additional service in the requested area, including whether any landowners, prospective landowners, tenants, or residents have requested service;
    
    (3)  the effect of the granting of a certificate or of an amendment on the recipient of the certificate or amendment, on the landowners in the area, and on any retail public utility of the same kind already serving the proximate area;
    
    (4)  the ability of the applicant to provide adequate service, including meeting the standards of the commission, taking into consideration the current and projected density and land use of the area;
    
    (5)  the feasibility of obtaining service from an adjacent retail public utility;
    
    (6)  the financial ability of the applicant to pay for the facilities necessary to provide continuous and adequate service and the financial stability of the applicant, including, if applicable, the adequacy of the applicant's debt-equity ratio;
    
    (7)  environmental integrity;
    
    (8)  the probable improvement of service or lowering of cost to consumers in that area resulting from the granting of the certificate or amendment; and
    
    (9)  the effect on the land to be included in the certificated area.
    
    (d)  The utility commission may require an applicant for a certificate or for an amendment to provide a bond or other financial assurance in a form and amount specified by the utility commission to ensure that continuous and adequate utility service is provided.
    
    (e)  Where applicable, in addition to the other factors in this section the utility commission shall consider the efforts of the applicant:
    
    (1)  to extend service to any economically distressed areas located within the service areas certificated to the applicant; and
    
    (2)  to enforce the rules adopted under Section [16.343](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=16.343).
    
    (f)  If two or more retail public utilities or water supply or sewer service corporations apply for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to provide water or sewer utility service to an uncertificated area located in an economically distressed area and otherwise meet the requirements for obtaining a new certificate, the utility commission shall grant the certificate to the retail public utility or water supply or sewer service corporation that is more capable financially, managerially, and technically of providing continuous and adequate service.
    
    (g)  In this section, "economically distressed area" has the meaning assigned by Section [15.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=15.001).
    
    (h)  Except as provided by Subsection (i), a landowner who owns a tract of land that is at least 25 acres and that is wholly or partially located within the proposed service area may elect to exclude some or all of the landowner's property from the proposed service area by providing written notice to the utility commission before the 30th day after the date the landowner receives notice of a new application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity or for an amendment to an existing certificate of public convenience and necessity.  The landowner's election is effective without a further hearing or other process by the utility commission.  If a landowner makes an election under this subsection, the application shall be modified so that the electing landowner's property is not included in the proposed service area.  An applicant for a certificate of public convenience and necessity that has land removed from its proposed certificated service area because of a landowner's election under this subsection may not be required to provide service to the removed land for any reason, including the violation of law or utility commission or commission rules by the water or sewer system of another person.
    
    (i)  A landowner is not entitled to make an election under Subsection (h) but is entitled to contest the inclusion of the landowner's property in the proposed service area at a hearing held by the utility commission regarding the application if the proposed service area is located within the boundaries or extraterritorial jurisdiction of a municipality with a population of more than 500,000 and the municipality or a utility owned by the municipality is the applicant.
    
    (j)  This section does not apply to an application under Section [13.258](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=13.258) or a correction under Section [13.244](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=13.244)(e).

Except as provided by Section [13.2475](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=13.2475) or [13.255](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=13.255), a municipally owned or operated utility may not provide retail water and sewer utility service within the area certificated to another retail public utility without first having obtained from the utility commission a certificate of public convenience and necessity that includes the areas to be served.
    
    (b)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a retail public utility may continue and extend service within its area of public convenience and necessity and utilize the roads, streets, highways, alleys, and public property to furnish retail utility service, subject to the authority of the governing body of a municipality to require any retail public utility, at its own expense, to relocate its facilities to permit the widening or straightening of streets, by giving to the retail public utility 30 days' notice and specifying the new location for the facilities along the right-of-way of the street or streets.
    
    (c)  This section may not be construed as limiting the power of municipalities to incorporate or extend their boundaries by annexation, or as prohibiting any municipality from levying taxes and other special charges for the use of the streets as are authorized by Section [182.025](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=182.025), Tax Code.
    
    (d)  In addition to any other rights provided by law, a municipality with a population of more than 500,000 may exercise the power of eminent domain in the manner provided by Chapter [21](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=21), Property Code, to acquire a substandard water or sewer system if all the facilities of the system are located entirely within the municipality's boundaries.

    (1)  order any retail public utility that is required by law to possess a certificate of public convenience and necessity or any retail public utility that possesses a certificate of public convenience and necessity and is located in an affected county as defined in Section [16.341](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=16.341) to:
    
    (A)  provide specified improvements in its service in a defined area if service in that area is inadequate or is substantially inferior to service in a comparable area and it is reasonable to require the retail public utility to provide the improved service; or
    
    (B)  develop, implement, and follow financial, managerial, and technical practices that are acceptable to the utility commission to ensure that continuous and adequate service is provided to any areas currently certificated to the retail public utility if the retail public utility has not provided continuous and adequate service to any of those areas and, for a utility, to provide financial assurance of the utility's ability to operate the system in accordance with applicable laws and rules, in the form of a bond or other financial assurance in a form and amount specified by the utility commission;
    
    (2)  order two or more public utilities or water supply or sewer service corporations to establish specified facilities for interconnecting service;
    
    (3)  order a public utility or water supply or sewer service corporation that has not demonstrated that it can provide continuous and adequate service from its drinking water source or sewer treatment facility to obtain service sufficient to meet its obligation to provide continuous and adequate service on at least a wholesale basis from another consenting utility service provider; or
    
    (4)  issue an emergency order, with or without a hearing, under Section [13.041](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=13.041).
    
    (b)  If the utility commission has reason to believe that improvements and repairs to a water or sewer service system are necessary to enable a retail public utility to provide continuous and adequate service in any portion of its service area and the retail public utility has provided financial assurance under Section [341.0355](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=341.0355), Health and Safety Code, or under this chapter, the utility commission, after providing to the retail public utility notice and an opportunity to be heard by the commissioners at a meeting of the utility commission, may immediately order specified improvements and repairs to the water or sewer system, the costs of which may be paid by the bond or other financial assurance in an amount determined by the utility commission not to exceed the amount of the bond or financial assurance.  The order requiring the improvements may be an emergency order if it is issued after the retail public utility has had an opportunity to be heard at a meeting of the utility commission.  After notice and hearing, the utility commission may require a retail public utility to obligate additional money to replace the financial assurance used for the improvements.

    Sec. 13.254.  DECERTIFICATION INITIATED BY UTILITY COMMISSION OR UTILITY; EXPEDITED RELEASE INITIATED BY LANDOWNER.  (a)  The utility commission at any time after notice and hearing may revoke or amend any certificate of public convenience and necessity with the written consent of the certificate holder or if the utility commission finds that:
    
    (1)  the certificate holder has never provided, is no longer providing, is incapable of providing, or has failed to provide continuous and adequate service in the area, or part of the area, covered by the certificate;
    
    (2)  in an affected county as defined in Section [16.341](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=16.341), the cost of providing service by the certificate holder is so prohibitively expensive as to constitute denial of service, provided that, for commercial developments or for residential developments started after September 1, 1997, in an affected county as defined in Section [16.341](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=16.341), the fact that the cost of obtaining service from the currently certificated retail public utility makes the development economically unfeasible does not render such cost prohibitively expensive in the absence of other relevant factors;
    
    (3)  the certificate holder has agreed in writing to allow another retail public utility to provide service within its service area, except for an interim period, without amending its certificate; or
    
    (4)  the certificate holder has failed to file a cease and desist action pursuant to Section [13.252](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=13.252) within 180 days of the date that it became aware that another retail public utility was providing service within its service area, unless the certificate holder demonstrates good cause for its failure to file such action within the 180 days.
    
    (a-1)  As an alternative to decertification under Subsection (a), the owner of a tract of land that is at least 50 acres and that is not in a platted subdivision actually receiving water or sewer service may petition the utility commission under this subsection for expedited release of the area from a certificate of public convenience and necessity so that the area may receive service from another retail public utility.  The fact that a certificate holder is a borrower under a federal loan program is not a bar to a request under this subsection for the release of the petitioner's land and the receipt of services from an alternative provider.  On the day the petitioner submits the petition to the utility commission, the petitioner shall send, via certified mail, a copy of the petition to the certificate holder, who may submit information to the utility commission to controvert information submitted by the petitioner.  The petitioner must demonstrate that:
    
    (1)  a written request for service, other than a request for standard residential or commercial service, has been submitted to the certificate holder, identifying:
    
    (A)  the area for which service is sought;
    
    (B)  the timeframe within which service is needed for current and projected service demands in the area;
    
    (C)  the level and manner of service needed for current and projected service demands in the area;
    
    (D)  the approximate cost for the alternative provider to provide the service at the same level and manner that is requested from the certificate holder;
    
    (E)  the flow and pressure requirements and specific infrastructure needs, including line size and system capacity for the required level of fire protection requested; and
    
    (F)  any additional information requested by the certificate holder that is reasonably related to determination of the capacity or cost for providing the service;
    
    (2)  the certificate holder has been allowed at least 90 calendar days to review and respond to the written request and the information it contains;
    
    (3)  the certificate holder:
    
    (A)  has refused to provide the service;
    
    (B)  is not capable of providing the service on a continuous and adequate basis within the timeframe, at the level, at the approximate cost that the alternative provider is capable of providing for a comparable level of service, or in the manner reasonably needed or requested by current and projected service demands in the area; or
    
    (C)  conditions the provision of service on the payment of costs not properly allocable directly to the petitioner's service request, as determined by the utility commission; and
    
    (4)  the alternate retail public utility from which the petitioner will be requesting service possesses the financial, managerial, and technical capability to provide continuous and adequate service within the timeframe, at the level, at the cost, and in the manner reasonably needed or requested by current and projected service demands in the area.
    
    (a-2)  A landowner is not entitled to file a petition under Subsection (a-1) or Section [13.2541](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=13.2541) but is entitled to contest under Subsection (a) the involuntary certification of the landowner's property in a hearing held by the utility commission if the landowner's property is located:
    
    (1)  in the boundaries of any municipality or the extraterritorial jurisdiction of a municipality with a population of more than 500,000 and the municipality or retail public utility owned by the municipality is the holder of the certificate; or
    
    (2)  in a platted subdivision actually receiving water or sewer service.
    
    (a-3)  Within 60 calendar days from the date the utility commission determines the petition filed pursuant to Subsection (a-1) to be administratively complete, the utility commission shall grant the petition unless the utility commission makes an express finding that the petitioner failed to satisfy the elements required in Subsection (a-1) and supports its finding with separate findings and conclusions for each element based solely on the information provided by the petitioner and the certificate holder. The utility commission may grant or deny a petition subject to terms and conditions specifically related to the service request of the petitioner and all relevant information submitted by the petitioner and the certificate holder. In addition, the utility commission may require an award of compensation as otherwise provided by this section. If the utility commission requires an award of compensation, the utility commission shall require the petitioner to submit a report to the utility commission verifying for the purposes of Subsection (d) that the compensation has been paid to the decertified retail public utility.
    
    (a-4)  Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code, does not apply to any petition filed under Subsection (a-1).  The decision of the utility commission on the petition is final after any reconsideration authorized by the utility commission's rules and may not be appealed.
    
    (a-5)  Expired.
    
    (a-6)  Expired.
    
    (a-7)  The utility shall include with the statement of intent provided to each landowner or ratepayer a notice of:
    
    (1)  a proceeding under this section related to certification or decertification;
    
    (2)  the reason or reasons for the proposed rate change; and
    
    (3)  any bill payment assistance program available to low-income ratepayers.
    
    (a-8)  If a certificate holder has never made service available through planning, design, construction of facilities, or contractual obligations to serve the area a petitioner seeks to have released under Subsection (a-1), the utility commission is not required to find that the proposed alternative provider is capable of providing better service than the certificate holder, but only that the proposed alternative provider is capable of providing the requested service.
    
    (a-9)  Subsection (a-8) does not apply to a county that borders the United Mexican States and the Gulf of Mexico or a county adjacent to a county that borders the United Mexican States and the Gulf of Mexico.
    
    (a-10)  Subsection (a-8) does not apply to a county:
    
    (1)  with a population of more than 30,000 and less than 36,000 that borders the Red River; or
    
    (2)  with a population of more than 100,000 and less than 200,000 that borders a county described by Subdivision (1).
    
    (a-11)  Subsection (a-8) does not apply to a county:
    
    (1)  with a population of 170,000 or more that is adjacent to a county with a population of 1.5 million or more that is within 200 miles of an international border; or
    
    (2)  with a population of more than 40,000 and less than 50,000 that contains a portion of the San Antonio River.
    
    (b)  Upon written request from the certificate holder, the utility commission may cancel the certificate of a utility or water supply corporation authorized by rule to operate without a certificate of public convenience and necessity under Section [13.242](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=13.242)(c).
    
    (c)  If the certificate of any retail public utility is revoked or amended, the utility commission may require one or more retail public utilities with their consent to provide service in the area in question.  The order of the utility commission shall not be effective to transfer property.
    
    (d)  A retail public utility may not in any way render retail water or sewer service directly or indirectly to the public in an area that has been decertified under this section unless just and adequate compensation required under Subsection (g) has been paid to the decertified retail public utility.
    
    (e)  The determination of the monetary amount of compensation, if any, shall be determined at the time another retail public utility seeks to provide service in the previously decertified area and before service is actually provided.  The utility commission shall ensure that the monetary amount of compensation is determined not later than the 90th calendar day after the date on which a retail public utility notifies the utility commission of its intent to provide service to the decertified area.
    
    (f)  The monetary amount shall be determined by a qualified individual or firm serving as independent appraiser agreed upon by the decertified retail public utility and the retail public utility seeking to serve the area.  The determination of compensation by the independent appraiser shall be binding on the utility commission.  The costs of the independent appraiser shall be borne by the retail public utility seeking to serve the area.
    
    (g)  For the purpose of implementing this section, the value of real property owned and utilized by the retail public utility for its facilities shall be determined according to the standards set forth in Chapter [21](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=21), Property Code, governing actions in eminent domain and the value of personal property shall be determined according to the factors in this subsection.  The factors ensuring that the compensation to a retail public utility is just and adequate shall include:  the amount of the retail public utility's debt allocable for service to the area in question; the value of the service facilities of the retail public utility located within the area in question; the amount of any expenditures for planning, design, or construction of service facilities that are allocable to service to the area in question; the amount of the retail public utility's contractual obligations allocable to the area in question; any demonstrated impairment of service or increase of cost to consumers of the retail public utility remaining after the decertification; the impact on future revenues lost from existing customers; necessary and reasonable legal expenses and professional fees; and other relevant factors.  The utility commission shall adopt rules governing the evaluation of these factors.
    
    (g-1)  If the retail public utilities cannot agree on an independent appraiser within 10 calendar days after the date on which the retail public utility notifies the utility commission of its intent to provide service to the decertified area, each retail public utility shall engage its own appraiser at its own expense, and each appraisal shall be submitted to the utility commission within 60 calendar days.  After receiving the appraisals, the utility commission shall appoint a third appraiser who shall make a determination of the compensation within 30 days.  The determination may not be less than the lower appraisal or more than the higher appraisal.  Each retail public utility shall pay half the cost of the third appraisal.
    
    (h)  A certificate holder that has land removed from its certificated service area in accordance with this section may not be required, after the land is removed, to provide service to the removed land for any reason, including the violation of law or utility commission or commission rules by a water or sewer system of another person.

    Sec. 13.255.  SINGLE CERTIFICATION IN INCORPORATED OR ANNEXED AREAS.  (a)  In the event that an area is incorporated or annexed by a municipality, either before or after the effective date of this section, the municipality and a retail public utility that provides water or sewer service to all or part of the area pursuant to a certificate of convenience and necessity may agree in writing that all or part of the area may be served by a municipally owned utility, by a franchised utility, or by the retail public utility.  In this section, the phrase "franchised utility" shall mean a retail public utility that has been granted a franchise by a municipality to provide water or sewer service inside municipal boundaries.  The agreement may provide for single or dual certification of all or part of the area, for the purchase of facilities or property, and for such other or additional terms that the parties may agree on.  If a franchised utility is to serve the area, the franchised utility shall also be a party to the agreement.  The executed agreement shall be filed with the utility commission, and the utility commission, on receipt of the agreement, shall incorporate the terms of the agreement into the respective certificates of convenience and necessity of the parties to the agreement.
    
    (b)  If an agreement is not executed within 180 days after the municipality, in writing, notifies the retail public utility of its intent to provide service to the incorporated or annexed area, and if the municipality desires and intends to provide retail utility service to the area, the municipality, prior to providing service to the area, shall file an application with the utility commission to grant single certification to the municipally owned water or sewer utility or to a franchised utility.  If an application for single certification is filed, the utility commission shall fix a time and place for a hearing and give notice of the hearing to the municipality and franchised utility, if any, and notice of the application and hearing to the retail public utility.
    
    (b-1)  On the day a municipality submits an application for single certification to the utility commission under this section, the municipality shall send, via certified mail or hand delivery, a copy of the application to the retail public utility.
    
    (c)  The utility commission by order shall grant single certification to the municipality.  The utility commission shall also determine in its order the monetary amount that is adequate and just to compensate the retail public utility for any of the retail public utility's property the utility commission determines is being rendered useless or valueless by the single certification.  If the municipality in its application has requested the transfer of specified property of the retail public utility to the municipality or to a franchised utility, the utility commission shall also determine in its order the adequate and just compensation to be paid for such property pursuant to the provisions of this section, including an award for damages to property remaining in the ownership of the retail public utility after single certification.  The order of the utility commission shall not be effective to transfer property.  A transfer of property may be obtained under this section only by a court judgment rendered under Subsection (d) or (e).  The grant of single certification by the utility commission takes effect on the date the municipality or franchised utility, as the case may be, pays adequate and just compensation pursuant to court order, or pays an amount into the registry of the court or to the retail public utility under Subsection (f).  If the court judgment provides that the retail public utility is not entitled to any compensation, the grant of single certification takes effect when the court judgment becomes final.
    
    (c-1)  The utility commission by rule shall require the municipality or franchised utility to submit a report to the utility commission verifying that the municipality or franchised utility has paid all required adequate and just compensation to the retail public utility as provided by Subsection (c).
    
    (c-2)  The municipality or franchised utility must provide to each customer of the retail public utility being acquired an individual written notice within 60 days after the effective date for the transfer specified in the court judgment. The notice must clearly advise the customer of the identity of the new service provider, the reason for the transfer, the rates to be charged by the new service provider, and the effective date of those rates.
    
    (c-3)  Before filing an appeal under Subsection (e) and not later than the seventh day after the date the utility commission issues a final order under Subsection (c), the retail public utility may appeal the final order to the utility commission in a separate hearing before the utility commission.
    
    (d)  In the event the final order of the utility commission is not appealed within 30 days, the municipality may request the district court of Travis County to enter a judgment consistent with the order of the utility commission.  In such event, the court shall render a judgment that:
    
    (1)  transfers to the municipally owned utility or franchised utility title to property to be transferred to the municipally owned utility or franchised utility as delineated by the utility commission's final order and property determined by the utility commission to be rendered useless or valueless by the granting of single certification; and
    
    (2)  orders payment to the retail public utility of adequate and just compensation for the property as determined by the utility commission in its final order.
    
    (e)  Any party that is aggrieved by a final order of the utility commission under this section may file an appeal with the district court of Travis County within 30 days after the order becomes final.  The hearing in such an appeal before the district court shall be by trial de novo on all issues.  After the hearing, if the court determines that the municipally owned utility or franchised utility is entitled to single certification under the provisions of this section, the court shall enter a judgment that:
    
    (1)  transfers to the municipally owned utility or franchised utility title to property requested by the municipality to be transferred to the municipally owned utility or franchised utility and located within the singly certificated area and property determined by the court or jury to be rendered useless or valueless by the granting of single certification; and
    
    (2)  orders payment in accordance with Subsection (g) to the retail public utility of adequate and just compensation for the property transferred and for the property damaged as determined by the court or jury.
    
    (f)  Transfer of property shall be effective on the date the judgment becomes final.  However, after the judgment of the court is entered, the municipality or franchised utility may take possession of condemned property pending appeal if the municipality or franchised utility pays the retail public utility or pays into the registry of the court, subject to withdrawal by the retail public utility, the amount, if any, established in the court's judgment as just and adequate compensation.  To provide security in the event an appellate court, or the trial court in a new trial or on remand, awards compensation in excess of the original award, the municipality or franchised utility, as the case may be, shall deposit in the registry of the court an additional sum in the amount of the award, or a surety bond in the same amount issued by a surety company qualified to do business in this state, conditioned to secure the payment of an award of damages in excess of the original award of the trial court.  On application by the municipality or franchised utility, the court shall order that funds deposited in the registry of the court be deposited in an interest-bearing account, and that interest accruing prior to withdrawal of the award by the retail public utility be paid to the municipality or to the franchised utility.  In the event the municipally owned utility or franchised utility takes possession of property or provides utility service in the singly certificated area pending appeal, and a court in a final judgment in an appeal under this section holds that the grant of single certification was in error, the retail public utility is entitled to seek compensation for any damages sustained by it in accordance with Subsection (g) of this section.
    
    (g)  For the purpose of implementing this section, the value of real property owned and utilized by the retail public utility for its facilities shall be determined according to the standards set forth in Chapter [21](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=21), Property Code, governing actions in eminent domain;  the value of personal property shall be determined according to the factors in this subsection.  The factors ensuring that the compensation to a retail public utility is just and adequate, shall, at a minimum, include:  impact on the existing indebtedness of the retail public utility and its ability to repay that debt, the value of the service facilities of the retail public utility located within the area in question, the amount of any expenditures for planning, design, or construction of service facilities outside the incorporated or annexed area that are allocable to service to the area in question, the amount of the retail public utility's contractual obligations allocable to the area in question, any demonstrated impairment of service or increase of cost to consumers of the retail public utility remaining after the single certification, the impact on future revenues lost from existing customers, necessary and reasonable legal expenses and professional fees, factors relevant to maintaining the current financial integrity of the retail public utility, and other relevant factors.
    
    (g-1)  The utility commission shall adopt rules governing the evaluation of the factors to be considered in determining the monetary compensation under Subsection (g).  The utility commission by rule shall adopt procedures to ensure that the total compensation to be paid to a retail public utility under Subsection (g) is determined not later than the 90th calendar day after the date on which the utility commission determines that the municipality's application is administratively complete.
    
    (h)  A municipality or a franchised utility may dismiss an application for single certification without prejudice at any time before a judgment becomes final provided the municipality or the franchised public utility has not taken physical possession of property of the retail public utility or made payment for such right pursuant to Subsection (f) of this section.
    
    (i)  In the event that a municipality files an application for single certification on behalf of a franchised utility, the municipality shall be joined in such application by such franchised utility, and the franchised utility shall make all payments required in the court's judgment to adequately and justly compensate the retail public utility for any taking or damaging of property and for the transfer of property to such franchised utility.
    
    (j)  This section shall apply only in a case where:
    
    (1)  the retail public utility that is authorized to serve in the certificated area that is annexed or incorporated by the municipality is a nonprofit water supply or sewer service corporation, a special utility district under Chapter [65](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=65), Water Code, or a fresh water supply district under Chapter [53](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=53), Water Code;  or
    
    (2)  the retail public utility that is authorized to serve in the certificated area that is annexed or incorporated by the municipality is a retail public utility, other than a nonprofit water supply or sewer service corporation, and whose service area is located entirely within the boundaries of a municipality with a population of 1.7 million or more according to the most recent federal census.
    
    (k)  The following conditions apply when a municipality or franchised utility makes an application to acquire the service area or facilities of a retail public utility described in Subsection (j)(2):
    
    (1)  the utility commission or court must determine that the service provided by the retail public utility is substandard or its rates are unreasonable in view of the reasonable expenses of the utility;
    
    (2)  if the municipality abandons its application, the court or the utility commission is authorized to award to the retail public utility its reasonable expenses related to the proceeding hereunder, including attorney fees; and
    
    (3)  unless otherwise agreed by the retail public utility, the municipality must take the entire utility property of the retail public utility in a proceeding hereunder.
    
    (l)  For an area incorporated by a municipality, the compensation provided under Subsection (g) shall be determined by a qualified individual or firm to serve as independent appraiser, who shall be selected by the affected retail public utility, and the costs of the appraiser shall be paid by the municipality.  For an area annexed by a municipality, the compensation provided under Subsection (g) shall be determined by a qualified individual or firm to which the municipality and the retail public utility agree to serve as independent appraiser.  If the retail public utility and the municipality are unable to agree on a single individual or firm to serve as the independent appraiser before the 11th day after the date the retail public utility or municipality notifies the other party of the impasse, the retail public utility and municipality each shall appoint a qualified individual or firm to serve as independent appraiser.  On or before the 10th business day after the date of their appointment, the independent appraisers shall meet to reach an agreed determination of the amount of compensation.  If the appraisers are unable to agree on a determination before the 16th business day after the date of their first meeting under this subsection, the retail public utility or municipality may petition the utility commission or a person the utility commission designates for the purpose to appoint a third qualified independent appraiser to reconcile the appraisals of the two originally appointed appraisers.  The determination of the third appraiser may not be less than the lesser or more than the greater of the two original appraisals.  The costs of the independent appraisers for an annexed area shall be shared equally by the retail public utility and the municipality.  The determination of compensation under this subsection is binding on the utility commission.
    
    (m)  The utility commission shall deny an application for single certification by a municipality that fails to demonstrate compliance with the commission's minimum requirements for public drinking water systems.

    (c)  The utility commission shall require the retail public utility seeking to provide service to the decertified area to provide continuous and adequate service to the remaining customers at a cost comparable to the cost of that service to its other customers and shall establish the terms under which the service must be provided.  The terms may include:

    (b)  If a person proposes to sell or convey real property located in a certificated service area of a utility service provider, the person must give to the purchaser written notice as prescribed by this section.

    (d)  The notice must be executed by the seller and read as follows:  "The real property, described below, that you are about to purchase may be located in a certificated water or sewer service area, which is authorized by law to provide water or sewer service to the properties in the certificated area.  If your property is located in a certificated area there may be special costs or charges that you will be required to pay before you can receive water or sewer service.  There may be a period required to construct lines or other facilities necessary to provide water or sewer service to your property.  You are advised to determine if the property is in a certificated area and contact the utility service provider to determine the cost that you will be required to pay and the period, if any, that is required to provide water or sewer service to your property.

    "Except for notices included as an addendum to or paragraph of a purchase contract, the notice must be executed by the seller and purchaser, as indicated."
    
    (e)  The notice must be given to the prospective purchaser before the execution of a binding contract of purchase and sale.  The notice may be given separately or as an addendum to or paragraph of the contract.  If the seller fails to provide the notice required by this section, the purchaser may terminate the contract.  If the seller provides the notice at or before the closing of the purchase and sale contract and the purchaser elects to close even though the notice was not timely provided before the execution of the contract, it is conclusively presumed that the purchaser has waived all rights to terminate the contract and recover damages or pursue other remedies or rights under this section.  Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, a seller, title insurance company, real estate broker, or examining attorney, or an agent, representative, or person acting on behalf of the seller, company, broker, or attorney, is not liable for damages under Subsection (m) or (n) or liable for any other damages to any person for:
    
    (1)  failing to provide the notice required by this section to a purchaser before the execution of a binding contract of purchase and sale or at or before the closing of the purchase and sale contract if:
    
    (A)  the utility service provider did not file the map of the certificated service area in the real property records of the county in which the service area is located and with the utility commission depicting the boundaries of the service area of the utility service provider as shown in the real property records of the county in which the service area is located; and
    
    (B)  the utility commission did not maintain an accurate map of the certificated service area of the utility service provider as required by this chapter; or
    
    (2)  unintentionally providing a notice required by this section that is incorrect under the circumstances before the execution of a binding contract of purchase and sale or at or before the closing of the purchase and sale contract.
    
    (f)  The purchaser shall sign the notice or the purchase and sale contract that includes the notice to evidence the purchaser's receipt of the notice.
    
    (g)  At the closing of the purchase and sale contract, a separate copy of the notice with current information shall be executed by the seller and purchaser, acknowledged, and subsequently recorded in the real property records of the county in which the property is located.  In completing the notice to be executed by the seller and purchaser at the closing of the purchase and sale contract, any seller, title insurance company, real estate broker, or examining attorney, or any agent, representative, or person acting on behalf of the seller, company, broker, or attorney, may rely on the accuracy of the information required by this chapter that is last filed in the real property records by the utility service provider and the accuracy of the map of the certificated service area of the utility service provider.  Any information taken from the map is, for purposes of this section, conclusively presumed to be correct as a matter of law.  Any subsequent seller, purchaser, title insurance company, real estate broker, examining attorney, or lienholder may rely on the map of the certificated service area filed in the real property records by the utility service provider.
    
    (h)  In completing the notice required to be given to a prospective purchaser before the execution of a binding contract of purchase and sale, any seller, and any person completing the notice on behalf of the seller, may rely on the information contained in the map of the certificated service area filed in the real property records by the utility service provider.  Any subsequent seller, purchaser, title insurance company, real estate broker, examining attorney, or lienholder may rely on the map of the certificated service area filed in the real property records by the utility service provider.
    
    (i)  If the notice is given at closing as provided by Subsection (g), a purchaser, or the purchaser's heirs, successors, or assigns, may not maintain an action for damages or maintain an action against a seller, title insurance company, real estate broker, or lienholder, or any agent, representative, or person acting on behalf of the seller, company, broker, or lienholder, by reason of the seller's use of the information filed with the utility commission by the utility service provider or the seller's use of the map of the certificated service area of the utility service provider filed in the real property records to determine whether the property to be purchased is within the certificated service area of the utility service provider.  An action may not be maintained against a title insurance company for the failure to disclose that the described real property is included within the certificated service area of a utility service provider if the utility service provider did not file in the real property records or with the utility commission the map of the certificated service area.
    
    (j)  Any purchaser who purchases real property in a certificated service area of a utility service provider and who subsequently sells or conveys the property is conclusively considered on the closing of the subsequent sale to have waived any previous right to damages under this section.
    
    (k)  It is the express intent of this section that any seller, title insurance company, examining attorney, vendor of property and tax information, real estate broker, or lienholder, or any agent, representative, or person acting on behalf of the seller, company, attorney, vendor, broker, or lienholder, may rely for the purpose of completing the notice required by this section on the accuracy of the map of the certificated service area of the utility service provider filed in the real property records by the utility service provider.
    
    (l)  Except as otherwise provided by Subsection (e), if any sale or conveyance of real property within the certificated service area of a utility service provider fails to comply with this section, the purchaser may file a suit for damages under Subsection (m) or (n).
    
    (m)  If the sale or conveyance of real property fails to comply with this section, the purchaser may file a suit for damages in the amount of all costs related to the purchase of the property plus interest and reasonable attorney's fees.  The suit for damages may be filed jointly or severally against the individual or entity that sold or conveyed the property to the purchaser.  Following the recovery of damages under this subsection, the amount of the damages shall be paid first to satisfy all unpaid obligations on each outstanding lien on the property and the remainder of the damage amount shall be paid to the purchaser.  On payment of all damages respectively to each lienholder and the purchaser, the purchaser shall reconvey the property to the seller.
    
    (n)  If the sale or conveyance of the property fails to comply with this section, the purchaser may file a suit for damages in an amount not to exceed $5,000, plus reasonable attorney's fees.
    
    (o)  A purchaser may not recover damages under both Subsections (m) and (n).  An entry of a final decision awarding damages to the purchaser under either Subsection (m) or (n) precludes the purchaser from recovering damages under the other subsection.  Notwithstanding general or special law or the common law of this state to the contrary, the relief provided under Subsections (m) and (n) provides the exclusive remedy for a purchaser aggrieved by the seller's failure to comply with this section.  Any action for damages under this section does not apply to, affect, alter, or impair the validity of any existing vendor's lien, mechanic's lien, or deed of trust lien on the property.
    
    (p)  A suit for damages under this section must be filed by the earlier of:
    
    (1)  a date on or before the 90th day after the date the purchaser discovers:
    
    (A)  the cost the purchaser is required to pay to the utility service provider to obtain water or sewer service;  or
    
    (B)  the period required by the utility service provider to provide water or sewer service;  or
    
    (2)  the fourth anniversary of the date the property was sold or conveyed to the purchaser.
    
    (q)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the contrary, a purchaser may not recover damages under this section if the person:
    
    (1)  purchases an equity interest in real property and, in conjunction with the purchase, assumes any liens, including a purchase money lien;  and
    
    (2)  does not require proof of title by abstract, title insurance policy, or any other method.
    
    (r)  A utility service provider shall:
    
    (1)  record in the real property records of each county in which the service area or a portion of the service area is located a certified copy of the map of the certificate of public convenience and necessity and of any amendment to the certificate as contained in the utility commission's records, and a boundary description of the service area by:
    
    (A)  a metes and bounds survey certified by a licensed state land surveyor or a registered professional land surveyor;
    
    (B)  the Texas State Plane Coordinate System;
    
    (C)  verifiable landmarks, including a road, creek, or railroad line; or
    
    (D)  if a recorded plat of the area exists, lot and block number; and
    
    (2)  submit to the utility commission evidence of the recording.
    
    (s)  Each county shall accept and file in its real property records a utility service provider's map presented to the county clerk under this section if the map meets filing requirements, does not exceed 11 inches by 17 inches in size, and is accompanied by the appropriate fee.  The recording required by this section must be completed not later than the 31st day after the date a utility service provider receives a final order from the utility commission granting an application for a new certificate or for an amendment to a certificate that results in a change in the utility service provider's service area.

    Sec. 13.301.  REPORT OF SALE, MERGER, ETC.;  INVESTIGATION;  DISALLOWANCE OF TRANSACTION.  (a)  A utility or a water supply or sewer service corporation, on or before the 120th day before the effective date of a sale, acquisition, lease, or rental of a water or sewer system owned by an entity that is required by law to possess a certificate of public convenience and necessity or the effective date of a sale or acquisition of or merger or consolidation with such an entity, shall:
    
    (1)  file a written application with the utility commission; and
    
    (2)  unless public notice is waived by the utility commission for good cause shown, give public notice of the action.
    
    (b)  The utility commission may require that the person purchasing or acquiring the water or sewer system demonstrate adequate financial, managerial, and technical capability for providing continuous and adequate service to the requested area and any areas currently certificated to the person.
    
    (c)  If the person purchasing or acquiring the water or sewer system cannot demonstrate adequate financial capability, the utility commission may require that the person provide a bond or other financial assurance in a form and amount specified by the utility commission to ensure continuous and adequate utility service is provided.
    
    (d)  The utility commission shall, with or without a public hearing, investigate the sale, acquisition, lease, or rental to determine whether the transaction will serve the public interest.
    
    (e)  Before the expiration of the 120-day notification period, the utility commission shall notify all known parties to the transaction and the Office of Public Utility Counsel whether the utility commission will hold a  public hearing to determine if the transaction will serve the public interest.  The utility commission may hold a hearing if:
    
    (1)  the application filed with the utility commission or the public notice was improper;
    
    (2)  the person purchasing or acquiring the water or sewer system has not demonstrated adequate financial, managerial, and technical capability for providing continuous and adequate service to the service area being acquired and to any areas currently certificated to the person;
    
    (3)  the person or an affiliated interest of the person purchasing or acquiring the water or sewer system has a history of:
    
    (A)  noncompliance with the requirements of the utility commission, the commission, or the Department of State Health Services; or
    
    (B)  continuing mismanagement or misuse of revenues as a utility service provider;
    
    (4)  the person purchasing or acquiring the water or sewer system cannot demonstrate the financial ability to provide the necessary capital investment to ensure the provision of continuous and adequate service to the customers of the water or sewer system; or
    
    (5)  there are concerns that the transaction may not serve the public interest, after the application of the considerations provided by Section [13.246](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=13.246)(c) for determining whether to grant a certificate of convenience and necessity.
    
    (f)  Unless the utility commission holds a public hearing, the sale, acquisition, lease, or rental may be completed as proposed:
    
    (1)  at the end of the 120-day period; or
    
    (2)  at any time after the utility commission notifies the utility or water supply or sewer service corporation that a hearing will not be held.
    
    (g)  If the utility commission decides to hold a hearing or if the utility or water supply or sewer service corporation fails to make the application as required or to provide public notice, the sale, acquisition, lease, or rental may not be completed unless the utility commission determines that the proposed transaction serves the public interest.
    
    (h)  A sale, acquisition, lease, or rental of any water or sewer system owned by an entity required by law to possess a certificate of public convenience and necessity, or a sale or acquisition of or merger or consolidation with such an entity, that is not completed in accordance with the provisions of this section is void.  The utility commission shall approve a transaction to which this section applies without an owner's signature required by other law if the owner has abandoned operation of the facilities that are the subject of the transaction and cannot be located or does not respond to an application filed under Subsection (l).
    
    (i)  This section does not apply to:
    
    (1)  the purchase of replacement property;  or
    
    (2)  a transaction under Section [13.255](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=13.255) of this code.
    
    (j)  If a public utility facility or system is sold and the facility or system was partially or wholly constructed with customer contributions in aid of construction derived from specific surcharges approved by the regulatory authority over and above revenues required for normal operating expenses and return, the public utility may not sell or transfer any of its assets, its certificate of convenience and necessity, or its controlling interest in an incorporated utility, unless the utility provides to the purchaser or transferee before the date of the sale or transfer a written disclosure relating to the contributions.  The disclosure must contain, at a minimum, the total dollar amount of the contributions and a statement that the contributed property or capital may not be included in invested capital or allowed depreciation expense by the regulatory authority in rate-making proceedings.
    
    (k)  A utility or a water supply or sewer service corporation that proposes to sell, assign, lease, or rent its facilities shall notify the other party to the transaction of the requirements of this section before signing an agreement to sell, assign, lease, or rent its facilities.
    
    (l)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the utility commission by rule shall adopt an expedited process that allows a person appointed by the utility commission or commission under Section [13.4132](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=13.4132) as a temporary manager of a utility, utility in receivership, or utility in supervision, who is also an operator of a Class A or Class B utility to apply for utility commission approval of the person's acquisition of the stock, ownership interest, or assets of the temporarily managed and operated utility, utility in receivership, or utility in supervision, its facilities, and, if applicable, its certificated service area.  The expedited process must:
    
    (1)  waive public notice requirements regardless of whether the person elects to charge initial rates in accordance with Section [13.3011](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=13.3011) or use a voluntary valuation determined under Section [13.305](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=13.305);
    
    (2)  require approval of the acquisition transaction if the transaction is considered to be in the public interest; and
    
    (3)  provide that:
    
    (A)  the person's appointment is considered sufficient to demonstrate adequate financial, managerial, and technical capability for providing continuous and adequate service to the service area to be acquired and any areas currently certificated to the person; and
    
    (B)  all used and useful invested capital and just and reasonable operations and maintenance costs incurred by the person during the person's appointment as temporary manager and operator of the utility, utility in receivership, or utility in supervision to be acquired are considered to be a regulatory asset for the person and are recoverable in the person's next comprehensive rate proceeding or system improvement charge application.
    
    (m)  If a temporary rate under Section [13.046](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=13.046) is adopted during the period described by Subsection (l)(3)(B), all used and useful invested capital and just and reasonable operations and maintenance costs incurred by the person in excess of costs covered by the temporary rate are considered to be a regulatory asset for the person and are recoverable in the person's next comprehensive rate proceeding or system improvement charge application.
    
    (n)  The utility commission and commission shall provide a reasonable period for a person acquiring a utility under Subsection (l) to bring the acquired utility into compliance with utility commission and commission rules before imposing a penalty for any violation committed by the acquired utility for which no enforcement action has been completed at the time of acquisition.

    (4)  the three utility valuation experts selected under Subdivision (2) jointly shall retain a licensed engineer to conduct an assessment of the tangible assets of the selling utility, or the facilities to be sold, as applicable, and each utility valuation expert shall:
    
    (A)  incorporate the assessment into the appraisal under the cost approach required under Subdivision (3); and

    (2)  be or have been within the year preceding the date the service contract is executed an immediate family member of a director, officer, or employee of the acquiring utility or the selling utility.
    
    (e)  A fee paid to a utility valuation expert may be included in the transaction and closing costs associated with the acquisition by the acquiring utility.  A fee may not exceed the lesser of:
    
    (1)  five percent of the fair market value; or
    
    (2)  a fee amount approved by the utility commission.

    (1)  the ratemaking rate base of the selling utility as determined under Subsection (g); and
    
    (2)  any additional conditions for the acquisition the utility commission requires.

The penalty may be in an amount not to exceed $5,000 a day.  Each day a violation continues may be considered a separate violation.
    
    (b)  In determining the amount of the penalty, the utility commission or the commission shall consider:

The utility commission or the executive director shall base the recommended amount of the proposed penalty on the factors provided by Subsection (b), and shall analyze each factor for the benefit of the appropriate agency.
    
    (d)  Not later than the 10th day after the date on which the report is issued, the utility commission or the executive director of the commission shall give written notice of the report to the person, affiliated interest, or retail public utility charged with the violation.  The notice shall include a brief summary of the charges, a statement of the amount of the penalty recommended, and a statement of the right of the person, affiliated interest, or retail public utility charged to a hearing on the occurrence of the violation, the amount of the penalty, or both.
    
    (e)  Not later than the 20th day after the date on which notice is received, the person, affiliated interest, or retail public utility charged may give the appropriate agency written consent to the report described by Subsection (c), including the recommended penalty, or may make a written request for a hearing.
    
    (f)  If the person, affiliated interest, or retail public utility charged with the violation consents to the penalty recommended in the report described by Subsection (c) or fails to timely respond to the notice, the utility commission or the commission by order shall assess that penalty or order a hearing to be held on the findings and recommendations in the report.  If the utility commission or the commission assesses the penalty recommended by the report, the utility commission or the commission shall give written notice to the person, affiliated interest, or retail public utility charged of its decision.
    
    (g)  If the person, affiliated interest, or retail public utility charged requests or the utility commission or the commission orders a hearing, the appropriate agency shall call a hearing and give notice of the hearing.  As a result of the hearing, the appropriate agency by order may find that a violation has occurred and may assess a civil penalty, may find that a violation has occurred but that no penalty should be assessed, or may find that no violation has occurred.  All proceedings under this subsection are subject to Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code.  In making any penalty decision, the appropriate agency shall analyze each of the factors provided by Subsection (b).
    
    (h)  The utility commission or the commission shall give notice of its decision to the person, affiliated interest, or retail public utility charged, and if the appropriate agency finds that a violation has occurred and has assessed a penalty, that agency shall give written notice to the person, affiliated interest, or retail public utility charged of its findings, of the amount of the penalty, and of the person's, affiliated interest's, or retail public utility's right to judicial review of the agency's order.  If the utility commission or the commission is required to give notice of a penalty under this subsection or Subsection (f), the appropriate agency shall file notice of that agency's decision in the Texas Register not later than the 10th day after the date on which the decision is adopted.
    
    (i)  Within the 30-day period immediately following the day on which the utility commission's or commission's order is final, as provided by Subchapter [F](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001.141), Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code, the person, affiliated interest, or retail public utility charged with the penalty shall:
    
    (1)  pay the penalty in full; or
    
    (2)  if the person, affiliated interest, or retail public utility seeks judicial review of the fact of the violation, the amount of the penalty, or both:
    
    (A)  forward the amount of the penalty to the appropriate agency for placement in an escrow account; or
    
    (B)  post with the appropriate agency a supersedeas bond in a form approved by the agency for the amount of the penalty to be effective until all judicial review of the order or decision is final.
    
    (j)  Failure to forward the money to or to post the bond with the utility commission or the commission within the time provided by Subsection (i) constitutes a waiver of all legal rights to judicial review.  If the person, affiliated interest, or retail public utility charged fails to forward the money or post the bond as provided by Subsection (i), the appropriate agency or the executive director of that agency may forward the matter to the attorney general for enforcement.
    
    (k)  Judicial review of the order or decision of the utility commission or the commission assessing the penalty shall be under the substantial evidence rule and may be instituted by filing a petition with a district court in Travis County, as provided by Subchapter [G](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001.171), Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code.

    (m)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the utility commission or the commission may compromise, modify, extend the time for payment of, or remit, with or without condition, any penalty imposed under this section.
    
    (n)  Payment of a penalty under this section is full and complete satisfaction of the violation for which the penalty is assessed and precludes any other civil or criminal penalty for the same violation.

    (e)  The utility commission may authorize a building owner to use submetering equipment that relies on integrated radio based meter reading systems and remote registration in a building plumbing system using submeters that comply with nationally recognized plumbing standards and are as accurate as utility water meters in single application conditions.
    
    (f)  This section does not limit the authority of an owner, operator, or manager of an apartment house, manufactured home rental community, or multiple use facility to charge, bill for, or collect rent, an assessment, an administrative fee, a fee relating to the upkeep or management of chilled water, boiler, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, or other building system, or any other amount that is unrelated to utility costs.
