    SUBCHAPTER E. CERTIFICATES REPRESENTING OWNERSHIP INTEREST
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 3.201.  CERTIFICATED OR UNCERTIFICATED OWNERSHIP INTEREST;  APPLICABILITY.  (a)  Ownership interests in a domestic entity may be certificated or uncertificated.
    
    (b)  The ownership interests in a for-profit corporation, real estate investment trust, or professional corporation must be certificated, except to the extent a governing document of the entity or a resolution adopted by the governing authority of the entity provides that some or all of the classes or series of the ownership interests are uncertificated or that some or all of the ownership interests in any class or series of the ownership interests are uncertificated.  The entity may have outstanding both certificated and uncertificated ownership interests of the same class or series. If a domestic entity changes the form of its ownership interests from certificated to uncertificated, a certificated ownership interest subject to the change becomes an uncertificated ownership interest only after the certificate is surrendered to the domestic entity.
    
    (c)  Ownership interests in a domestic entity, other than a domestic entity described by Subsection (b), are uncertificated unless this code or the governing documents of the domestic entity state that the interests are certificated.
    
    (d)  Sections 3.202-3.205 do not apply to a partnership or a limited liability company except to the extent that the governing documents of the partnership or limited liability company specify.

    (1)  provide that an owner's ownership interest may be evidenced by a certificate of ownership interest issued by the entity;
    
    (2)  provide for the assignment or transfer of ownership interests represented by certificates;  and
    
    (3)  make other provisions with respect to the certificate.
