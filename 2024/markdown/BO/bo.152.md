    (c)  A charging order constitutes a lien on the judgment debtor's partnership interest.  The charging order lien may not be foreclosed on under this code or any other law.
    
    (d)  The entry of a charging order is the exclusive remedy by which a judgment creditor of a partner or of any other owner of a partnership interest may satisfy a judgment out of the judgment debtor's partnership interest.
    
    (e)  This section does not deprive a partner or other owner of a partnership interest of a right under exemption laws with respect to the judgment debtor's partnership interest.
    
    (f)  A creditor of a partner or of any other owner of a partnership interest does not have the right to obtain possession of, or otherwise exercise legal or equitable remedies with respect to, the property of the partnership.
