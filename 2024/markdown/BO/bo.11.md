The expiration of its period of duration does not by itself create a vested right on the part of an owner, member, or creditor of the entity to prevent the extension of that period.  An act undertaken or a contract entered into by the domestic entity during a period in which the entity could have extended its period of duration as provided by this subsection is not invalidated by the expiration of that period, regardless of whether the entity has taken any action to extend its period of duration.
    
    (c)  A domestic entity may not cancel an event requiring winding up specified in Section [11.051](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BO&Value=11.051)(3) and continue its business if the action is prohibited by the entity's governing documents or the title of this code governing the entity.
    
    (d)  A domestic entity may cancel an event requiring winding up specified in Section [11.051](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BO&Value=11.051)(4) and continue its business only if the action:
    
    (1)  is not prohibited by the entity's governing documents;  and
    
    (2)  is expressly authorized by the title of this code governing the entity.
    
    (e)  On cancellation of an event requiring winding up under this section, the domestic entity may continue its business.

In an action under this section, any limitation period provided by law is tolled in accordance with the discovery rule.  The secretary of state shall take any action necessary to implement an order under this section.
    
    (b)  If the termination of an entity's existence is revoked under Subsection (a):
    
    (1)  the revocation relates back to the effective date of the termination and takes effect as of that date; and
    
    (2)  the entity's status as an entity continues in effect as if the termination of the entity's existence had never occurred.
