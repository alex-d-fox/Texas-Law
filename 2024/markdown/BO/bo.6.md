    (b)  The owners or members or the governing authority of a filing entity, or a committee of the governing authority, may take action without holding a meeting, providing notice, or taking a vote if each person entitled to vote on the action signs a written consent or consents stating the action taken.  Except as provided by this section, the written consent or consents take effect when signed by all persons entitled to vote on the action.
    
    (b-1)  By a provision in the written consent or consents or by a written instruction to an agent of the filing entity by one or more persons granting the written consent or consents, a written consent or consents may be made to take effect at a future time, which must be not later than the 60th day after the date all persons entitled to vote on the action have signed the consent or consents.

    (b-2)  If two or more of the written consents described by Subsection (b-1) have different future effective times, the latest future effective time of those consents applies to all of the consents.  The written consent or consents are considered to have been given at the applicable effective time so long as all of the persons entitled to vote on the action, which is determined as of that effective time or, if applicable, the record date established under Section [6.102](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BO&Value=6.102), have:

    (b-3)  By a provision in the written consent or by a written instruction to an agent of the filing entity, a person signing a written consent may provide that the person's consent is to take effect at a future time, which must be not later than the 60th day after the date all persons entitled to vote on the action have signed the consent or consents.  The person's written consent is considered to have been given at the later of that future effective time or a later effective time determined under Subsection (b-1) or (b-2), so long as the person:
    
    (1)  is entitled to vote on the action subject to the consent, which is determined as of the applicable effective time or, if applicable, the record date established under Section [6.102](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BO&Value=6.102); and
    
    (2)  did not revoke the consent before the applicable effective time.
    
    (b-4)  A person signing a written consent may revoke the person's consent any time before the applicable effective time of the consent.

    Sec. 6.202.  ACTION BY LESS THAN UNANIMOUS WRITTEN CONSENT.  (a)  This section applies to any action required or authorized to be taken under this code or the governing documents of a filing entity at an annual or special meeting of the owners or members of the entity.
    
    (b)  Except as provided by this code, the certificate of formation of a filing entity may authorize the owners or members of the entity to take action without holding a meeting, providing prior notice, or taking a vote if owners or members of the entity having at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the action that is the subject of the consent at a meeting, in which each owner or member entitled to vote on the action is present and votes, sign a written consent or consents stating the action taken.
    
    (c)  A written consent or consents described by Subsection (b) must include:
    
    (1)  the date each owner or member signed the consent; and
    
    (2)  the date of signing of the latest dated consent satisfying the minimum number of owners or members necessary to approve the action that is the subject of the consent.
    
    (c-1)  The date described by Subsection (c)(2) must be not later than the 60th day after the date of the signing of the earliest dated consent of the owners or members signing the consent or consents.  If a consent does not contain the date that an owner or member signed the consent, the date that the owner or member signed the consent is considered to be the date that the consent is received by the filing entity.  A written consent or consents described by Subsection (b) that are not solicited by or on behalf of a filing entity or the filing entity's governing authority must be delivered to the entity as required by Section [6.203](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BO&Value=6.203) to take effect.
    
    (c-2)  By a provision in the written consent or consents or by a written instruction to an agent of the filing entity from one or more persons granting the written consent or consents, a written consent or consents described by Subsection (b) may be made to take effect at a future time, which must be not later than the 60th day after the date the last of the minimum number of owners or members necessary to sign the consent or consents as required by Subsection (b) have signed the consent or consents.  If the written consent or consents described by this subsection are to take effect at a future time, all of the written consent or consents take effect at that future effective time.
    
    (c-3)  If two or more of the written consents described by Subsection (c-2) have different future effective times, the latest future effective time of those consents applies to all of the consents.  The written consent or consents are considered to have been given for purposes of this section at the applicable effective time so long as owners or members satisfying the minimum requirements in Subsection (b):
    
    (1)  are determined to be owners or members, as applicable, as of:
    
    (A)  that effective time; or
    
    (B)  if applicable, the record date established under Section [6.102](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BO&Value=6.102); and
    
    (2)  have signed and not revoked the consent or consents at any time before the applicable effective time of the consent or consents.
    
    (c-4)  By a provision in the written consent or by a written instruction to an agent of the filing entity, an owner or member of a filing entity signing a written consent described by Subsection (b) may provide that the owner's or member's consent is to take effect at a future time, which must be not later than the 60th day after the date on which the consent is signed by the last of the minimum number of owners or members of the entity necessary to sign the consent or consents as required by Subsection (b).  The owner's or member's consent is considered to have been given for purposes of this section at the later of that future effective time or a later effective time determined under Subsection (c-3) so long as:
    
    (1)  the person is an owner or member, as applicable, as of:
    
    (A)  the applicable effective time; or
    
    (B)  if applicable, the record date established under Section [6.102](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BO&Value=6.102); and
    
    (2)  the owner or member did not revoke the consent at any time before the applicable effective time of the consent.
    
    (d)  The entity shall promptly notify each owner or member who did not sign a consent described by Subsection (b) of the action that is the subject of the consent.
    
    (e)  An owner or member of a filing entity signing a written consent may revoke the owner's or member's consent at any time before the applicable effective time of the consent.
    
    (f)  For purposes of this section, a "future time" includes a time that is determined on the happening of an event.

(a)  Except as provided by this code or the governing documents, any number of owners of a domestic entity, or any number of owners of the domestic entity and the domestic entity itself, may enter into a written voting agreement that is not set forth in the domestic entity's governing documents to provide the manner of voting of the ownership interests of the domestic entity.  A voting agreement entered into under this subsection is not part of the governing documents of the domestic entity.
    
    (b)  A copy of a voting agreement entered into under Subsection (a):

    (c-2)  A subsequent owner is considered to have notice of a voting agreement for purposes of Subsection (c-1)(1) if, at the time of transfer, the existence of the voting agreement is noted conspicuously on any certificate representing the ownership interest held by the transferor owner.  The notice described by this subsection is not the exclusive method by which notice of the voting agreement may be received by a subsequent owner for purposes of Subsection (c-1)(1).
    
    (c-3)  A voting agreement that becomes specifically enforceable against a subsequent owner under Subsection (c-1)(2) is specifically enforceable from the time the subsequent owner first receives notice or obtains actual knowledge of the voting agreement.
