    CHAPTER 252. UNINCORPORATED NONPROFIT ASSOCIATIONS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 252.001.  DEFINITIONS.  In this chapter:
    
    (1)  "Member" means a person who, under the rules or practices of a nonprofit association, may participate in the selection of persons authorized to manage the affairs of the nonprofit association or in the development of policy of the nonprofit association.
    
    (2)  "Nonprofit association" means an unincorporated organization, other than one created by a trust, consisting of three or more members joined by mutual consent for a common, nonprofit purpose.  A form of joint tenancy, tenancy in common, or tenancy by the entirety does not by itself establish a nonprofit association, regardless of whether the co-owners share use of the property for a nonprofit purpose.

    (1)  the name of the nonprofit association;

    (d)  A statement of authority must be executed in the same manner as a deed by a person who is not the person authorized to transfer the estate or interest.
    
    (e)  The county clerk may collect a fee for recording a statement of authority in the amount authorized for recording a transfer of real property.

    (c)  A tortious act or omission of a member or other person for which a nonprofit association is liable is not imputed to a person merely because the person is a member of the nonprofit association, is authorized to participate in the management of the affairs of the nonprofit association, or is a person considered as a member by the nonprofit association.
    
    (d)  A member of, or a person considered as a member by, a nonprofit association may assert a claim against the nonprofit association.  A nonprofit association may assert a claim against a member or a person considered as a member by the nonprofit association.
