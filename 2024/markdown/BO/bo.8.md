    (A)  is designated by a majority vote of the governing persons who at the time of the vote are disinterested and independent, regardless of whether the governing persons who are disinterested and independent constitute a quorum; and

    Sec. 8.151.  INSURANCE AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS.  (a)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, an enterprise may purchase or procure or establish and maintain insurance or another arrangement to indemnify or hold harmless an existing or former governing person, delegate, officer, employee, or agent against any liability:
    
    (1)  asserted against and incurred by the person in that capacity;  or
    
    (2)  arising out of the person's status in that capacity.
    
    (b)  The insurance or other arrangement established under Subsection (a) may insure or indemnify against the liability described by Subsection (a) without regard to whether the enterprise otherwise would have had the power to indemnify the person against that liability under this chapter.
    
    (c)  Insurance or another arrangement that involves self-insurance or an agreement to indemnify made with the enterprise or a person that is not regularly engaged in the business of providing insurance coverage may provide for payment of a liability with respect to which the enterprise does not otherwise have the power to provide indemnification only if the insurance or arrangement is approved by the owners or members of the enterprise.
    
    (c-1)  With respect to a limited partnership, a vote of a majority-in-interest of the limited partners constitutes approval of the owners for purposes of Subsection (c).
    
    (d)  For the benefit of persons to be indemnified by the enterprise, an enterprise may, in addition to purchasing or procuring or establishing and maintaining insurance or another arrangement:
    
    (1)  create a trust fund;
    
    (2)  establish any form of self-insurance, including a contract to indemnify;
    
    (3)  secure the enterprise's indemnity obligation by grant of a security interest or other lien on the assets of the enterprise;  or
    
    (4)  establish a letter of credit, guaranty, or surety arrangement.
    
    (e)  Insurance or another arrangement established under this section may be purchased or procured or established and maintained:
    
    (1)  within the enterprise;  or
    
    (2)  with any insurer or other person considered appropriate by the governing authority, regardless of whether all or part of the stock, securities, or other ownership interest in the insurer or other person is owned in whole or in part by the enterprise.
    
    (f)  The governing authority's decision as to the terms of the insurance or other arrangement and the selection of the insurer or other person participating in an arrangement is conclusive.  The insurance or arrangement is not voidable and does not subject the governing persons approving the insurance or arrangement to liability, on any ground, regardless of whether the governing persons participating in approving the insurance or other arrangement are beneficiaries of the insurance or arrangement.  This subsection does not apply in case of actual fraud.
