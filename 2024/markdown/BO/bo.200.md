    (1)  the restriction is reasonable and noted conspicuously on the certificate or other instrument representing the security;  or
    
    (2)  with respect to an uncertificated security, the restriction is reasonable and a notation of the restriction is contained in the notice sent with respect to the security under Section [3.205](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BO&Value=3.205).
