    Sec. 21.042.  ASSESSMENT OF DAMAGES.  (a)  The special commissioners shall assess damages in a condemnation proceeding according to the evidence presented at the hearing.
    
    (b)  If an entire tract or parcel of real property is condemned, the damage to the property owner is the local market value of the property at the time of the special commissioners' hearing.
    
    (c)  If a portion of a tract or parcel of real property is condemned, the special commissioners shall determine the damage to the property owner after estimating the extent of the injury and benefit to the property owner, including the effect of the condemnation on the value of the property owner's remaining property.
    
    (d)  In estimating injury or benefit under Subsection (c), the special commissioners shall consider an injury or benefit that is peculiar to the property owner and that relates to the property owner's ownership, use, or enjoyment of the particular parcel of real property, including a material impairment of direct access on or off the remaining property that affects the market value of the remaining property, but they may not consider an injury or benefit that the property owner experiences in common with the general community, including circuity of travel and diversion of traffic.  In this subsection, "direct access" means ingress and egress on or off a public road, street, or highway at a location where the remaining property adjoins that road, street, or highway.
    
    (e)  If a portion of a tract or parcel of real property is condemned for the use, construction, operation, or maintenance of the state highway system or of a county toll project described by Chapter [284](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=284), Transportation Code, that is eligible for designation as part of the state highway system, or for the use, construction, development, operation, or maintenance of an improvement or project by a metropolitan rapid transit authority created before January 1, 1980, with a principal municipality having a population of less than 1.9 million and established under Chapter [451](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=451), Transportation Code, the special commissioners shall determine the damage to the property owner regardless of whether the property owner makes a claim for damages to the remaining property.  In awarding compensation or assessing the damages, the special commissioners shall consider any special and direct benefits that arise from the highway improvement or the transit authority improvement or project that are peculiar to the property owner and that relate to the property owner's ownership, use, or enjoyment of the particular parcel of remaining real property.

    (2)  the number of years the political subdivision can reasonably be expected to produce groundwater from the property;

    (4)  the location of the real property in relation to the political subdivision for conveyance purposes;
    
    (5)  any potential environmental impact of producing groundwater from the real property;
    
    (6)  whether or not the real property is located within the boundaries of a political subdivision that can regulate the production of groundwater from the real property;

    (1)  authorize groundwater rights appraised separately from the real property under this section to be appraised separately from real property for property tax appraisal purposes;  or
    
    (2)  subject real property condemned for the purpose described by Subsection (a) to an additional tax as provided by Section [23.46](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=23.46) or [23.55](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=23.55), Tax Code.
