    Sec. 221.021.  REGISTRATION REQUIRED.  (a)  Except as provided by Subsection (b) or (d) of this section or another provision of this chapter, a person may not offer or dispose of a timeshare interest unless the timeshare plan is registered with the commission.
    
    (b)  Before a registration application for a timeshare plan is submitted or completed, a developer or any person acting on the developer's behalf may accept a reservation and a deposit from a prospective purchaser if the deposit is placed in a segregated escrow account with an independent escrow agent and if the deposit is fully refundable at any time at the request of the purchaser.  The deposit may not be forfeited unless the purchaser affirmatively creates a binding obligation by a subsequent written instrument.
    
    (c)  A developer or any person acting on the developer's behalf may not offer or dispose of a timeshare interest during any period within which there is in effect an order by the commission or by any court of competent jurisdiction revoking or suspending the registration of the timeshare plan of which such timeshare interest is a part.
    
    (d)  At the developer's request, the commission may authorize the developer to conduct presales before a timeshare plan is registered if the registration application is administratively complete, as determined by the commission or as established by commission rule.

    (2)  submit an administratively complete application for registration, including appropriate fees and exhibits required by the commission; and

    (e)  During the presales authorization period, the developer must:
    
    (1)  provide to each purchaser and prospective purchaser a copy of the proposed timeshare disclosure statement that the developer submitted to the commission with the initial registration application; and
    
    (2)  offer each purchaser the opportunity to cancel the purchase contract as provided by Section [221.041](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=221.041).
    
    (f)  After the final timeshare disclosure statement is approved by the commission, the developer must:
    
    (1)  give each purchaser and prospective purchaser a copy of the final timeshare disclosure statement; and
    
    (2)  if the commission determines that a materially adverse change exists between the disclosures contained in the proposed timeshare disclosure statement and the final timeshare disclosure statement, provide the purchaser a second opportunity to cancel the purchase contract as provided by Section [221.041](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=221.041).
    
    (g)  The requirements of this subchapter remain in effect during the period the developer offers or disposes of timeshare interests of the timeshare plan registered with the commission.  The developer must notify the commission in writing when all of the timeshare interests of a timeshare plan have been disposed of.

    SUBCHAPTER H. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 221.071.  DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES.  (a)  A developer or other person commits a false, misleading, or deceptive act or practice within the meaning of Subsections (a) and (b) of Section 17.46 of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act (Article [17.46](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=17.46) et seq., Business & Commerce Code), by engaging in any of the following acts:
    
    (1)  failing to disclose information concerning a timeshare interest required by Subchapter D;
    
    (2)  making false or misleading statements of fact concerning the characteristics of accommodations or amenities available to a consumer;
    
    (3)  predicting specific or immediate increases in the value of a timeshare interest without a reasonable basis for such predictions;
    
    (4)  making false or misleading statements of fact concerning the duration that accommodations or amenities will be available to a consumer;
    
    (5)  making false or misleading statements of fact concerning the conditions under which a purchaser of a timeshare interest may exchange the right to occupy a unit for the right to occupy a unit in the same or another timeshare property;
    
    (6)  representing that a prize, gift, or other benefit will be awarded in connection with a promotion with the intent not to award that prize, gift, or benefit in the manner represented;
    
    (7)  failing to provide a copy of the purchase contract to the purchaser at the time the contract is signed by the purchaser;
    
    (8)  failing to provide the annual statement as required by Section [221.074](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=221.074)(a); or
    
    (9)  exceeding a one-to-one purchaser-to-accommodation ratio for a timeshare plan during a consecutive 12-month period, as determined under Subsection (c).
    
    (b)  The provisions of this section are not exclusive and are in addition to provisions provided for in any other law.
    
    (c)  A developer complies with the one-to-one purchaser-to-accommodation ratio referred to in Subsection (a)(9) if the total number of purchasers eligible to use the accommodations of the timeshare plan during a consecutive 12-month period never exceeds the total number of accommodations available for use in the timeshare plan during that same period.  A purchaser-to-accommodation ratio is computed by dividing the number of purchasers eligible to use an accommodation in a timeshare plan on any given day by the number of accommodations within the plan available for use on that day.  For purposes of computing the purchaser-to-accommodation ratio:
    
    (1)  each purchaser is counted at least once each consecutive 12-month period;
    
    (2)  each accommodation is counted not more than 365 times each consecutive 12-month period, excluding a leap year, in which each accommodation may be counted 366 times; and
    
    (3)  a purchaser who is delinquent in paying timeshare assessments is considered eligible to use timeshare plan accommodations.
    
    (d)  If a developer has substantially complied with this chapter in good faith, a nonmaterial error or omission is not actionable.  Any nonmaterial error or omission is not sufficient to permit a purchaser to cancel a purchase contract after the period provided for cancellation expires under this chapter.
    
    (e)  A person, other than an owner of a timeshare interest who purchased the interest from a developer for the person's own personal use and occupancy, commits a false, misleading, or deceptive act or practice within the meaning of Sections [17.46](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=17.46)(a) and (b), Business & Commerce Code, and an unconscionable action or course of action as defined by Section [17.45](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=17.45), Business & Commerce Code, by knowingly participating, for consideration or with the expectation of consideration, in any plan or scheme a purpose of which is to transfer a timeshare interest to a transferee who does not have the ability, means, or intent to pay all assessments and taxes for the timeshare interest.  An association or other managing entity does not commit an act or action as described by this subsection by performing administrative acts and collecting fees or expenses as customary or required by law or under the project instruments in connection with a transfer by an owner of a timeshare interest in the timeshare property.

The developer may provide in the surrender instrument that, during the remaining period otherwise designated for developer control, specified actions of the association or board as described in the project instrument are effective only on approval of the developer.  The surrender instrument must be recorded in the real property records of the county in which the timeshare property is located.

A notice of a meeting may be included in a list of upcoming meetings sent to owners, and the list is not required to be specific to one meeting.  The failure of an owner to receive actual notice of a meeting of the owners does not affect the validity of any action taken at that meeting.
    
    (d)  Unless the project instrument provides otherwise, the association or managing entity must send notice of a board meeting held after the date the developer control period terminates to the mailing address of each owner on record with the association not later than the 10th day before the date of the meeting.  Notice to owners of a board meeting is not required if emergency circumstances require action by the board before notice can be given.  A notice of a board meeting must state the date, time, and place of the meeting.  A notice of a meeting may be included in a list of upcoming meetings sent to owners, and the list is not required to be specific to one meeting.  The failure of an owner to receive actual notice of a board meeting does not affect the validity of any action taken at that meeting.
    
    (e)  A notice may be provided in a newsletter or a similar mailing.  Notice may be provided by prepaid United States mail, e-mail for those owners who have provided an e-mail address, or any other reasonable method selected by the board.
    
    (f)  Notwithstanding Subsections (a)-(d) or any other law related to notice by an association, a notice to an owner may be provided by conspicuous disclosure on the association's website if the owner has consented to that alternative notice.  Consent to that alternative notice must be in writing and may be revoked by the owner at any time.
    
    (g)  An affidavit of notice by an officer of the association or the managing entity is prima facie evidence that notice was provided under this section.

(a)  The association or managing entity of the association must maintain among its records a complete and current list of the names and addresses of all owners of timeshare interests in the timeshare plan.  The association or managing entity must update this list not less than quarterly.

    (2)  as authorized or required by law.
    
    (c)  On the termination of the period of developer control under Section [221.083](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=221.083) and on the written request of an owner, the association or managing entity shall send by first class mail to owners on the list described by Subsection (a) any materials provided by any owner if the purpose of the mailing is for legitimate association business, including a proxy solicitation for the recall of a board member elected by the owners or the discharge of the managing entity.  The use of the solicited proxies must comply with the project instrument and this chapter.  Materials required to be provided under this subsection must be mailed not later than the 30th day after the date the request is received from an owner.
    
    (d)  The board or the managing entity is responsible for determining the appropriateness of a mailing requested under Subsection (c) and establishing reasonable procedures for exercising rights under this section.  The association or managing entity does not have an obligation to mail an item that the board or managing entity reasonably believes based on advice of legal counsel may be libelous or otherwise actionable.  An owner who requests the mailing of materials under Subsection (c) must reimburse the association or managing entity in advance for the actual costs of performing the mailing or a proportionate share of actual costs if the mailing is included in a mailing with other items.
    
    (e)  After the termination of the period of developer control under Section [221.083](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=221.083), it is a violation of this subchapter to refuse to mail material provided by a requesting owner who has complied with the reasonable procedures established by the board or managing entity, if:
    
    (1)  the sole purpose of the materials is to advance legitimate association business; and
    
    (2)  the requesting owner has:
    
    (A)  tendered to the association or managing entity payment of the cost under Subsection (d); or
    
    (B)  requested an invoice for that cost and has not received the invoice before the 10th day after the date the request was delivered to the association or managing entity.
    
    (f)  Except as otherwise authorized or required by law, the association or other managing entity may not furnish the name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address of any owner to any other owner or authorized agent of an owner unless the owner whose name, address, phone number, or e-mail address is requested first approves the disclosure in writing.
