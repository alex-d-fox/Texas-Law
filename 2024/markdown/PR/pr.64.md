    (3)  for notices to a tenant:

    SUBCHAPTER B.  ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 64.051.  SECURITY INSTRUMENT CREATES ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS; ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS CREATES SECURITY INTEREST.  (a)  An enforceable security instrument creates an assignment of rents arising from real property described in that security instrument, unless the security instrument provides otherwise or the security instrument is governed by Section [50](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=16.50)(a)(6), (7), or (8), Article XVI, Texas Constitution.
    
    (b)  An assignment of rents creates a presently effective security interest in all accrued and unaccrued rents arising from the real property described in the security instrument creating the assignment, regardless of whether the security instrument is in the form of an absolute assignment, an absolute assignment conditioned on default or other event, an assignment as additional security, or any other form.  The security interest in rents is separate and distinct from any security interest held by the assignee in the real property from which the rents arise.
    
    (c)  An assignment of rents does not reduce the secured obligation except to the extent the assignee collects rents and applies, or is obligated to apply, the collected rents to payment of the secured obligation.

    Sec. 64.052.  RECORDATION AND PERFECTION OF SECURITY INTEREST IN RENTS; PRIORITY OF INTERESTS IN RENTS.  (a)  A security instrument creating an assignment of rents may be recorded in the county in which any part of the real property is located in accordance with this code.
    
    (b)  On recordation of a security instrument creating an assignment of rents, the security interest in the rents is perfected.  This subsection prevails over a conflicting provision in the security instrument creating the assignment of rents or a law of this state other than this chapter that prohibits or defers enforcement of the security interest until the occurrence of a subsequent event, including a subsequent default of the assignor, the assignee's obtaining possession of the real property, or the appointment of a receiver.
    
    (c)  Except as provided by Subsection (d), a perfected security interest in rents has priority over the rights of a person who, after the security interest is perfected, acquires:
    
    (1)  a lien on or other security interest in the rents or the real property from which the rents arise; or
    
    (2)  an interest in the rents or the real property from which the rents arise.
    
    (d)  An assignee with a perfected security interest in rents has the same priority over the rights of a person described by Subsection (c) with respect to future advances as the assignee has with respect to the assignee's security interest in the real property from which the rents arise.

(a)  An assignee may enforce an assignment of rents using one or more of the methods provided by Section [64.054](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=64.054) or [64.055](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=64.055) or any other method sufficient to enforce an assignment of rents under a law of this state other than this chapter.
    
    (b)  On and after the date on which an assignee begins to enforce an assignment of rents, the assignee is entitled to collect all rents that:
    
    (1)  have accrued but remain unpaid on that date; and
    
    (2)  accrue on or after that date.

    Sec. 64.054.  ENFORCEMENT BY NOTICE TO ASSIGNOR.  (a)  After default, or as otherwise agreed by the assignor, the assignee may give the assignor a notice demanding that the assignor pay the assignee the proceeds of any rents that the assignee is entitled to collect under Section [64.053](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=64.053).
    
    (b)  For the purposes of Section [64.053](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=64.053), the assignee begins enforcement under this section on the date on which the assignee gives notice to the assignor in accordance with Section [64.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=64.002).

    Sec. 64.055.  ENFORCEMENT BY NOTICE TO TENANT.  (a)  After default, or as otherwise agreed by the assignor, the assignee may give to a tenant of real property that is subject to an assignment of rents a notice demanding that the tenant pay to the assignee all unpaid accrued rents and all unaccrued rents as they accrue.  The assignee shall give a copy of the notice to the assignor in accordance with Section [64.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=64.002).  The notice must substantially comply with the form prescribed by Section [64.056](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=64.056) and be signed by the assignee or the assignee's authorized agent or representative.

    (1)  the tenant is obligated to pay to the assignee all unpaid accrued rents and all unaccrued rents as they accrue, unless the tenant has previously received a notice under this section from another assignee of rents given by that assignee in accordance with this section and the other assignee has not canceled that notice;
    
    (2)  except as otherwise agreed in a document signed by the tenant, the tenant is not obligated to pay to an assignee rent that was prepaid to the assignor before the tenant received the notice under Subsection (a);
    
    (3)  unless the tenant occupies the premises as the tenant's primary residence, the tenant is not discharged from the obligation to pay rents to the assignee if the tenant pays rents to the assignor;
    
    (4)  the tenant's payment to the assignee of rents then due satisfies the tenant's obligation under the tenant's agreement with the assignor to the extent of the payment made; and
    
    (5)  the tenant's obligation to pay rents to the assignee continues until the earliest date on which the tenant receives:
    
    (A)  a court order directing the tenant to pay the rents in a different manner;
    
    (B)  a signed notice that a perfected security instrument that has priority over the assignee's security interest has been foreclosed; or

You may obtain additional information about the Assignment of Rents and the Assignee's right to enforce it at the address of the Assignee.
    
    2.  A default exists under the Assignment of Rents or related documents between the Landlord and the Assignee.  The Assignee is entitled to collect rents from the Premises.
    
    3.  This notice affects your rights and obligations under the agreement under which you occupy the Premises (your "Lease Agreement").  Unless you have otherwise agreed in a document signed by you, if your next scheduled rental payment is due within 30 days after you receive this notice, you will not be in default under your Lease Agreement for nonpayment of that rental payment until the 10th day after the due date of that payment or the 30th day following the date you receive this notice, whichever occurs first.

Any proceeds subsequently collected by the subordinate assignee shall be turned over to the assignee with priority not later than the 10th day after the date the proceeds are collected or as otherwise agreed between the assignee with priority and the subordinate assignee.
