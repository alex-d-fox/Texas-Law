    (e)  A hospital lien described by Section [55.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=55.002)(a) is not affected by a hospital's use of a method of classifying patients according to their ability to pay that is solely intended to obtain a lien for services provided to an indigent injured individual.
    
    (f)  An emergency medical services lien described by Section [55.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=55.002)(c) is for the amount charged by the emergency medical services provider, not to exceed $1,000, for emergency medical services provided to the injured individual during the 72 hours following the accident that caused the individual's injuries.

    (3)  charges by the emergency medical services provider for services provided if the injured individual has coverage under a private medical indemnity plan or program from which the provider is entitled to recover payment for the provider's services under an assignment of benefits or similar right.
    
    (h)  If the physician is employed in that capacity by an institution of higher education, as defined by Section [61.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=61.003), Education Code, and the lien does not include the amount of the physician's reasonable and necessary charges described by Subsection (c), the physician has a lien on the cause of action in the same manner as a hospital under this chapter.  The lien is subject to provisions of this chapter applicable to a hospital lien, and the physician or the physician's employing institution may secure and enforce the lien in the manner provided by this chapter.
