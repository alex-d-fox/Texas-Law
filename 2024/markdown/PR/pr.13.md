    CHAPTER 13. EFFECTS OF RECORDING
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 13.001.  VALIDITY OF UNRECORDED INSTRUMENT.  (a)  A conveyance of real property or an interest in real property or a mortgage or deed of trust is void as to a creditor or to a subsequent purchaser for a valuable consideration without notice unless the instrument has been acknowledged, sworn to, or proved and filed for record as required by law.
    
    (b)  The unrecorded instrument is binding on a party to the instrument, on the party's heirs, and on a subsequent purchaser who does not pay a valuable consideration or who has notice of the instrument.
    
    (c)  This section does not apply to a financing statement, a security agreement filed as a financing statement, or a continuation statement filed for record under the Business & Commerce Code.

    Sec. 13.002.  EFFECT OF RECORDED INSTRUMENT.  An instrument that is properly recorded in the proper county is:
    
    (1)  notice to all persons of the existence of the instrument;  and
    
    (2)  subject to inspection by the public.
    
    
    
    
    Acts 1983, 68th Leg., p. 3495, ch. 576, Sec. 1, eff. Jan. 1, 1984.  Amended by Acts 2003, 78th Leg., ch. 715, Sec. 2, eff. Sept. 1, 2003;  Acts 2003, 78th Leg., ch. 960, Sec. 2, eff. Sept. 1, 2003.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 13.003.  INSTRUMENTS PREVIOUSLY RECORDED IN OTHER COUNTIES.  The original or a certified copy of a conveyance, covenant, agreement, deed of trust, or mortgage, relating to land, that has been recorded in a county of this state other than the county where the land to which the instrument relates is located, is valid as to a creditor or a subsequent purchaser who has paid a valuable consideration and who does not have notice of the instrument only after it is recorded in the county in which the land is located.  Recording a previously recorded instrument in the proper county does not validate an invalid instrument.

    (b)  A transfer or encumbrance of real property involved in a proceeding by a party to the proceeding to a third party who has paid a valuable consideration and who does not have actual or constructive notice of the proceeding is effective, even though the judgment is against the party transferring or encumbering the property, unless a notice of the pendency of the proceeding has been recorded and indexed under that party's name as provided by Section [12.007](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=12.007)(c) in each county in which the property is located.
