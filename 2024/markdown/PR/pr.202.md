    (12)  a dedicatory instrument provision that regulates the location of the standby electric generator; or

    (g)  If a dedicatory instrument provision requires an owner to submit an application for approval of improvements located exterior to a residence, this section does not negate the requirement, but the information required to be submitted as part of the application for the installation of a standby electric generator may not be greater or more detailed than the application for any other improvement.
    
    (h)  In a hearing, action, or proceeding to determine whether a proposed or installed standby electric generator complies with the requirements of a dedicatory instrument provision permitted by Subsection (c), the party asserting noncompliance bears the burden of proof.
