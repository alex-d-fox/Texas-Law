    Sec. 52.0011.  ESTABLISHMENT OF LIEN PENDING APPEAL OF JUDGMENT.  (a)  A first or subsequent abstract of a judgment rendered by a court against a defendant, when it is recorded and indexed under this chapter, does not constitute a lien on the real property of the defendant if:
    
    (1)  the defendant has posted security as provided by law or is excused by law from posting security;  and
    
    (2)  the court finds that the creation of the lien would not substantially increase the degree to which a judgment creditor's recovery under the judgment would be secured when balanced against the costs to the defendant after the exhaustion of all appellate remedies.
