    (2)  the situs of administration of the trust is maintained or has been maintained at any time during the four-year period preceding the date the action is filed.
    
    (b-1)  If there are multiple trustees none of whom is a corporate trustee and the trustees maintain a principal office in this state, an action shall be brought in the county in which:
    
    (1)  the situs of administration of the trust is maintained or has been maintained at any time during the four-year period preceding the date the action is filed; or
    
    (2)  the trustees maintain the principal office.

    (1)  the situs of administration of the trust is maintained or has been maintained at any time during the four-year period preceding the date the action is filed; or
    
    (2)  any trustee resides or has resided at any time during the four-year period preceding the date the action is filed.

    (2)  any corporate trustee maintains its principal office in this state.

    (1)  in a county in which venue is proper under Subsection (b), (b-1), (b-2), or (c); or
    
    (2)  in the county in which the administration of the settlor's estate is pending.
    
    (d)  For just and reasonable cause, including the location of the records and the convenience of the parties and witnesses, the court may transfer an action from a county of proper venue under this section to another county of proper venue:
    
    (1)  on motion of a defendant or joined party, filed concurrently with or before the filing of the answer or other initial responsive pleading, and served in accordance with law;  or

    (3)  "Situs of administration" means the location in this state where the trustee maintains the office that is primarily responsible for dealing with the settlor and beneficiaries of the trust.
