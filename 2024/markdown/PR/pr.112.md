    SUBCHAPTER A. CREATION
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 112.001.  METHODS OF CREATING TRUST.  A trust may be created by:
    
    (1)  a property owner's declaration that the owner holds the property as trustee for another person;
    
    (2)  a property owner's inter vivos transfer of the property to another person as trustee for the transferor or a third person;

    (5)  a promise to another person whose rights under the promise are to be held in trust for a third person.

    (b)  Except as provided by Section [112.034](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=112.034), the fact that the person named as trustee is also a beneficiary does not disqualify the person from acting as trustee if he is otherwise qualified.

    Sec. 112.009.  ACCEPTANCE BY TRUSTEE.

    (b)  A person named as trustee who does not accept the trust incurs no liability with respect to the trust.
    
    (c)  If the person named as the original trustee does not accept the trust or if the person is dead or does not have capacity to act as trustee, the person named as the alternate trustee under the terms of the trust or the person selected as alternate trustee according to a method prescribed in the terms of the trust may accept the trust.  If a trustee is not named or if there is no alternate trustee designated or selected in the manner prescribed in the terms of the trust, the court shall appoint a trustee on a petition of any interested person.

    Sec. 112.033.  RESERVATION OF INTERESTS AND POWERS BY SETTLOR.  If during the life of the settlor an interest in a trust or the trust property is created in a beneficiary other than the settlor, the disposition is not invalid as an attempted testamentary disposition merely because the settlor reserves or retains, either in himself or another person who is not the trustee, any or all of the other interests in or powers over the trust or trust property, such as:
    
    (1)  a beneficial life interest for himself;

    Sec. 112.0335.  CONSTRUCTION OF CERTAIN TRUSTS.  (a)  Unless the terms of the trust provide otherwise, if a trust is created and amendable or revocable by the settlor, or by the settlor and the settlor's spouse, Chapter [255](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ES&Value=255), Estates Code, applies at the settlor's death to the construction and interpretation of at-death transfers as if the settlor of the trust is the testator, the beneficiaries of the at-death transfer are devisees, and the at-death transfers are devises.
    
    (b)  Section [355.109](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ES&Value=355.109), Estates Code, applies to the abatement of at-death transfers.

    Sec. 112.034.  MERGER.  (a)  If a settlor transfers both the legal title and all equitable interests in property to the same person or retains both the legal title and all equitable interests in property in himself as both the sole trustee and the sole beneficiary, a trust is not created and the transferee holds the property as his own.  This subtitle does not invalidate a trust account validly created and in effect under Chapter [113](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ES&Value=113), Estates Code.
    
    (b)  Except as provided by Subsection (c) of this section, a trust terminates if the legal title to the trust property and all equitable interests in the trust become united in one person.
    
    (c)  The title to trust property and all equitable interests in the trust property may not become united in a beneficiary, other than the settlor, whose interest is protected under a spendthrift trust, and in that case the court shall appoint a new trustee or cotrustee to administer the trust for the benefit of the beneficiary.

    Acts 2019, 86th Leg., R.S., Ch. 846 (H.B. [2780](http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/86R/billtext/html/HB02780F.HTM)), Sec. 13, eff. September 1, 2019.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 112.035.  SPENDTHRIFT TRUSTS.  (a)  A settlor may provide in the terms of the trust that the interest of a beneficiary in the income or in the principal or in both may not be voluntarily or involuntarily transferred before payment or delivery of the interest to the beneficiary by the trustee.
    
    (b)  A declaration in a trust instrument that the interest of a beneficiary shall be held subject to a "spendthrift trust" is sufficient to restrain voluntary or involuntary alienation of the interest by a beneficiary to the maximum extent permitted by this subtitle.
    
    (c)  A trust containing terms authorized under Subsection (a) or (b) of this section may be referred to as a spendthrift trust.
    
    (d)  If the settlor is also a beneficiary of the trust, a provision restraining the voluntary or involuntary transfer of the settlor's beneficial interest does not prevent the settlor's creditors from satisfying claims from the settlor's interest in the trust estate.  A settlor is not considered a beneficiary of a trust solely because:
    
    (1)  a trustee who is not the settlor is authorized under the trust instrument to pay or reimburse the settlor for, or pay directly to the taxing authorities, any tax on trust income or principal that is payable by the settlor under the law imposing the tax; or
    
    (2)  the settlor's interest in the trust was created by the exercise of a power of appointment by a third party.
    
    (e)  A beneficiary of the trust may not be considered a settlor merely because of a lapse, waiver, or release of:
    
    (1)  a power described by Subsection (f); or
    
    (2)  the beneficiary's right to withdraw a part of the trust property to the extent that the value of the property affected by the lapse, waiver, or release in any calendar year does not exceed the greater of:
    
    (A)  the amount specified in Section 2041(b)(2) or 2514(e), Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or
    
    (B)  the amount specified in Section 2503(b), Internal Revenue Code of 1986, with respect to the contributions by each donor.
    
    (f)  A beneficiary of the trust may not be considered to be a settlor, to have made a voluntary or involuntary transfer of the beneficiary's interest in the trust, or to have the power to make a voluntary or involuntary transfer of the beneficiary's interest in the trust, merely because the beneficiary, in any capacity, holds or exercises:
    
    (1)  a presently exercisable power to:
    
    (A)  consume, invade, appropriate, or distribute property to or for the benefit of the beneficiary, if the power is:
    
    (i)  exercisable only on consent of another person holding an interest adverse to the beneficiary's interest; or
    
    (ii)  limited by an ascertainable standard, including health, education, support, or maintenance of the beneficiary; or
    
    (B)  appoint any property of the trust to or for the benefit of a person other than the beneficiary, a creditor of the beneficiary, the beneficiary's estate, or a creditor of the beneficiary's estate;
    
    (2)  a testamentary power of appointment; or
    
    (3)  a presently exercisable right described by Subsection (e)(2).
    
    (f-1)  A beneficiary of the trust or the estate of a beneficiary of the trust may not be considered to be a settlor merely because the beneficiary, in any capacity:
    
    (1)  held or exercised a testamentary power of appointment other than a general power of appointment;
    
    (2)  held a testamentary general power of appointment; or
    
    (3)  exercised a testamentary general power of appointment in favor of or for the benefit of the takers in default of the appointive assets.
    
    (f-2)  If a beneficiary of the trust exercised a testamentary general power of appointment in favor of or for the benefit of any appointee other than the takers in default of the appointive assets, the appointive assets are:
    
    (1)  subject to the claims of creditors of the beneficiary, but only to the extent the beneficiary's own property is insufficient to meet the beneficiary's debts; and
    
    (2)  unless appointed to the beneficiary's estate, not subject to:
    
    (A)  administration as a part of the beneficiary's estate;
    
    (B)  recovery by the personal representative of the beneficiary's estate, except as provided by Section 2207B, Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or
    
    (C)  the payment of taxes or administration expenses of the beneficiary's estate.
    
    (f-3)  For the purposes of Subsections (f-1) and (f-2), "general power of appointment" has the meaning assigned by Section 2041(b)(1), Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
    
    (g)  For the purposes of this section, property contributed to the following trusts is not considered to have been contributed by the settlor, and a person who would otherwise be treated as a settlor or a deemed settlor of the following trusts may not be treated as a settlor:
    
    (1)  an irrevocable inter vivos marital trust if:
    
    (A)  the settlor is a beneficiary of the trust after the death of the settlor's spouse; and
    
    (B)  the trust is treated as:
    
    (i)  qualified terminable interest property under Section 2523(f), Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or
    
    (ii)  a general power of appointment trust under Section 2523(e), Internal Revenue Code of 1986;
    
    (2)  an irrevocable inter vivos trust for the settlor's spouse if the settlor is a beneficiary of the trust after the death of the settlor's spouse; or
    
    (3)  an irrevocable trust for the benefit of a person:
    
    (A)  if the settlor is the person's spouse, regardless of whether or when the person was the settlor of an irrevocable trust for the benefit of that spouse; or
    
    (B)  to the extent that the property of the trust was subject to a general power of appointment in another person.
    
    (h)  For the purposes of Subsection (g), a person is a beneficiary whether named a beneficiary:
    
    (1)  under the initial trust instrument; or
    
    (2)  through the exercise of a limited or general power of appointment by:
    
    (A)  that person's spouse; or
    
    (B)  another person.

    Sec. 112.036.  RULE AGAINST PERPETUITIES.  (a)  The rule against perpetuities applies to an interest in a trust other than a charitable trust.
    
    (b)  For purposes of this section, the effective date is the date the governing instrument creating an interest in the trust becomes irrevocable with respect to that interest. If an interest in one trust is distributed to another trust with a different effective date, the effective date of that interest in the second trust becomes the earlier of the effective dates of the two trusts.
    
    (c)  An interest in a trust must vest, if at all:
    
    (1)  if the effective date is on or after September 1, 2021, not later than the later of:
    
    (A)  300 years after the effective date; or
    
    (B)  21 years after some life in being at the time of the effective date, plus a period of gestation; or
    
    (2)  if the effective date is before September 1, 2021, except as provided by Subsection (d), not later than 21 years after some life in being at the time of the effective date, plus a period of gestation.
    
    (d)  An interest in a trust that has an effective date before September 1, 2021, may vest as described by Subsection (c)(1) if the trust instrument provides that an interest in the trust vests under the provisions of this section applicable to trusts on the date that the interest vests.
    
    (e)  Any interest in a trust may be reformed or construed to the extent and as provided by Section [5.043](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=5.043).
    
    (f)  Under this section, a settlor of a trust may not direct that a real property asset be retained or refuse that a real property asset may be sold for a period longer than 100 years.

    Sec. 112.037.  TRUST FOR CARE OF ANIMAL.  (a)  A trust may be created to provide for the care of an animal alive during the settlor's lifetime.  The trust terminates on the death of the animal or, if the trust is created to provide for the care of more than one animal alive during the settlor's lifetime, on the death of the last surviving animal.
    
    (b)  A trust authorized by this section may be enforced by a person appointed in the terms of the trust or, if a person is not appointed in the terms of the trust, by a person appointed by the court.  A person having an interest in the welfare of an animal that is the subject of a trust authorized by this section may request the court to appoint a person to enforce the trust or to remove a person appointed to enforce the trust.

    (e)  Except as otherwise provided by the terms of the trust, property not required for the trust's intended use must be distributed to:
    
    (1)  if the settlor is living at the time the trust property is distributed, the settlor; or
    
    (2)  if the settlor is not living at the time the trust property is distributed:
    
    (A)  if the settlor has a will, beneficiaries under the settlor's will; or
    
    (B)  in the absence of an effective provision in a will, the settlor's heirs.
    
    (f)  For purposes of Section [112.036](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=112.036), the lives in being used to determine the maximum duration of a trust authorized by this section are:
    
    (1)  the individual beneficiaries of the trust;
    
    (2)  the individuals named in the instrument creating the trust; and
    
    (3)  if the settlor or settlors are living at the time the trust becomes irrevocable, the settlor or settlors of the trust or, if the settlor or settlors are not living at the time the trust becomes irrevocable, the individuals who would inherit the settlor or settlors' property under the law of this state had the settlor or settlors died intestate at the time the trust becomes irrevocable.

    Sec. 112.038.  FORFEITURE CLAUSE.  (a)  A provision in a trust that would cause a forfeiture of or void an interest for bringing any court action, including contesting a trust, is enforceable unless in a court action determining whether the forfeiture clause should be enforced, the person who brought the action contrary to the forfeiture clause establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that:
    
    (1)  just cause existed for bringing the action; and
    
    (2)  the action was brought and maintained in good faith.
    
    (b)  This section is not intended to and does not repeal any law, recognizing that forfeiture clauses generally will not be construed to prevent a beneficiary from seeking to compel a fiduciary to perform the fiduciary's duties, seeking redress against a fiduciary for a breach of the fiduciary's duties, or seeking a judicial construction of a will or trust.

    Sec. 112.052.  TERMINATION.  A trust terminates if by its terms the trust is to continue only until the expiration of a certain period or until the happening of a certain event and the period of time has elapsed or the event has occurred.  If an event of termination occurs, the trustee may continue to exercise the powers of the trustee for the reasonable period of time required to wind up the affairs of the trust and to make distribution of its assets to the appropriate beneficiaries.  The continued exercise of the trustee's powers after an event of termination does not affect the vested rights of beneficiaries of the trust.

    Sec. 112.054.  JUDICIAL MODIFICATION, REFORMATION, OR TERMINATION OF TRUSTS.  (a)  On the petition of a trustee or a beneficiary, a court may order that the trustee be changed, that the terms of the trust be modified, that the trustee be directed or permitted to do acts that are not authorized or that are forbidden by the terms of the trust, that the trustee be prohibited from performing acts required by the terms of the trust, or that the trust be terminated in whole or in part, if:
    
    (1)  the purposes of the trust have been fulfilled or have become illegal or impossible to fulfill;
    
    (2)  because of circumstances not known to or anticipated by the settlor, the order will further the purposes of the trust;
    
    (3)  modification of administrative, nondispositive terms of the trust is necessary or appropriate to prevent waste or impairment of the trust's administration;
    
    (4)  the order is necessary or appropriate to achieve the settlor's tax objectives or to qualify a distributee for governmental benefits and is not contrary to the settlor's intentions; or
    
    (5)  subject to Subsection (d):
    
    (A)  continuance of the trust is not necessary to achieve any material purpose of the trust; or
    
    (B)  the order is not inconsistent with a material purpose of the trust.
    
    (b)  The court shall exercise its discretion to order a modification or termination under Subsection (a) or reformation under Subsection (b-1) in the manner that conforms as nearly as possible to the probable intention of the settlor.  The court shall consider spendthrift provisions as a factor in making its decision whether to modify, terminate, or reform, but the court is not precluded from exercising its discretion to modify, terminate, or reform solely because the trust is a spendthrift trust.
    
    (b-1)  On the petition of a trustee or a beneficiary, a court may order that the terms of the trust be reformed if:
    
    (1)  reformation of administrative, nondispositive terms of the trust is necessary or appropriate to prevent waste or impairment of the trust's administration;
    
    (2)  reformation is necessary or appropriate to achieve the settlor's tax objectives or to qualify a distributee for governmental benefits and is not contrary to the settlor's intentions; or
    
    (3)  reformation is necessary to correct a scrivener's error in the governing document, even if unambiguous, to conform the terms to the settlor's intent.
    
    (c)  The court may direct that an order described by Subsection (a)(4) has retroactive effect.  The reformation of a trust under an order described by Subsection (b-1) is effective as of the creation of the trust.
    
    (d)  The court may not take the action permitted by Subsection (a)(5) unless all beneficiaries of the trust have consented to the order or are deemed to have consented to the order.  A minor, incapacitated, unborn, or unascertained beneficiary is deemed to have consented if a person representing the beneficiary's interest under Section [115.013](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=115.013)(c) has consented or if a guardian ad litem appointed to represent the beneficiary's interest under Section [115.014](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=115.014) consents on the beneficiary's behalf.
    
    (e)  An order described by Subsection (b-1)(3) may be issued only if the settlor's intent is established by clear and convincing evidence.
    
    (f)  Subsection (b-1) is not intended to state the exclusive basis for reformation of trusts, and the bases for reformation of trusts in equity or common law are not affected by this section.

    (4)  may not make an investment that would subject it to tax under Section 4944, Internal Revenue Code;  and
    
    (5)  may not make a taxable expenditure that would subject it to tax under Section 4945, Internal Revenue Code.
    
    (b)  If a trust was created before January 1, 1970, this section applies to it only for its taxable years that begin on or after January 1, 1972.

    Sec. 112.057.  DIVISION AND COMBINATION OF TRUSTS.  (a)  The trustee may, unless expressly prohibited by the terms of the instrument establishing the trust, divide a trust into two or more separate trusts without a judicial proceeding if the result does not impair the rights of any beneficiary or adversely affect achievement of the purposes of the original trust.  The trustee may make a division under this subsection by:
    
    (1)  giving written notice of the division, not later than the 30th day before the date of a division under this subsection, to each beneficiary who might then be entitled to receive distributions from the trust or may be entitled to receive distributions from the trust once it is funded;  and

    (c)  The trustee may, unless expressly prohibited by the terms of the instrument establishing a trust, combine two or more trusts into a single trust without a judicial proceeding if the result does not impair the rights of any beneficiary or adversely affect achievement of the purposes of one of the separate trusts.

    (1)  giving a written notice of the combination, not later than the 30th day before the effective date of the combination, to each beneficiary who might then be entitled to receive distributions from the separate trusts being combined or to each beneficiary who might be entitled to receive distributions from the separate trusts once the trusts are funded; and
