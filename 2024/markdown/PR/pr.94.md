    (b)  A landlord is liable to a tenant as provided by this subchapter if:
    
    (1)  the tenant has given the landlord notice to repair or remedy a condition by giving that notice to the person to whom or to the place where the tenant's rent is normally paid;
    
    (2)  the condition materially affects the physical health or safety of an ordinary tenant;
    
    (3)  the tenant has given the landlord a subsequent written notice to repair or remedy the condition after a reasonable time to repair or remedy the condition following the notice given under Subdivision (1) or the tenant has given the notice under Subdivision (1) by sending that notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by registered mail;
    
    (4)  the landlord has had a reasonable time to repair or remedy the condition after the landlord received the tenant's notice under Subdivision (1) and, if applicable, the tenant's subsequent notice under Subdivision (3);
    
    (5)  the landlord has not made a diligent effort to repair or remedy the condition after the landlord received the tenant's notice under Subdivision (1) and, if applicable, the tenant's notice under Subdivision (3);  and
    
    (6)  the tenant was not delinquent in the payment of rent at the time any notice required by this subsection was given.

    (d)  For purposes of Subsection (b)(3) or (4), in determining whether a period of time is a reasonable time to repair or remedy a condition, there is a rebuttable presumption that seven days is a reasonable time.  To rebut that presumption, the date on which the landlord received the tenant's notice, the severity and nature of the condition, and the reasonable availability of materials and labor and of utilities from a utility company must be considered.
    
    (e)  Except as provided by Subsection (f), a tenant to whom a landlord is liable under Subsection (b) may:

    (1)  entitled to a pro rata refund of rent from the date of termination or the date the tenant moves out, whichever is later;
    
    (2)  entitled to deduct the tenant's security deposit from the tenant's rent without necessity of lawsuit or to obtain a refund of the tenant's security deposit according to law;  and
    
    (3)  not entitled to the other repair and deduct remedies under Section [94.157](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=94.157) or the judicial remedies under Sections [94.159](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=94.159)(a)(1) and (2).

    Sec. 94.157.  TENANT'S REPAIR AND DEDUCT REMEDIES.  (a)  If the landlord is liable to the tenant under Section [94.156](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=94.156)(b), the tenant may have the condition repaired or remedied and may deduct the cost from a subsequent rent payment as provided by this section.
    
    (b)  Except as provided by this subsection, the tenant's deduction for the cost of the repair or remedy may not exceed the amount of one month's rent under the lease agreement or $500, whichever is greater.  If the tenant's rent is subsidized in whole or in part by a governmental agency, the deduction limitation of one month's rent means the fair market rent for the manufactured home lot and not the rent that the tenant pays.  The governmental agency subsidizing the rent shall determine the fair market rent.  If the governmental agency does not make a determination, the fair market rent means a reasonable amount of rent under the circumstances.
    
    (c)  Repairs and deductions under this section may be made as often as necessary provided that the total repairs and deductions in any one month may not exceed one month's rent or $500, whichever is greater.

    (2)  the tenant has given notice to the landlord in the same manner as prescribed by Section [92.056](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=92.056)(b)(1) and, if required under Section [92.056](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=92.056)(b)(3), a subsequent notice in the same manner as prescribed by that subsection;  and
    
    (3)  any one of the following events has occurred:
    
    (A)  the landlord has failed to remedy the backup or overflow of raw sewage inside the tenant's manufactured home that results from a condition in the utility lines installed in the manufactured home community by the landlord;
    
    (B)  the landlord has expressly or impliedly agreed in the lease agreement to furnish potable water to the tenant's manufactured home lot and the water service to the lot has totally ceased;  or
    
    (C)  the landlord has been notified in writing by the appropriate local housing, building, or health official or other official having jurisdiction that a condition existing on the manufactured home lot materially affects the health or safety of an ordinary tenant.
    
    (e)  At least one of the notices given under Subsection (d)(2) must state that the tenant intends to repair or remedy the condition.  The notice must also contain a reasonable description of the intended repair or remedy.
    
    (f)  If the requirements prescribed by Subsections (d) and (e) are met, a tenant may:
    
    (1)  have the condition repaired or remedied immediately following the tenant's notice of intent to repair if the condition involves the backup or overflow of sewage;
    
    (2)  have the condition repaired or remedied if the condition involves a cessation of potable water if the landlord has failed to repair or remedy the condition before the fourth day after the date the tenant delivers a notice of intent to repair;  or
    
    (3)  have the condition repaired or remedied if the condition is not covered by Subsection (d)(3)(A) or (B) and involves a condition affecting the physical health or safety of the ordinary tenant if the landlord has failed to repair or remedy the condition before the eighth day after the date the tenant delivers a notice of intent to repair.
    
    (g)  Repairs made based on a tenant's notice must be made by a company, contractor, or repairman listed at the time of the tenant's notice of intent to repair in the yellow or business pages of the telephone directory or in the classified advertising section of a newspaper of the municipality or county in which the manufactured home community is located or in an adjacent county.  Unless the landlord and tenant agree otherwise under Subsection (i), repairs may not be made by the tenant, the tenant's immediate family, the tenant's employer or employees, or a company in which the tenant has an ownership interest.  Repairs may not be made to the foundation or load-bearing structural elements of the manufactured home lot.
    
    (h)  Repairs made based on a tenant's notice must comply with applicable building codes, including any required building permit.
    
    (i)  A landlord and a tenant may mutually agree for the tenant to repair or remedy, at the landlord's expense, any condition on the manufactured home lot regardless of whether it materially affects the health or safety of an ordinary tenant.
    
    (j)  The tenant may not contract for labor or materials in excess of the amount the tenant may deduct under this section.  The landlord is not liable to repairmen, contractors, or material suppliers who furnish labor or materials to repair or remedy the condition.  A repairman or supplier does not have a lien for materials or services arising out of repairs contracted for by the tenant under this section.
    
    (k)  When deducting the cost of repairs from the rent payment, the tenant shall furnish the landlord, along with payment of the balance of the rent, a copy of the repair bill and the receipt for its payment.  A repair bill and receipt may be the same document.
    
    (l)  If the landlord repairs or remedies the condition after the tenant has contacted a repairman but before the repairman commences work, the landlord is liable for the cost incurred by the tenant for the repairman's charge for traveling to the premises, and the tenant may deduct the charge from the tenant's rent as if it were a repair cost.

    Sec. 94.158.  LANDLORD AFFIDAVIT FOR DELAY.  (a)  The tenant must delay contracting for repairs under Section [94.157](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=94.157) if, before the tenant contracts for the repairs, the landlord delivers to the tenant an affidavit signed and sworn to under oath by the landlord or the landlord's authorized agent and complying with this section.
    
    (b)  The affidavit must summarize the reasons for the delay and the diligent efforts made by the landlord up to the date of the affidavit to get the repairs done.  The affidavit must state facts showing that the landlord has made and is making diligent efforts to repair the condition, and it must contain dates, names, addresses, and telephone numbers of contractors, suppliers, and repairers contacted by the owner.
    
    (c)  Affidavits under this section may delay repair by the tenant for:
    
    (1)  15 days if the landlord's failure to repair is caused by a delay in obtaining necessary parts for which the landlord is not at fault;  or
    
    (2)  30 days if the landlord's failure to repair is caused by a general shortage of labor or materials for repair following a natural disaster such as a hurricane, tornado, flood, extended freeze, or widespread windstorm.
    
    (d)  Affidavits for delay based on grounds other than those listed in Subsection (c) are unlawful and, if used, are of no effect.  The landlord may file subsequent affidavits, provided that the total delay of the repair or remedy extends no longer than six months from the date the landlord delivers the first affidavit to the tenant.
    
    (e)  The affidavit must be delivered to the tenant by any of the following methods:
    
    (1)  personal delivery to the tenant;
    
    (2)  certified mail, return receipt requested, to the tenant;  or
    
    (3)  leaving the notice securely fixed on the outside of the main entry door of the manufactured home if notice in that manner is authorized in a written lease.
    
    (f)  Affidavits for delay by a landlord under this section must be submitted in good faith.  Following delivery of the affidavit, the landlord must continue diligent efforts to repair or remedy the condition.  There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the landlord acted in good faith and with continued diligence for the first affidavit for delay the landlord delivers to the tenant.  The landlord shall have the burden of pleading and proving good faith and continued diligence for subsequent affidavits for delay.  A landlord who violates this section shall be liable to the tenant for all judicial remedies under Section [94.159](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=94.159), except that the civil penalty under Section [94.159](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=94.159)(a)(3) shall be one month's rent plus $1,000.

    (3)  For conditions other than those specified in Subdivision (2), if the new landlord acquires title as described by this subsection and has notified the tenant of the name and address of the new landlord or the new landlord's authorized agent and if the tenant has not already contracted for the repair or remedy at the time the tenant is so notified, the tenant must deliver to the new landlord a written notice of intent to repair or remedy the condition, and the new landlord shall have a reasonable time to complete the repair before the tenant may repair or remedy the condition.  No further notice from the tenant is necessary in order for the tenant to repair or remedy the condition after a reasonable time has elapsed.
    
    (4)  The tenant's judicial remedies under Section [94.159](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=94.159) shall be limited to recovery against the landlord to whom the tenant gave the required notices until the tenant has given the new landlord the notices required by this section and otherwise complied with Section [94.156](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=94.156) as to the new landlord.

    Sec. 94.159.  TENANT'S JUDICIAL REMEDIES.  (a)  A tenant's judicial remedies under Section [94.156](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=94.156) shall include:
    
    (1)  an order directing the landlord to take reasonable action to repair or remedy the condition;
    
    (2)  an order reducing the tenant's rent, from the date of the first repair notice, in proportion to the reduced rental value resulting from the condition until the condition is repaired or remedied;
    
    (3)  a judgment against the landlord for a civil penalty of one month's rent plus $500;
    
    (4)  a judgment against the landlord for the amount of the tenant's actual damages;  and
    
    (5)  court costs and attorney's fees, excluding any attorney's fees for a cause of action for damages relating to a personal injury.
    
    (b)  A landlord who knowingly violates Section [94.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=94.003) by contracting with a tenant to waive the landlord's duty to repair under this subchapter shall be liable to the tenant for actual damages, a civil penalty of one month's rent plus $2,000, and reasonable attorney's fees.  For purposes of this subsection, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the landlord acted without knowledge of the violation.  The tenant shall have the burden of pleading and proving a knowing violation.  If the lease is not in violation of Section [94.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=94.003), the tenant's proof of a knowing violation must be clear and convincing.  A mutual agreement for tenant repair under Section [94.157](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=94.157)(i) is not a violation of Section [94.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=94.003).
    
    (c)  The justice, county, and district courts have concurrent jurisdiction of an action under Subsection (a), except that the justice court may not order repairs under Subsection (a)(1).

    (b)  Notice under this section must be in writing and may be given in person, by mail, or by delivery to the premises.

    (6)  the tenant holds over and the landlord's notice of termination is motivated by a good faith belief that the tenant, a member of the tenant's family, or a guest or invitee of the tenant might:
    
    (A)  adversely affect the quiet enjoyment by other tenants or neighbors;
    
    (B)  materially affect the health or safety of the landlord, other tenants, or neighbors;  or
