    SUBCHAPTER A. LIABILITY OF TRUSTEE
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 114.001.  LIABILITY OF TRUSTEE TO BENEFICIARY.  (a)  The trustee is accountable to a beneficiary for the trust property and for any profit made by the trustee through or arising out of the administration of the trust, even though the profit does not result from a breach of trust;  provided, however, that the trustee is not required to return to a beneficiary the trustee's compensation as provided by this subtitle, by the terms of the trust instrument, or by a writing delivered to the trustee and signed by all beneficiaries of the trust who have full legal capacity.
    
    (b)  The trustee is not liable to the beneficiary for a loss or depreciation in value of the trust property or for a failure to make a profit that does not result from a failure to perform the duties set forth in this subtitle or from any other breach of trust.
    
    (c)  A trustee who commits a breach of trust is chargeable with any damages resulting from such breach of trust, including but not limited to:
    
    (1)  any loss or depreciation in value of the trust estate as a result of the breach of trust;
    
    (2)  any profit made by the trustee through the breach of trust;  or
    
    (3)  any profit that would have accrued to the trust estate if there had been no breach of trust.
    
    (d)  The trustee is not liable to the beneficiary for a loss or depreciation in value of the trust property or for acting or failing to act under Section [113.025](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=113.025) or under any other provision of this subtitle if the action or failure to act relates to compliance with an environmental law and if there is no gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the trustee.  The provision of any instrument governing trustee liability does not increase the liability of the trustee as provided by this section unless the settlor expressly makes reference to this subsection.
    
    (e)  The trustee has the same protection from liability provided for a fiduciary under 42 U.S.C. Section 9607(n).

    Sec. 114.002.  LIABILITY OF SUCCESSOR TRUSTEE FOR BREACH OF TRUST BY PREDECESSOR.  A successor trustee is liable for a breach of trust of a predecessor only if he knows or should know of a situation constituting a breach of trust committed by the predecessor and the successor trustee:
    
    (1)  improperly permits it to continue;
    
    (2)  fails to make a reasonable effort to compel the predecessor trustee to deliver the trust property;  or

    (a-1)  The terms of a charitable trust may give a trustee or other person a power to direct the modification or termination of the trust.
    
    (b)  If the terms of a charitable trust give a person the power to direct certain actions of the trustee, the trustee shall act in accordance with the person's direction unless:
    
    (1)  the direction is manifestly contrary to the terms of the trust; or
    
    (2)  the trustee knows the direction would constitute a serious breach of a fiduciary duty that the person holding the power to direct owes to the beneficiaries of the trust.
    
    (c)  A person, other than a beneficiary, who holds a power to direct with respect to a charitable trust is presumptively a fiduciary required to act in good faith with regard to the purposes of the trust and the interests of the beneficiaries.  The holder of a power to direct with respect to a charitable trust is liable for any loss that results from a breach of the person's fiduciary duty.

    Sec. 114.0031.  DIRECTED TRUSTS; ADVISORS.  (a)  In this section:
    
    (1)  "Advisor" includes protector.
    
    (2)  "Investment decision" means, with respect to any investment, the retention, purchase, sale, exchange, tender, or other transaction affecting the ownership of the investment or rights in the investment and, with respect to a nonpublicly traded investment, the valuation of the investment.
    
    (b)  This section does not apply to a charitable trust as defined by Section [123.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=123.001).
    
    (c)  For purposes of this section, an advisor with authority with respect to investment decisions is an investment advisor.
    
    (d)  A protector has all the power and authority granted to the protector by the trust terms, which may include:
    
    (1)  the power to remove and appoint trustees, advisors, trust committee members, and other protectors;
    
    (2)  the power to modify or amend the trust terms to achieve favorable tax status or to facilitate the efficient administration of the trust; and
    
    (3)  the power to modify, expand, or restrict the terms of a power of appointment granted to a beneficiary by the trust terms.
    
    (e)  If the terms of a trust give a person the authority to direct, consent to, or disapprove a trustee's actual or proposed investment decisions, distribution decisions, or other decisions, the person is an advisor.  An advisor is a fiduciary regardless of trust terms to the contrary except that the trust terms may provide that an advisor acts in a nonfiduciary capacity if:
    
    (1)  the advisor's only power is to remove and appoint trustees, advisors, trust committee members, or other protectors; and
    
    (2)  the advisor does not exercise that power to appoint the advisor's self to a position described by Subdivision (1).
    
    (e-1)  Subsection (e) does not prohibit the exercise of a power in a nonfiduciary capacity as required by the Internal Revenue Code for a grantor or other person to be treated as the owner of any portion of the trust for federal income tax purposes.
    
    (f)  A trustee who acts in accordance with the direction of an advisor, as prescribed by the trust terms, is not liable, except in cases of wilful misconduct on the part of the trustee so directed, for any loss resulting directly or indirectly from that act.
    
    (g)  If the trust terms provide that a trustee must make decisions with the consent of an advisor, the trustee is not liable, except in cases of wilful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of the trustee, for any loss resulting directly or indirectly from any act taken or not taken as a result of the advisor's failure to provide the required consent after having been requested to do so by the trustee.
    
    (h)  If the trust terms provide that a trustee must act in accordance with the direction of an advisor with respect to investment decisions, distribution decisions, or other decisions of the trustee, the trustee does not, except to the extent the trust terms provide otherwise, have the duty to:
    
    (1)  monitor the conduct of the advisor;
    
    (2)  provide advice to the advisor or consult with the advisor; or
    
    (3)  communicate with or warn or apprise any beneficiary or third party concerning instances in which the trustee would or might have exercised the trustee's own discretion in a manner different from the manner directed by the advisor.
    
    (i)  Absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, the actions of a trustee pertaining to matters within the scope of the advisor's authority, such as confirming that the advisor's directions have been carried out and recording and reporting actions taken at the advisor's direction, are presumed to be administrative actions taken by the trustee solely to allow the trustee to perform those duties assigned to the trustee under the trust terms, and such administrative actions are not considered to constitute an undertaking by the trustee to monitor the advisor or otherwise participate in actions within the scope of the advisor's authority.

    Sec. 114.004.  ACTIONS TAKEN PRIOR TO KNOWLEDGE OR NOTICE OF FACTS.

    Sec. 114.006.  LIABILITY OF COTRUSTEES FOR ACTS OF OTHER COTRUSTEES.  (a)  A trustee who does not join in an action of a cotrustee is not liable for the cotrustee's action, unless the trustee does not exercise reasonable care as provided by Subsection (b).
    
    (b)  Each trustee shall exercise reasonable care to:
    
    (1)  prevent a cotrustee from committing a serious breach of trust; and
    
    (2)  compel a cotrustee to redress a serious breach of trust.
    
    (c)  Subject to Subsection (b), a dissenting trustee who joins in an action at the direction of the majority of the trustees and who has notified any cotrustee of the dissent in writing at or before the time of the action is not liable for the action.

    Sec. 114.007.  EXCULPATION OF TRUSTEE.  (a)  A term of a trust relieving a trustee of liability for breach of trust is unenforceable to the extent that the term relieves a trustee of liability for:
    
    (1)  a breach of trust committed:
    
    (A)  in bad faith;
    
    (B)  intentionally; or
    
    (C)  with reckless indifference to the interest of a beneficiary; or
    
    (2)  any profit derived by the trustee from a breach of trust.
    
    (b)  A term in a trust instrument relieving the trustee of liability for a breach of trust is ineffective to the extent that the term is inserted in the trust instrument as a result of an abuse by the trustee of a fiduciary duty to or confidential relationship with the settlor.
    
    (c)  This section applies only to a term of a trust that may otherwise relieve a trustee from liability for a breach of trust.  Except as provided in Section [111.0035](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=111.0035), this section does not prohibit the settlor, by the terms of the trust, from expressly:

    Sec. 114.083.  RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES FOR COMMITTING TORTS.  (a)  A personal liability of a trustee or a predecessor trustee for a tort committed in the course of the administration of the trust may be collected from the trust property if the trustee is sued in a representative capacity and the court finds that:
    
    (1)  the trustee was properly engaged in a business activity for the trust and the tort is a common incident of that kind of activity;
    
    (2)  the trustee was properly engaged in a business activity for the trust and neither the trustee nor an officer or employee of the trustee is guilty of actionable negligence or intentional misconduct in incurring the liability;  or
    
    (3)  the tort increased the value of the trust property.
    
    (b)  A trust that is liable for the trustee's tort under Subdivision (3) of Subsection (a) is liable only to the extent of the permanent increase in value of the trust property.
    
    (c)  A plaintiff in an action against the trustee as the representative of the trust does not have to prove that the trustee could have been reimbursed by the trust if the trustee had paid the claim.

    Sec. 114.084.  CONTRACTS OF TRUSTEE.  (a)  If a trustee or a predecessor trustee makes a contract that is within his power as trustee and a cause of action arises on the contract, the plaintiff may sue the trustee in his representative capacity, and a judgment rendered in favor of the plaintiff is collectible by execution against the trust property.  The plaintiff may sue the trustee individually if the trustee made the contract and the contract does not exclude the trustee's personal liability.
    
    (b)  The addition of "trustee" or "as trustee" after the signature of a trustee who is party to a contract is prima facie evidence of an intent to exclude the trustee from personal liability.
    
    (c)  In an action on a contract against a trustee in the trustee's representative capacity the plaintiff does not have to prove that the trustee could have been reimbursed by the trust if the trustee had paid the claim.

    Sec. 114.086.  CERTIFICATION OF TRUST.  (a)  As an alternative to providing a copy of the trust instrument to a person other than a beneficiary, the trustee may provide to the person a certification of trust containing the following information:
    
    (1)  a statement that the trust exists and the date the trust instrument was executed;
    
    (2)  the identity of the settlor;
    
    (3)  the identity and mailing address of the currently acting trustee;
    
    (4)  one or more powers of the trustee or a statement that the trust powers include at least all the powers granted a trustee by Subchapter [A](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=113.001), Chapter [113](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=113);
    
    (5)  the revocability or irrevocability of the trust and the identity of any person holding a power to revoke the trust;
    
    (6)  the authority of cotrustees to sign or otherwise authenticate and whether all or less than all of the cotrustees are required in order to exercise powers of the trustee; and
    
    (7)  the manner in which title to trust property should be taken.
    
    (b)  A certification of trust may be signed or otherwise authenticated by any trustee.
    
    (c)  A certification of trust must state that the trust has not been revoked, modified, or amended in any manner that would cause the representations contained in the certification to be incorrect.
    
    (d)  A certification of trust:
    
    (1)  is not required to contain the dispositive terms of a trust; and
    
    (2)  may contain information in addition to the information required by Subsection (a).
    
    (e)  A recipient of a certification of trust may require the trustee to furnish copies of the excerpts from the original trust instrument and later amendments to the trust instrument that designate the trustee and confer on the trustee the power to act in the pending transaction.
    
    (f)  A person who acts in reliance on a certification of trust without knowledge that the representations contained in the certification are incorrect is not liable to any person for the action and may assume without inquiry the existence of the facts contained in the certification.
    
    (g)  If a person has actual knowledge that the trustee is acting outside the scope of the trust, and the actual knowledge was acquired by the person before the person entered into the transaction with the trustee or made a binding commitment to enter into the transaction, the transaction is not enforceable against the trust.
    
    (h)  A person who in good faith enters into a transaction relying on a certification of trust may enforce the transaction against the trust property as if the representations contained in the certification are correct.  This section does not create an implication that a person is liable for acting in reliance on a certification of trust that fails to contain all the information required by Subsection (a).  A person's failure to demand a certification of trust does not:
    
    (1)  affect the protection provided to the person by Section [114.081](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=114.081); or
    
    (2)  create an inference as to whether the person has acted in good faith.
    
    (i)  A person making a demand for the trust instrument in addition to a certification of trust or excerpts as described by Subsection (e) is liable for damages if the court determines that the person did not act in good faith in making the demand.
    
    (j)  This section does not limit the right of a person to obtain a copy of the trust instrument in a judicial proceeding concerning the trust.
    
    (k)  This section does not limit the rights of a beneficiary of the trust against the trustee.

    Sec. 114.087.  INSTRUMENT NAMING TRUST AS PARTY.  (a)  The trustee of a trust is considered for all purposes to be the named party to an instrument that names the trust as a party to the instrument in any capacity, unless the trust is a legal entity under state law.
    
    (b)  Subsection (a) is effective as of the effective date of the original instrument.
