Except as provided by Subsection (h), the sale must take place at the county courthouse in the county in which the land is located, or if the property is located in more than one county, the sale may be made at the courthouse in any county in which the property is located. The commissioners court shall designate the area at the courthouse where the sales are to take place and shall record the designation in the real property records of the county. The sale must occur in the designated area. If no area is designated by the commissioners court, the notice of sale must designate the area where the sale covered by that notice is to take place, and the sale must occur in that area.
    
    (a-1)  If the first Tuesday of a month occurs on January 1 or July 4, a public sale under Subsection (a) must be held between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. on the first Wednesday of the month.
    
    (b)  Except as provided by Subsection (b-1), notice of the sale, which must include a statement of the earliest time at which the sale will begin, must be given at least 21 days before the date of the sale by:
    
    (1)  posting at the courthouse door of each county in which the property is located a written notice designating the county in which the property will be sold;
    
    (2)  filing in the office of the county clerk of each county in which the property is located a copy of the notice posted under Subdivision (1); and
    
    (3)  serving written notice of the sale by certified mail on each debtor who, according to the records of the mortgage servicer of the debt, is obligated to pay the debt.
    
    (b-1)  If the courthouse or county clerk's office is closed because of inclement weather, natural disaster, or other act of God, a notice required to be posted at the courthouse under Subsection (b)(1) or filed with the county clerk under Subsection (b)(2) may be posted or filed, as appropriate, up to 48 hours after the courthouse or county clerk's office reopens for business, as applicable.
    
    (c)  The sale must begin at the time stated in the notice of sale or not later than three hours after that time.
    
    (d)  Notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary, the mortgage servicer of the debt shall serve a debtor in default under a deed of trust or other contract lien on real property used as the debtor's residence with written notice by certified mail stating that the debtor is in default under the deed of trust or other contract lien and giving the debtor at least 20 days to cure the default before notice of sale can be given under Subsection (b).  The entire calendar day on which the notice required by this subsection is given, regardless of the time of day at which the notice is given, is included in computing the 20-day notice period required by this subsection, and the entire calendar day on which notice of sale is given under Subsection (b) is excluded in computing the 20-day notice period.
    
    (e)  Service of a notice under this section by certified mail is complete when the notice is deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid and addressed to the debtor at the debtor's last known address. The affidavit of a person knowledgeable of the facts to the effect that service was completed is prima facie evidence of service.
    
    (f)  Each county clerk shall keep all notices filed under Subdivision (2) of Subsection (b) in a convenient file that is available to the public for examination during normal business hours.  The clerk may dispose of the notices after the date of sale specified in the notice has passed.  The clerk shall receive a fee of $2 for each notice filed.
    
    (f-1)  A county shall prominently post a notice of sale filed with the county clerk under Subsection (b)(2) on the county's Internet website on a page where the county posts other auction information and that is publicly available for viewing without charge or registration.  Along with each notice of sale posted under this subsection, the county must post the date, time, and location of the sale on the same website page on which the notice is posted.
    
    (g)  The entire calendar day on which the notice of sale is given, regardless of the time of day at which the notice is given, is included in computing the 21-day notice period required by Subsection (b), and the entire calendar day of the foreclosure sale is excluded.
    
    (h)  For the purposes of Subsection (a), the commissioners court of a county may designate an area other than an area at the county courthouse where public sales of real property under this section will take place that is in a public place within a reasonable proximity of the county courthouse as determined by the commissioners court and in a location as accessible to the public as the courthouse door.  The commissioners court shall record that designation in the real property records of the county.  A designation by a commissioners court under this section is not a ground for challenging or invalidating any sale. A sale must be held at an area designated under this subsection if the sale is held on or after the 90th day after the date the designation is recorded.  The posting of the notice required by Subsection (b)(1) of a sale designated under this subsection to take place at an area other than an area of the courthouse remains at the courthouse door of the appropriate county.
    
    (i)  Notice served on a debtor under this section must state the name and address of the sender of the notice and contain, in addition to any other statements required under this section, a statement that is conspicuous, printed in boldface or underlined type, and substantially similar to the following:  "Assert and protect your rights as a member of the armed forces of the United States.  If you are or your spouse is serving on active military duty, including active military duty as a member of the Texas National Guard or the National Guard of another state or as a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States, please send written notice of the active duty military service to the sender of this notice immediately."

    Sec. 51.003.  DEFICIENCY JUDGMENT.  (a)  If the price at which real property is sold at a foreclosure sale under Section [51.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=51.002) is less than the unpaid balance of the indebtedness secured by the real property, resulting in a deficiency, any action brought to recover the deficiency must be brought within two years of the foreclosure sale and is governed by this section.
    
    (b)  Any person against whom such a recovery is sought by motion may request that the court in which the action is pending determine the fair market value of the real property as of the date of the foreclosure sale.  The fair market value shall be determined by the finder of fact after the introduction by the parties of competent evidence of the value.  Competent evidence of value may include, but is not limited to, the following:  (1) expert opinion testimony;  (2) comparable sales;  (3) anticipated marketing time and holding costs;  (4) cost of sale;  and (5) the necessity and amount of any discount to be applied to the future sales price or the cashflow generated by the property to arrive at a current fair market value.
    
    (c)  If the court determines that the fair market value is greater than the sale price of the real property at the foreclosure sale, the persons against whom recovery of the deficiency is sought are entitled to an offset against the deficiency in the amount by which the fair market value, less the amount of any claim, indebtedness, or obligation of any kind that is secured by a lien or encumbrance on the real property that was not extinguished by the foreclosure, exceeds the sale price.  If no party requests the determination of fair market value or if such a request is made and no competent evidence of fair market value is introduced, the sale price at the foreclosure sale shall be used to compute the deficiency.
    
    (d)  Any money received by a lender from a private mortgage guaranty insurer shall be credited to the account of the borrower prior to the lender bringing an action at law for any deficiency owed by the borrower.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the credit required by this subsection shall not apply to the exercise by a private mortgage guaranty insurer of its subrogation rights against a borrower or other person liable for any deficiency.

    (2)  the price at which the real property is sold is less than the unpaid balance of the indebtedness secured by the real property, resulting in a deficiency.
    
    (b)  Any person obligated on the indebtedness, including a guarantor, may bring an action in the district court in the county in which the real property is located for a determination of the fair market value of the real property as of the date of the foreclosure sale.  The suit must be brought not later than the 90th day after the date of the foreclosure sale unless the suit is brought by a guarantor who did not receive actual notice of the sale before the date of sale, in which case the suit must be brought by the guarantor not later than the 90th day after the date the guarantor received actual notice of the sale.  The fair market value shall be determined by the finder of fact after the introduction by the parties of competent evidence of the value.  Competent evidence of value may include:
    
    (1)  expert opinion testimony;
    
    (2)  comparable sales;

    (5)  the necessity and amount of any discount to be applied to the future sales price or the cash flow generated by the property to arrive at a fair market value as of the date of the foreclosure sale.
    
    (c)  If the finder of fact determines that the fair market value is greater than the sale price of the real property at the foreclosure sale, the persons obligated on the indebtedness, including guarantors, are entitled to an offset against the deficiency in the amount by which the fair market value, less the amount of any claim, indebtedness, or obligation of any kind that is secured by a lien or encumbrance on the real property that was not extinguished by the foreclosure, exceeds the sale price.  If no competent evidence of fair market value is introduced, the sale price at the foreclosure sale shall be used to compute the deficiency.

The suit must be brought not later than the 90th day after the date of the foreclosure sale or the date the guarantor receives actual notice of the foreclosure sale, whichever is later.

    (1)  expert opinion testimony;
    
    (2)  comparable sales;

    (1)  that is secured by a mortgage, deed of trust, or other contract lien, including a lien securing payment of an assessment or assessments, as applicable, on real property or personal property that is a dwelling owned by a military servicemember;
    
    (2)  that originates before the date on which the servicemember's active duty military service commences; and
    
    (3)  for which the servicemember is still obligated.
    
    (c)  In an action filed during a military servicemember's period of active duty military service or during the nine months after the date on which that service period concludes to foreclose a lien or otherwise enforce an obligation described by Subsection (b), the court may after a hearing and on the court's own motion, and shall on the application by a servicemember whose ability to comply with the obligations of the contract secured by the lien is materially affected by the servicemember's military service:
    
    (1)  stay the proceedings for a period of time as justice and equity require; or
    
    (2)  adjust the obligations of the contract secured by the lien to preserve the interests of all parties.

    (3)  made under a written agreement:
    
    (A)  executed during or after the servicemember's period of active duty military service; and
    
    (B)  specifying the legal instrument to which the waiver applies and, if the servicemember is not a party to the instrument, the servicemember concerned.
    
    (f)  A person commits an offense if the person knowingly makes or causes to be made a sale, foreclosure, or seizure of property that is prohibited by Subsection (d).  An offense under this subsection is a Class A misdemeanor.
    
    (g)  On application to a court, a dependent of a military servicemember is entitled to the protections of this section if the dependent's ability to comply with an obligation that is secured by a mortgage, deed of trust, or other contract lien on real property or personal property that is a dwelling is materially affected by the servicemember's military service.
    
    (h)  A court that issues a stay or takes any other action under this section regarding the enforcement of an obligation that is subject to this section may grant a similar stay or take similar action with respect to a surety, guarantor, endorser, accommodation maker, comaker, or other person who is or may be primarily or secondarily subject to the obligation.
    
    (i)  If a judgment or decree is vacated or set aside wholly or partly under this section, the court may also set aside or vacate, as applicable, the judgment or decree with respect to a surety, guarantor, endorser, accommodation maker, comaker, or other person who is or may be primarily or secondarily subject to the obligation that is subject to the judgment or decree.

    Sec. 51.016.  RESCISSION OF NONJUDICIAL FORECLOSURE SALES.  (a) This section applies only to a nonjudicial foreclosure sale of residential real property conducted under Section [51.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=51.002).  In this subsection, "residential real property" means:
    
    (1)  a single family home, duplex, triplex, or quadraplex; or
    
    (2)  a unit in a multiunit residential structure in which title to an individual unit is transferred to the owner of the unit under a condominium or cooperative system.
    
    (b)  Not later than the 15th calendar day after the date of a foreclosure sale, a mortgagee, trustee, or substitute trustee may rescind the sale under this section if:
    
    (1)  the statutory requirements for the sale were not satisfied;
    
    (2)  the default leading to the sale was cured before the sale;
    
    (3)  a receivership or dependent probate administration involving the property was pending at the time of sale;
    
    (4)  a condition specified in the conditions of sale prescribed by the trustee or substitute trustee before the sale and made available in writing to prospective bidders at the sale was not met;
    
    (5)  the mortgagee or mortgage servicer and the debtor agreed before the sale to cancel the sale based on an enforceable written agreement by the debtor to cure the default; or
    
    (6)  at the time of the sale, a court-ordered or automatic stay of the sale imposed in a bankruptcy case filed by a person with an interest in the property was in effect.
    
    (c)  On or before the 15th calendar day after the date of the sale, the party rescinding the sale shall:
    
    (1)  serve a written notice of rescission that describes the reason for the rescission and includes recording information for any affected trustee's or substitute trustee's deed that was recorded on:
    
    (A)  the purchaser, if the mortgagee is not the purchaser; and
    
    (B)  each debtor who, according to the records of the mortgage servicer of the debt, is obligated to pay the debt; and
    
    (2)  file each notice for recording in the real property records of the county in which all or a part of the property is located.
    
    (d)  A notice required by Subsection (c) must be served by certified mail.  Service of the notice is complete when the notice is deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid and addressed to the purchaser or debtor, as applicable, at the purchaser's or debtor's last known address, as applicable.  The affidavit of a person knowledgeable of the facts to the effect that service was completed is prima facie evidence of service.
    
    (e)  Not later than the fifth calendar day after the date a foreclosure sale is rescinded under this section, the mortgagee shall return to the purchaser by certified mail, electronic or wire transfer, or courier service with delivery tracking the amount of the bid paid by the purchaser for the property at the sale.  The debtor shall return to the trustee the amount of any excess proceeds received by the debtor from the sale.  The return of the bid amount is considered made on the date:
    
    (1)  the bid amount is deposited postage prepaid in the United States mail or with the courier service addressed to the purchaser at the purchaser's last known address; or
    
    (2)  the electronic or wire transfer is ordered.
    
    (f)  The rescinding mortgagee, trustee, or substitute trustee shall cause to be filed for recording in the real property records of the county where the notice required under Subsection (c) was recorded an affidavit stating the date the bid amount was returned together with the certified mail, electronic or wire transfer, or courier service delivery tracking information.
    
    (g)  An affidavit executed and filed in accordance with Subsection (f) is prima facie evidence of the return of the bid amount and of the authority of the maker of the affidavit. A bona fide purchaser, lender, or other person acquiring an interest in the property or an insurer of title is entitled to rely conclusively on the record of the filed affidavit and notice, and any subsequent purchaser in good faith and for value is entitled to bona fide purchaser protection.
    
    (h)  The rescission of a foreclosure sale under this section restores the mortgagee and the debtor to their respective title, rights, and obligations under any instrument relating to the foreclosed property that existed immediately prior to the sale.
    
    (i)  A rescission of a foreclosure sale under this section is void as to a creditor or to a subsequent purchaser for a valuable consideration without notice unless notice of the rescission has been acknowledged, sworn to, or proved and filed for recording as required by law. A rescission of a foreclosure sale under this section evidenced by an unrecorded instrument is binding on a party to the instrument, on the party's heirs, and on a subsequent purchaser who does not pay a valuable consideration or who has notice of the instrument.
    
    (j)  No action challenging the effectiveness of a rescission under this section may be commenced unless the action is filed on or before the 30th calendar day after the date the notices of rescission required by Subsection (c) are filed for recording.  A lis pendens notice based on the rescission not recorded within that period has no effect.  This subsection does not affect the limitations period for an action claiming damages resulting from the rescission.
    
    (k)  If the foreclosure sale is rescinded under this section for a reason listed in Subsection (b), other than a stay described by Subsection (b)(6), the court in a civil action filed by the purchaser challenging the effectiveness of the rescission or claiming damages resulting from the rescission may only award as damages to the purchaser the amount of the bid paid for the property by the purchaser at the sale that has not been refunded to the purchaser, plus interest on that amount at the rate of 10 percent per year.  Notwithstanding any other law, the court may not order specific performance of the sale as a remedy for the purchaser.  Interest awarded under this subsection ceases to accrue on the fourth day after the date the mortgagee deposits the amount of the damages awarded in the United States mail or with a courier for delivery to the purchaser.
    
    (l)  If a foreclosure sale is rescinded under this section for a reason provided by Subsection (b)(6), the court in a civil action filed by the purchaser challenging the effectiveness of the rescission or claiming damages resulting from the rescission may only award as damages to the purchaser the amount of the bid paid for the property by the purchaser at the sale that has not been refunded to the purchaser.
    
    (m)  Nothing in this section prohibits the rescission of a sale by agreement of the affected parties on other terms or a suit to rescind a sale not rescinded under this section.
