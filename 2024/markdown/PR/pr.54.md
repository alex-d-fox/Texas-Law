    (b)  If the landlord provides everything except labor, the lien attaches only to the crop grown in the year that the property is furnished.
    
    (c)  The lien does not attach to the goods of a merchant, trader, or mechanic if the tenant sells and delivers the goods in good faith in the regular course of business.
    
    (d)  A law exempting property from forced sale does not apply to a lien under this subchapter on agricultural products, animals, or tools.
