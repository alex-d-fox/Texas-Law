The policy required by this subsection must be recorded as a dedicatory instrument in accordance with Section [202.006](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=202.006).  An association may not charge an owner for the compilation, production, or reproduction of information requested under this section unless the policy prescribing those costs has been recorded as required by this subsection.  An owner is responsible for costs related to the compilation, production, and reproduction of the requested information in the amounts prescribed by the policy adopted under this subsection.  The association may require advance payment of the estimated costs of compilation, production, and reproduction of the requested information.  If the estimated costs are lesser or greater than the actual costs, the association shall submit a final invoice to the owner on or before the 30th business day after the date the information is delivered.  If the final invoice includes additional amounts due from the owner, the additional amounts, if not reimbursed to the association before the 30th business day after the date the invoice is sent to the owner, may be added to the owner's account as an assessment.

    Sec. 209.00591.  BOARD MEMBERSHIP.  (a)  Except as provided by this section, a provision in a dedicatory instrument that restricts a property owner's right to run for a position on the board of the property owners' association is void.
    
    (a-1)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a property owners' association's bylaws may require one or more board members to reside in the subdivision subject to the dedicatory instruments but may not require all board members to reside in that subdivision.  A requirement described by this subsection is not applicable during the development period.
    
    (a-2)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a property owners' association that governs a subdivision comprised of multiple sections may designate in an association instrument governing the administration or operation of the association a specified number of positions on the board, each of which must be elected from a designated section of the subdivision.  The instrument may require each board member representing a section to reside in that section.
    
    (a-3)  A person may not serve on the board of a property owners' association if the person cohabits at the same primary residence with another board member of the association.  This subsection does not apply:
    
    (1)  to an association with fewer than 10 residences; or
    
    (2)  during a subdivision's development period to affect the eligibility to serve on the board of:
    
    (A)  a person who cohabits with a developer of the subdivision regulated by the association; or
    
    (B)  the developer.
    
    (b)  If a board is presented with written, documented evidence from a database or other record maintained by a governmental law enforcement authority that a board member was convicted of a felony or crime involving moral turpitude not more than 20 years before the date the board is presented with the evidence, the board member is immediately ineligible to serve on the board of the property owners' association, automatically considered removed from the board, and prohibited from future service on the board.
    
    (c)  The declaration may provide for a period of declarant control of the association during which a declarant, or persons designated by the declarant, may appoint and remove board members and the officers of the association, other than board members or officers elected by members of the property owners' association.  Regardless of the period of declarant control provided by the declaration, on or before the 120th day after the date 75 percent of the lots that may be created and made subject to the declaration are conveyed to owners other than a declarant or a builder in the business of constructing homes who purchased the lots from the declarant for the purpose of selling completed homes built on the lots, at least one-third of the board members must be elected by owners other than the declarant.  If the declaration does not include the number of lots that may be created and made subject to the declaration, at least one-third of the board members must be elected by owners other than the declarant not later than the 10th anniversary of the date the declaration was recorded.

    (1)  in person or by proxy at a meeting of the property owners' association;
    
    (2)  by absentee ballot in accordance with this section;
    
    (3)  by electronic ballot in accordance with this section; or
    
    (4)  by any method of representative or delegated voting provided by a dedicatory instrument.
    
    (a-1)  Except as provided by this subsection, unless a dedicatory instrument provides otherwise, a property owners' association is not required to provide an owner with more than one voting method.  An owner must be allowed to vote by absentee ballot or proxy.
    
    (b)  An absentee or electronic ballot:
    
    (1)  may be counted as an owner present and voting for the purpose of establishing a quorum only for items appearing on the ballot;
    
    (2)  may not be counted, even if properly delivered, if the owner attends any meeting to vote in person, so that any vote cast at a meeting by a property owner supersedes any vote submitted by absentee or electronic ballot previously submitted for that proposal; and
    
    (3)  may not be counted on the final vote of a proposal if the motion was amended at the meeting to be different from the exact language on the absentee or electronic ballot.
    
    (b-1)  For purposes of Subsection (b), a nomination taken from the floor in a board member election is not considered an amendment to the proposal for the election.
    
    (c)  A solicitation for votes by absentee ballot must include:
    
    (1)  an absentee ballot that contains each proposed action and provides an opportunity to vote for or against each proposed action;
    
    (2)  instructions for delivery of the completed absentee ballot, including the delivery location; and
    
    (3)  the following language:  "By casting your vote via absentee ballot you will forgo the opportunity to consider and vote on any action from the floor on these proposals, if a meeting is held.  This means that if there are amendments to these proposals your votes will not be counted on the final vote on these measures.  If you desire to retain this ability, please attend any meeting in person.  You may submit an absentee ballot and later choose to attend any meeting in person, in which case any in-person vote will prevail."
    
    (d)  For the purposes of this section, "electronic ballot" means a ballot:
    
    (1)  given by:
    
    (A)  e-mail;
    
    (B)  facsimile; or
    
    (C)  posting on an Internet website;
    
    (2)  for which the identity of the property owner submitting the ballot can be confirmed; and
    
    (3)  for which the property owner may receive a receipt of the electronic transmission and receipt of the owner's ballot.
    
    (e)  If an electronic ballot is posted on an Internet website, a notice of the posting shall be sent to each owner that contains instructions on obtaining access to the posting on the website.
    
    (f)  This section supersedes any contrary provision in a dedicatory instrument.
    
    (g)  This section does not apply to a property owners' association that is subject to Chapter [552](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552), Government Code, by application of Section [552.0036](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552.0036), Government Code.

    (d)  A property owners' association authorized to use the procedure described by Subsection (a) may in its discretion elect not to use that procedure and instead foreclose the association's assessment lien under court judgment foreclosing the lien and ordering the sale, pursuant to Rules 309 and 646a, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.
    
    (e)  This section does not affect any right an association that is not authorized to use the procedure described by Subsection (a) may have to judicially foreclose the association's assessment lien as described by Subsection (d).

    (c)  A person who purchases property at a sale foreclosing a property owners' association's assessment lien may not transfer ownership of the property to a person other than a redeeming lot owner during the redemption period.
    
    (d)  To redeem property purchased by the property owners' association at the foreclosure sale, the lot owner or lienholder must pay to the association:
    
    (1)  all amounts due the association at the time of the foreclosure sale;
    
    (2)  interest from the date of the foreclosure sale to the date of redemption on all amounts owed the association at the rate stated in the dedicatory instruments for delinquent assessments or, if no rate is stated, at an annual interest rate of 10 percent;

    (5)  any reasonable cost incurred by the association, including mortgage payments and costs of repair, maintenance, and leasing of the property; and
    
    (6)  the purchase price paid by the association at the foreclosure sale less any amounts due the association under Subdivision (1) that were satisfied out of foreclosure sale proceeds.
    
    (e)  To redeem property purchased at the foreclosure sale by a person other than the property owners' association, the lot owner or lienholder:
    
    (1)  must pay to the association:
    
    (A)  all amounts due the association at the time of the foreclosure sale less the foreclosure sales price received by the association from the purchaser;

    (A)  any assessments levied against the property by the association after the date of the foreclosure sale and paid by the purchaser;
    
    (B)  the purchase price paid by the purchaser at the foreclosure sale;
    
    (C)  the amount of the deed recording fee;
    
    (D)  the amount paid by the purchaser as ad valorem taxes, penalties, and interest on the property after the date of the foreclosure sale; and

    (f)  If a lot owner or lienholder redeems the property under this section, the purchaser of the property at foreclosure shall immediately execute and deliver to the redeeming party a deed transferring the property to the lot owner.  If a purchaser fails to comply with this section, the lot owner or lienholder may file an action against the purchaser and may recover reasonable attorney's fees from the purchaser if the lot owner or the lienholder is the prevailing party in the action.
    
    (g)  If, before the expiration of the redemption period, the redeeming lot owner or lienholder fails to record the deed from the foreclosing purchaser or fails to record an affidavit stating that the lot owner or lienholder has redeemed the property, the lot owner's or lienholder's right of redemption as against a bona fide purchaser or lender for value expires after the redemption period.
    
    (h)  The purchaser of the property at the foreclosure sale or a person to whom the person who purchased the property at the foreclosure sale transferred the property may presume conclusively that the lot owner or a lienholder did not redeem the property unless the lot owner or a lienholder files in the real property records of the county in which the property is located:
    
    (1)  a deed from the purchaser of the property at the foreclosure sale; or
    
    (2)  an affidavit that:
    
    (A)  states that the property has been redeemed;
    
    (B)  contains a legal description of the property; and
    
    (C)  includes the name and mailing address of the person who redeemed the property.
    
    (i)  If the property owners' association purchases the property at foreclosure, all rent and other income collected by the association from the date of the foreclosure sale to the date of redemption shall be credited toward the amount owed the association under Subsection (d), and if there are excess proceeds, they shall be refunded to the lot owner.  If a person other than the association purchases the property at foreclosure, all rent and other income collected by the purchaser from the date of the foreclosure sale to the date of redemption shall be credited toward the amount owed the purchaser under Subsection (e), and if there are excess proceeds, those proceeds shall be refunded to the lot owner.
    
    (j)  If a person other than the property owners' association is the purchaser at the foreclosure sale, before executing a deed transferring the property to the lot owner, the purchaser shall obtain an affidavit from the association or its authorized agent stating that all amounts owed the association under Subsection (e) have been paid.  The association shall provide the purchaser with the affidavit not later than the 10th day after the date the association receives all amounts owed to the association under Subsection (e).  Failure of a purchaser to comply with this subsection does not affect the validity of a redemption.
    
    (k)  Property that is redeemed remains subject to all liens and encumbrances on the property before foreclosure.  Any lease entered into by the purchaser of property at a sale foreclosing an assessment lien of a property owners' association is subject to the right of redemption provided by this section and the lot owner's right to reoccupy the property immediately after redemption.
    
    (l)  If a lot owner makes partial payment of amounts due the association at any time before the redemption period expires but fails to pay all amounts necessary to redeem the property before the redemption period expires, the association shall refund any partial payments to the lot owner by mailing payment to the owner's last known address as shown in the association's records not later than the 30th day after the expiration date of the redemption period.
    
    (m)  If a lot owner or lienholder sends by certified mail, return receipt requested, a written request to redeem the property on or before the last day of the redemption period, the lot owner's or lienholder's right of redemption is extended until the 10th day after the date the association and any third party foreclosure purchaser provides written notice to the redeeming party of the amounts that must be paid to redeem the property.
    
    (n)  After the redemption period and any extended redemption period provided by Subsection (m) expires without a redemption of the property, the association or third party foreclosure purchaser shall record an affidavit in the real property records of the county in which the property is located stating that the lot owner or a lienholder did not redeem the property during the redemption period or any extended redemption period.
    
    (o)  The association or the person who purchased the property at the foreclosure sale may file an affidavit in the real property records of the county in which the property is located that states the date the citation was served in a suit under Subsection (a) and contains a legal description of the property.  Any person may rely conclusively on the information contained in the affidavit.
    
    (p)  The rights of a lot owner and a lienholder under this section also apply if the sale of the lot owner's property is conducted by a constable or sheriff as provided by a judgment obtained by the property owners' association.

The owner's demand must be made in writing and sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the registered agent of the property owners' association and to the association at the address for the association according to the most recently filed management certificate.  A copy of the notice must be sent to each property owner who is a member of the association.
