    Sec. 23A.007.  COTENANT BUYOUT.  (a)  If any cotenant requested partition by sale, after the determination of value under Section [23A.006](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=23A.006), the court shall send notice to the parties that any cotenant except a cotenant that requested partition by sale may buy all the interests of the cotenants that requested partition by sale.
    
    (b)  Not later than the 45th day after the date notice is sent under Subsection (a), any cotenant except a cotenant that requested partition by sale may give notice to the court that the cotenant elects to buy all the interests of the cotenants that requested partition by sale.
    
    (c)  The purchase price for each of the interests of a cotenant that requested partition by sale is the value of the entire parcel determined under Section [23A.006](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=23A.006) multiplied by the cotenant's fractional ownership of the entire parcel.
    
    (d)  After the period provided by Subsection (b) expires:
    
    (1)  if only one cotenant elects to buy all the interests of the cotenants that requested partition by sale, the court shall notify all the parties of that fact;
    
    (2)  if more than one cotenant elects to buy all the interests of the cotenants that requested partition by sale, the court shall:

    (B)  send notice to all the parties of that fact and of the price to be paid by each electing cotenant; or
    
    (3)  if no cotenant elects to buy all the interests of the cotenants that requested partition by sale, the court shall:
    
    (A)  send notice to all the parties of that fact; and
    
    (B)  resolve the partition action under Section [23A.008](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=23A.008)(a) or (b).
    
    (e)  If the court sends notice to the parties under Subsection (d)(1) or (2), the court shall set a date, not earlier than the 60th day after the date notice was sent, by which an electing cotenant must pay the cotenant's apportioned price into the court.  After that date:
    
    (1)  if all electing cotenants timely pay their apportioned price into court, the court shall:
    
    (A)  issue an order reallocating all the interests of the cotenants; and
    
    (B)  disburse the amounts held by the court to the persons entitled to them;
    
    (2)  if no electing cotenant timely pays its apportioned price, the court shall resolve the partition action under Section [23A.008](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=23A.008)(a) or (b) as if the interests of the cotenants that requested partition by sale were not purchased; or
    
    (3)  if one or more but not all of the electing cotenants fail to pay their apportioned price on time, the court shall give notice to the electing cotenants that paid their apportioned price of the interest remaining and the price for all that interest.
    
    (f)  Not later than the 20th day after the date the court gives notice under Subsection (e)(3), any cotenant that paid may elect to purchase all of the remaining interest by paying the entire price into the court.  After that period expires:
    
    (1)  if only one cotenant pays the entire price for the remaining interest, the court shall:
    
    (A)  issue an order reallocating the remaining interest to that cotenant;
    
    (B)  promptly issue an order reallocating the interests of all of the cotenants; and
    
    (C)  disburse the amounts held by the court to the persons entitled to the amounts;
    
    (2)  if no cotenant pays the entire price for the remaining interest, the court shall resolve the partition action under Section [23A.008](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=23A.008)(a) or (b) as if the interests of the cotenants that requested partition by sale were not purchased; or
    
    (3)  if more than one cotenant pays the entire price for the remaining interest, the court shall:
    
    (A)  reapportion the remaining interest among those paying cotenants, based on each paying cotenant's original fractional ownership of the entire parcel divided by the total original fractional ownership of all cotenants that paid the entire price for the remaining interest;
    
    (B)  promptly issue an order reallocating all of the cotenants' interests;
    
    (C)  disburse the amounts held by the court to the persons entitled to the amounts; and
    
    (D)  promptly refund any excess payment held by the court.
    
    (g)  Not later than the 45th day after the date the court sends notice to the parties under Subsection (a), any cotenant entitled to buy an interest under this section may request the court to authorize the sale as part of the pending action of the interests of cotenants named as defendants and served with the complaint but that did not appear in the action.
    
    (h)  If the court receives a timely request under Subsection (g), the court, after hearing, may deny the request or authorize the requested additional sale on such terms as the court determines are fair and reasonable, subject to the following limitations:
    
    (1)  a sale authorized under this subsection may occur only after the purchase prices for all interests subject to sale under Subsections (a) through (f) have been paid into court and those interests have been reallocated among the cotenants as provided in those subsections; and
    
    (2)  the purchase price for the interest of a nonappearing cotenant is based on the court's determination of value under Section [23A.006](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=23A.006).

    Sec. 23A.008.  PARTITION ALTERNATIVES.  (a)  If all the interests of all cotenants that requested partition by sale are not purchased by other cotenants under Section [23A.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=23A.007), or if after conclusion of the buyout under Section [23A.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=23A.007) a cotenant remains that has requested partition in kind, the court shall order partition in kind unless the court, after consideration of the factors listed in Section [23A.009](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=23A.009), finds that partition in kind will result in substantial prejudice to the cotenants as a group.  In considering whether to order partition in kind, the court shall approve a request by two or more parties to have the requesting parties' individual interests aggregated.
    
    (b)  If the court does not order partition in kind under Subsection (a), the court shall order partition by sale under Section [23A.010](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=23A.010) or, if no cotenant requested partition by sale, the court shall dismiss the action.
    
    (c)  If the court orders partition in kind under Subsection (a), the court may require that one or more cotenants pay one or more other cotenants amounts so that the payments, taken together with the value of the in-kind distributions to the cotenants, will make the partition in kind just and proportionate in value to the fractional interests held.
    
    (d)  If the court orders partition in kind, the court shall allocate to the cotenants that are unknown, unlocatable, or the subject of a default judgment, if those cotenants' interests were not bought out under Section [23A.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=23A.007), a part of the property representing the combined interests of those cotenants as determined by the court, and that part of the property shall remain undivided.

(a)  In determining under Section [23A.008](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=23A.008)(a) whether partition in kind would result in substantial prejudice to the cotenants as a group, the court shall consider the following:
    
    (1)  whether the heirs' property practicably can be divided among the cotenants;
    
    (2)  whether partition in kind would apportion the property in such a way that the aggregate fair market value of the parcels resulting from the division would be materially less than the value of the property if the property were sold as a whole, taking into account the condition under which a court-ordered sale likely would occur;
    
    (3)  evidence of the collective duration of ownership or possession of the property by a cotenant and one or more predecessors in title or predecessors in possession to the cotenant who are or were relatives of the cotenant or each other;
    
    (4)  a cotenant's sentimental attachment to the property, including any attachment arising because the property has ancestral or other unique or special value to the cotenant;
    
    (5)  the lawful use being made of the property by a cotenant and the degree to which the cotenant would be harmed if the cotenant could not continue the same use of the property;
    
    (6)  the degree to which the cotenants have contributed the cotenants' pro rata share of the property taxes, insurance, and other expenses associated with maintaining ownership of the property or have contributed to the physical improvement, maintenance, or upkeep of the property; and
    
    (7)  any other relevant factor.
    
    (b)  The court may not consider any one factor under Subsection (a) to be dispositive without weighing the totality of all relevant factors and circumstances.

    Sec. 23A.010.  OPEN-MARKET SALE, SEALED BIDS, OR AUCTION.  (a)  If the court orders a sale of heirs' property, the sale must be an open-market sale unless the court finds that a sale by sealed bids or at an auction would be more economically advantageous and in the best interest of the cotenants as a group.
    
    (b)  If the court orders an open-market sale and the parties, not later than the 10th day after the date the order is entered, agree on a real estate broker to offer the property for sale, the court shall appoint the broker and establish a reasonable commission.  If the parties do not agree on a broker, the court shall appoint a disinterested real estate broker to offer the property for sale and shall establish a reasonable commission.  The broker shall offer the property for sale in a commercially reasonable manner at a price no lower than the determination of value and on the terms and conditions established by the court.

    (d)  If the broker appointed under Subsection (b) does not obtain within a reasonable time an offer to purchase the property for at least the determination of value, the court, after hearing, may:
    
    (1)  approve the highest outstanding offer, if any;
    
    (2)  redetermine the value of the property and order that the property continue to be offered for an additional time; or
    
    (3)  order that the property be sold by sealed bids or at an auction.
    
    (e)  If the court orders a sale by sealed bids or at an auction, the court shall set terms and conditions of the sale.  If the court orders an auction, the auction must be conducted in the manner provided by law for a sale made under execution.
    
    (f)  If a purchaser is entitled to a share of the proceeds of the sale, the purchaser is entitled to a credit against the price in an amount equal to the purchaser's share of the proceeds.
