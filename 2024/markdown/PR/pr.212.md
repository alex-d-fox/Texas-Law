    (2)  is subject to restrictions the terms of which:
    
    (A)  provide that the restrictions expire;
    
    (B)  permit the restrictions to be extended after the initial restriction period expires if a majority of the owners of lots in the subdivision, by a written instrument that is acknowledged and filed for record, signify consent to the extension of the restrictions for a further period the maximum length of which is specified by the restrictions; and

    Sec. 212.003.  PROCEDURE FOR SUCCESSIVE EXTENSIONS.  (a)  Restrictions may be extended under this chapter by the written consent of the owners of a majority of the lots in the subdivision, without respect to the number of lots owned by a particular owner.

Any statute authorizing a property owner to opt out of the applicability of restrictions to the owner's property does not apply to restrictions extended under this chapter.
    
    (b)  An extension of restrictions under this chapter is binding on a lienholder or a person who acquires title to property at a foreclosure sale or by deed from a foreclosing lienholder.
