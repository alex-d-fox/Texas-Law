The nomination may be made in a will, a trust, a deed, an instrument exercising a power of appointment, or in a writing designating a beneficiary of contractual rights, including the right to receive payments from a benefit plan, that is registered with or delivered to the payor, issuer, or other obligor of the contractual rights.

    (1)  take control of custodial property;
    
    (2)  register or record title to custodial property if appropriate;  and
    
    (3)  collect, hold, manage, sell, convey, invest, and reinvest custodial property.
    
    (b)  In dealing with custodial property, a custodian shall observe the standard of care that would be observed by a prudent person dealing with property of another and is not limited by any other statute restricting investments by fiduciaries.  If a custodian has a special skill or expertise, the custodian shall use that skill or expertise.  However, a custodian, in the custodian's discretion and without liability to the minor or the minor's estate, may retain any custodial property received from a transferor.
    
    (c)  A custodian may invest in or pay premiums on life insurance or endowment policies on the life of:
    
    (1)  the minor only if the minor or the minor's estate is the sole beneficiary;  or

    (d)  A custodian at all times shall keep custodial property separate and distinct from all other property in a manner sufficient to identify it clearly as custodial property of the minor.  Custodial property consisting of an undivided interest is so identified if the minor's interest is held as a tenant in common and is fixed.  Custodial property subject to recordation is so identified if it is recorded, and custodial property subject to registration is so identified if it is registered, or held in an account designated, in the name of the custodian followed in substance by the words:  "as custodian for ____________________ (name of minor) under the Texas Uniform Transfers to Minors Act."

    Sec. 141.019.  RENUNCIATION, RESIGNATION, DEATH, OR REMOVAL OF CUSTODIAN;  DESIGNATION OF SUCCESSOR CUSTODIAN.  (a)  A person nominated to serve as a custodian under Section [141.004](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=141.004) or designated to serve as a custodian under Section [141.010](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=141.010) may decline to serve as custodian by delivering written notice to the person who made the nomination or to the transferor's legal representative.  If the event giving rise to a transfer has not occurred and no substitute custodian who is able, willing, and eligible to serve was nominated under Section [141.004](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=141.004), the person who made the nomination may nominate a substitute custodian under Section [141.004](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=141.004);  otherwise the transferor or the transferor's legal representative shall designate a substitute custodian at the time of the transfer, in either case from among the persons eligible to serve as custodian for that kind of property under Section [141.010](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=141.010)(a).

    (b)  A custodian at any time may designate as successor custodian a trust company or an adult other than a transferor under Section [141.005](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=141.005) by executing and dating an instrument of designation before a subscribing witness other than the successor.  If the instrument of designation does not contain or is not accompanied by the custodian's resignation, the designation of the successor does not take effect until the custodian resigns, dies, becomes incapacitated, or is removed.
    
    (c)  A custodian may resign at any time by delivering:
    
    (1)  written notice to the successor custodian and to the minor if the minor is at least 14 years of age;  and
    
    (2)  the custodial property to the successor custodian.

If the minor is younger than 14 years of age or fails to act within 60 days after the ineligibility, death, or incapacity of the custodian, the minor's guardian becomes successor custodian.  If the minor has no guardian or the minor's guardian declines to act, the transferor, the legal representative of the transferor or of the custodian, an adult member of the minor's family, or any other interested person may petition the court to designate a successor custodian.
    
    (e)  As soon as practicable, a custodian who declines to serve under Subsection (a) or resigns under Subsection (c), or the legal representative of a deceased or incapacitated custodian, shall put the custodial property and records in the possession and control of the successor custodian.  The successor custodian by action may enforce the obligation to deliver custodial property and records and becomes responsible for each item as received.
    
    (f)  A transferor, the legal representative of a transferor, an adult member of the minor's family, a guardian of the person of the minor, the guardian of the minor, or the minor if the minor is at least 14 years of age may petition the court to:
    
    (1)  remove the custodian for cause and designate a successor custodian other than a transferor under Section [141.005](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=141.005);  or
    
    (2)  require the custodian to give appropriate bond.

    (1)  an accounting by the custodian or the custodian's legal representative;  or
    
    (2)  a determination of responsibility, as between the custodial property and the custodian personally, for claims against the custodial property unless the responsibility has been adjudicated in an action under Section [141.018](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=141.018) to which the minor or the minor's legal representative was a party.
    
    (b)  A successor custodian may petition the court for an accounting by the predecessor custodian.
    
    (c)  The court, in a proceeding under this chapter or in any other proceeding, may require or permit the custodian or the custodian's legal representative to account.
