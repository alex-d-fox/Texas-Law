    (b)  In an action brought under this section, the court shall, on the motion of the person named in the RICO lien notice, immediately enter an order setting a date for hearing that is not earlier than the fifth day and not later than the 10th day after the date the action is filed, and the order and a copy of the complaint shall be served on the investigative agency not later than the third day after the date the action is filed.

    (g)  If a civil action brought under Chapter [140B](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=140B), Civil Practice and Remedies Code, is pending against a person named in a RICO lien notice, the court on motion by the person may grant the relief described by this section.
