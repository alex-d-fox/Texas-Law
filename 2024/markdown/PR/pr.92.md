    Sec. 92.009.  RESIDENTIAL TENANT'S RIGHT OF REENTRY AFTER UNLAWFUL LOCKOUT.  (a)  If a landlord has locked a tenant out of leased premises in violation of Section [92.0081](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=92.0081), the tenant may recover possession of the premises as provided by this section.
    
    (b)  The tenant must file with the justice court in the precinct in which the rental premises are located a sworn complaint for reentry, specifying the facts of the alleged unlawful lockout by the landlord or the landlord's agent.  The tenant must also state orally under oath to the justice the facts of the alleged unlawful lockout.
    
    (c)  If the tenant has complied with Subsection (b) and if the justice reasonably believes an unlawful lockout has likely occurred, the justice may issue, ex parte, a writ of reentry that entitles the tenant to immediate and temporary possession of the premises, pending a final hearing on the tenant's sworn complaint for reentry.
    
    (d)  The writ of reentry must be served on either the landlord or the landlord's management company, on-premises manager, or rent collector in the same manner as a writ of possession in a forcible detainer action.  A sheriff or constable may use reasonable force in executing a writ of reentry under this section.
    
    (e)  The landlord is entitled to a hearing on the tenant's sworn complaint for reentry.  The writ of reentry must notify the landlord of the right to a hearing.  The hearing shall be held not earlier than the first day and not later than the seventh day after the date the landlord requests a hearing.
    
    (f)  If the landlord fails to request a hearing on the tenant's sworn complaint for reentry before the eighth day after the date of service of the writ of reentry on the landlord under Subsection (d), a judgment for court costs may be rendered against the landlord.
    
    (g)  A party may appeal from the court's judgment at the hearing on the sworn complaint for reentry in the same manner as a party may appeal a judgment in a forcible detainer suit.
    
    (h)  If a writ of possession is issued, it supersedes a writ of reentry.
    
    (i)  If the landlord or the person on whom a writ of reentry is served fails to immediately comply with the writ or later disobeys the writ, the failure is grounds for contempt of court against the landlord or the person on whom the writ was served, under Section [21.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=21.002), Government Code.  If the writ is disobeyed, the tenant or the tenant's attorney may file in the court in which the reentry action is pending an affidavit stating the name of the person who has disobeyed the writ and describing the acts or omissions constituting the disobedience.  On receipt of an affidavit, the justice shall issue a show cause order, directing the person to appear on a designated date and show cause why he should not be adjudged in contempt of court.  If the justice finds, after considering the evidence at the hearing, that the person has directly or indirectly disobeyed the writ, the justice may commit the person to jail without bail until the person purges himself of the contempt in a manner and form as the justice may direct.  If the person disobeyed the writ before receiving the show cause order but has complied with the writ after receiving the order, the justice may find the person in contempt and assess punishment under Section [21.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=21.002)(c), Government Code.
    
    (j)  This section does not affect a tenant's right to pursue a separate cause of action under Section [92.0081](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=92.0081).
    
    (k)  If a tenant in bad faith files a sworn complaint for reentry resulting in a writ of reentry being served on the landlord or landlord's agent, the landlord may in a separate cause of action recover from the tenant an amount equal to actual damages, one month's rent or $500, whichever is greater, reasonable attorney's fees, and costs of court, less any sums for which the landlord is liable to the tenant.
    
    (l)  The fee for filing a sworn complaint for reentry is the same as that for filing a civil action in justice court.  The fee for service of a writ of reentry is the same as that for service of a writ of possession.  The fee for service of a show cause order is the same as that for service of a civil citation.  The justice may defer payment of the tenant's filing fees and service costs for the sworn complaint for reentry and writ of reentry.  Court costs may be waived only if the tenant executes a pauper's affidavit.
    
    (m)  This section does not affect the rights of a landlord or tenant in a forcible detainer or forcible entry and detainer action.

    (j)  If a tenant in bad faith files a sworn complaint for restoration of utility service resulting in a writ being served on the landlord or landlord's agent, the landlord may in a separate cause of action recover from the tenant an amount equal to actual damages, one month's rent or $500, whichever is greater, reasonable attorney's fees, and costs of court, less any sums for which the landlord is liable to the tenant.

    (1)  delivered the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the tenant at the tenant's dwelling; or
    
    (2)  made a notation in the landlord's files of the time, place, and method of providing the notice and the name of the person who delivered the notice by:

    (g)  A landlord is liable for any damage to a tenant's vehicle resulting from the negligence of a towing service that contracts with the landlord or the landlord's agent to remove vehicles that are parked in violation of the landlord's rules and policies if the towing company that caused the damage does not carry insurance that covers the damage.

    Sec. 92.0135.  NOTICE FOR DWELLING LOCATED IN FLOODPLAIN.  (a)  In this section:
    
    (1)  "100-year floodplain" means any area of land designated as a flood hazard area with a one percent or greater chance of flooding each year by the Federal Emergency Management Agency under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. Section 4001 et seq.).
    
    (2)  "Flooding" means a general or temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of a dwelling caused by:
    
    (A)  the overflow of inland or tidal waters;
    
    (B)  the unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff or surface waters from any established water source such as a river, stream, or drainage ditch; or
    
    (C)  excessive rainfall.
    
    (b)  A landlord shall provide to a tenant a written notice substantially equivalent to the following:
    
    "(Landlord) ( ) is or ( ) is not aware that the dwelling you are renting is located in a 100-year floodplain.  If neither box is checked, you should assume the dwelling is in a 100-year floodplain.  Even if the dwelling is not in a 100-year floodplain, the dwelling may still be susceptible to flooding. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) maintains a flood map on its Internet website that is searchable by address, at no cost, to determine if a dwelling is located in a flood hazard area. Most tenant insurance policies do not cover damages or loss incurred in a flood.  You should seek insurance coverage that would cover losses caused by a flood."
    
    (c)  Notwithstanding Subsection (b), a landlord is not required to disclose on the notice that the landlord is aware that a dwelling is located in a 100-year floodplain if the elevation of the dwelling is raised above the 100-year floodplain flood levels in accordance with federal regulations.
    
    (d)  If a landlord knows that flooding has damaged any portion of a dwelling at least once during the five-year period immediately preceding the effective date of the lease, the landlord shall provide a written notice to a tenant that is substantially equivalent to the following:
    
    "(Landlord) ( ) is or ( ) is not aware that the dwelling you are renting has flooded at least once within the last five years."
    
    (e)  The notices required by Subsections (b) and (d) must be included in a separate written document given to the tenant at or before execution of the lease.

    (k)  For purposes of Subsection (j), "significant financial loss of income" means a reduction of 10 percent or more of the tenant's household income caused by the tenant's military service.  A landlord is entitled to verify the significant financial loss of income in order to determine whether a tenant is entitled to terminate a lease if the tenant has signed a waiver under this section and moves within 30 miles of the dwelling into housing that is not owned or occupied by family or relatives of the tenant or the tenant's dependent.  For purposes of this subsection, a pay stub or other statement of earnings issued by the tenant's employer is sufficient verification.

    (2)  the fee is reasonable; and
    
    (3)  any portion of the tenant's rent has remained unpaid two full days after the date the rent was originally due.

Payment of the fee, charge, or other sum of money by a tenant does not waive the right or remedies provided by this section.

    (1)  the landlord is terminating the tenancy as soon as legally possible;  and

    (2)  the landlord may not allow reoccupancy or reconnection of utilities by separate meter within six months after the date the tenant moves out.

    (e)  A landlord who violates Subsection (b) or (d) is liable to the tenant for an amount equal to the total of one month's rent plus $100 and attorney's fees.

    (b)  A landlord is liable to a tenant as provided by this subchapter if:
    
    (1)  the tenant has given the landlord notice to repair or remedy a condition by giving that notice to the person to whom or to the place where the tenant's rent is normally paid;
    
    (2)  the condition materially affects the physical health or safety of an ordinary tenant;
    
    (3)  the tenant has given the landlord a subsequent written notice to repair or remedy the condition after a reasonable time to repair or remedy the condition following the notice given under Subdivision (1) or the tenant has given the notice under Subdivision (1) by sending that notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, by registered mail, or by another form of mail that allows tracking of delivery from the United States Postal Service or a private delivery service;
    
    (4)  the landlord has had a reasonable time to repair or remedy the condition after the landlord received the tenant's notice under Subdivision (1) and, if applicable, the tenant's subsequent notice under Subdivision (3);

    (d)  For purposes of Subsection (b)(3) or (4), in determining whether a period of time is a reasonable time to repair or remedy a condition, there is a rebuttable presumption that seven days is a reasonable time.  To rebut that presumption, the date on which the landlord received the tenant's notice, the severity and nature of the condition, and the reasonable availability of materials and labor and of utilities from a utility company must be considered.
    
    (e)  Except as provided in Subsection (f), a tenant to whom a landlord is liable under Subsection (b) of this section may:
    
    (1)  terminate the lease;

    (4)  obtain judicial remedies according to Section [92.0563](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=92.0563).
    
    (f)  A tenant who elects to terminate the lease under Subsection (e) is:
    
    (1)  entitled to a pro rata refund of rent from the date of termination or the date the tenant moves out, whichever is later;
    
    (2)  entitled to deduct the tenant's security deposit from the tenant's rent without necessity of lawsuit or obtain a refund of the tenant's security deposit according to law;  and
    
    (3)  not entitled to the other repair and deduct remedies under Section [92.0561](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=92.0561) or the judicial remedies under Subdivisions (1) and (2) of Subsection (a) of Section [92.0563](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=92.0563).
    
    (g)  A lease must contain language in underlined or bold print that informs the tenant of the remedies available under this section and Section [92.0561](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=92.0561).

    Sec. 92.0561.  TENANT'S REPAIR AND DEDUCT REMEDIES.  (a)  If the landlord is liable to the tenant under Section [92.056](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=92.056)(b), the tenant may have the condition repaired or remedied and may deduct the cost from a subsequent rent payment as provided in this section.
    
    (b)  The tenant's deduction for the cost of the repair or remedy may not exceed the amount of one month's rent under the lease or $500, whichever is greater.  However, if the tenant's rent is subsidized in whole or in part by a governmental agency, the deduction limitation of one month's rent shall mean the fair market rent for the dwelling and not the rent that the tenant pays.  The fair market rent shall be determined by the governmental agency subsidizing the rent, or in the absence of such a determination, it shall be a reasonable amount of rent under the circumstances.
    
    (c)  Repairs and deductions under this section may be made as often as necessary so long as the total repairs and deductions in any one month do not exceed one month's rent or $500, whichever is greater.
    
    (d)  Repairs under this section may be made only if all of the following requirements are met:
    
    (1)  The landlord has a duty to repair or remedy the condition under Section [92.052](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=92.052), and the duty has not been waived in a written lease by the tenant under Subsection (e) or (f) of Section [92.006](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=92.006).
    
    (2)  The tenant has given notice to the landlord as required by Section [92.056](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=92.056)(b)(1), and, if required, a subsequent notice under Section [92.056](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=92.056)(b)(3), and at least one of those notices states that the tenant intends to repair or remedy the condition.  The notice shall also contain a reasonable description of the intended repair or remedy.
    
    (3)  Any one of the following events has occurred:
    
    (A)  The landlord has failed to remedy the backup or overflow of raw sewage inside the tenant's dwelling or the flooding from broken pipes or natural drainage inside the dwelling.
    
    (B)  The landlord has expressly or impliedly agreed in the lease to furnish potable water to the tenant's dwelling and the water service to the dwelling has totally ceased.
    
    (C)  The landlord has expressly or impliedly agreed in the lease to furnish heating or cooling equipment;  the equipment is producing inadequate heat or cooled air;  and the landlord has been notified in writing by the appropriate local housing, building, or health official or other official having jurisdiction that the lack of heat or cooling materially affects the health or safety of an ordinary tenant.
    
    (D)  The landlord has been notified in writing by the appropriate local housing, building, or health official or other official having jurisdiction that the condition materially affects the health or safety of an ordinary tenant.
    
    (e)  If the requirements of Subsection (d) of this section are met, a tenant may:
    
    (1)  have the condition repaired or remedied immediately following the tenant's notice of intent to repair if the condition involves sewage or flooding as referred to in Paragraph (A) of Subdivision (3) of Subsection (d) of this section;
    
    (2)  have the condition repaired or remedied if the condition involves a cessation of potable water as referred to in Paragraph (A) of Subdivision (3) of Subsection (d) of this section and if the landlord has failed to repair or remedy the condition within three days following the tenant's delivery of notice of intent to repair;
    
    (3)  have the condition repaired or remedied if the condition involves inadequate heat or cooled air as referred to in Paragraph (C) of Subdivision (3) of Subsection (d) of this section and if the landlord has failed to repair the condition within three days after delivery of the tenant's notice of intent to repair;  or
    
    (4)  have the condition repaired or remedied if the condition is not covered by Paragraph (A), (B), or (C) of Subdivision (3) of Subsection (d) of this section and involves a condition affecting the physical health or safety of the ordinary tenant as referred to in Paragraph (D) of Subdivision (3) of Subsection (d) of this section and if the landlord has failed to repair or remedy the condition within seven days after delivery of the tenant's notice of intent to repair.

Unless the landlord and tenant agree otherwise under Subsection (g) of this section, repairs may not be made by the tenant, the tenant's immediate family, the tenant's employer or employees, or a company in which the tenant has an ownership interest.  Repairs may not be made to the foundation or load-bearing structural elements of the building if it contains two or more dwelling units.
    
    (g)  A landlord and a tenant may mutually agree for the tenant to repair or remedy, at the landlord's expense, any condition of the dwelling regardless of whether it materially affects the health or safety of an ordinary tenant.  However, the landlord's duty to repair or remedy conditions covered by this subchapter may not be waived except as provided by Subsection (e) or (f) of Section [92.006](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=92.006).
    
    (h)  Repairs made pursuant to the tenant's notice must be made in compliance with applicable building codes, including a building permit when required.
    
    (i)  The tenant shall not have authority to contract for labor or materials in excess of what the tenant may deduct under this section.  The landlord is not liable to repairmen, contractors, or material suppliers who furnish labor or materials to repair or remedy the condition.  A repairman or supplier shall not have a lien for materials or services arising out of repairs contracted for by the tenant under this section.
    
    (j)  When deducting the cost of repairs from the rent payment, the tenant shall furnish the landlord, along with payment of the balance of the rent, a copy of the repair bill and the receipt for its payment.  A repair bill and receipt may be the same document.
    
    (k)  If the landlord repairs or remedies the condition or delivers an affidavit for delay under Section [92.0562](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=92.0562) to the tenant after the tenant has contacted a repairman but before the repairman commences work, the landlord shall be liable for the cost incurred by the tenant for the repairman's trip charge, and the tenant may deduct the charge from the tenant's rent as if it were a repair cost.

    Sec. 92.0562.  LANDLORD AFFIDAVIT FOR DELAY.  (a)  The tenant must delay contracting for repairs under Section [92.0561](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=92.0561) if, before the tenant contracts for the repairs, the landlord delivers to the tenant an affidavit, signed and sworn to under oath by the landlord or his authorized agent and complying with this section.
    
    (b)  The affidavit must summarize the reasons for the delay and the diligent efforts made by the landlord up to the date of the affidavit to get the repairs done.  The affidavit must state facts showing that the landlord has made and is making diligent efforts to repair the condition, and it must contain dates, names, addresses, and telephone numbers of contractors, suppliers, and repairmen contacted by the owner.
    
    (c)  Affidavits under this section may delay repair by the tenant for:
    
    (1)  15 days if the landlord's failure to repair is caused by a delay in obtaining necessary parts for which the landlord is not at fault;  or
    
    (2)  30 days if the landlord's failure to repair is caused by a general shortage of labor or materials for repair following a natural disaster such as a hurricane, tornado, flood, extended freeze, or widespread windstorm.
    
    (d)  Affidavits for delay based on grounds other than those listed in Subsection (c) of this section are unlawful, and if used, they are of no effect.  The landlord may file subsequent affidavits, provided that the total delay of the repair or remedy extends no longer than six months from the date the landlord delivers the first affidavit to the tenant.
    
    (e)  The affidavit must be delivered to the tenant by any of the following methods:
    
    (1)  personal delivery to the tenant;
    
    (2)  certified mail, return receipt requested, to the tenant;  or
    
    (3)  leaving the notice inside the dwelling in a conspicuous place if notice in that manner is authorized in a written lease.
    
    (f)  Affidavits for delay by a landlord under this section must be submitted in good faith.  Following delivery of the affidavit, the landlord must continue diligent efforts to repair or remedy the condition.  There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the landlord acted in good faith and with continued diligence for the first affidavit for delay the landlord delivers to the tenant.  The landlord shall have the burden of pleading and proving good faith and continued diligence for subsequent affidavits for delay.  A landlord who violates this section shall be liable to the tenant for all judicial remedies under Section [92.0563](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=92.0563) except that the civil penalty under Subdivision (3) of Subsection (a) of Section [92.0563](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=92.0563) shall be one month's rent plus $1,000.
    
    (g)  If the landlord is liable to the tenant under Section [92.056](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=92.056) and if a new landlord, in good faith and without knowledge of the tenant's notice of intent to repair, has acquired title to the tenant's dwelling by foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure, or general warranty deed in a bona fide purchase, then the following shall apply:
    
    (1)  The tenant's right to terminate the lease under this subchapter shall not be affected, and the tenant shall have no duty to give additional notice to the new landlord.
    
    (2)  The tenant's right to repair and deduct for conditions involving sewage backup or overflow, flooding inside the dwelling, or a cutoff of potable water under Subsection (e) of Section [92.0561](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=92.0561) shall not be affected, and the tenant shall have no duty to give additional notice to the new landlord.
    
    (3)  For conditions other than those specified in Subdivision (2) of this subsection, if the new landlord acquires title as described in this subsection and has notified the tenant of the name and address of the new landlord or the new landlord's authorized agent and if the tenant has not already contracted for the repair or remedy at the time the tenant is so notified, the tenant must deliver to the new landlord a written notice of intent to repair or remedy the condition, and the new landlord shall have a reasonable time to complete the repair before the tenant may repair or remedy the condition.  No further notice from the tenant is necessary in order for the tenant to repair or remedy the condition after a reasonable time has elapsed.
    
    (4)  The tenant's judicial remedies under Section [92.0563](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=92.0563) shall be limited to recovery against the landlord to whom the tenant gave the required notices until the tenant has given the new landlord the notices required by this section and otherwise complied with Section [92.056](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=92.056) as to the new landlord.
    
    (5)  If the new landlord violates this subsection, the new landlord is liable to the tenant for a civil penalty of one month's rent plus $2,000, actual damages, and attorney's fees.
    
    (6)  No provision of this section shall affect any right of a foreclosing superior lienholder to terminate, according to law, any interest in the premises held by the holders of subordinate liens, encumbrances, leases, or other interests and shall not affect any right of the tenant to terminate the lease according to law.

    (1)  an order directing the landlord to take reasonable action to repair or remedy the condition;
    
    (2)  an order reducing the tenant's rent, from the date of the first repair notice, in proportion to the reduced rental value resulting from the condition until the condition is repaired or remedied;
    
    (3)  a judgment against the landlord for a civil penalty of one month's rent plus $500;
    
    (4)  a judgment against the landlord for the amount of the tenant's actual damages;  and
    
    (5)  court costs and attorney's fees, excluding any attorney's fees for a cause of action for damages relating to a personal injury.
    
    (b)  A landlord who knowingly violates Section [92.006](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=92.006) by contracting orally or in writing with a tenant to waive the landlord's duty to repair under this subchapter shall be liable to the tenant for actual damages, a civil penalty of one month's rent plus $2,000, and reasonable attorney's fees.  For purposes of this subsection, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the landlord acted without knowledge of the violation.  The tenant shall have the burden of pleading and proving a knowing violation.  If the lease is in writing and is not in violation of Section [92.006](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=92.006), the tenant's proof of a knowing violation must be clear and convincing.  A mutual agreement for tenant repair under Subsection (g) of Section [92.0561](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=92.0561) is not a violation of Section [92.006](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=92.006).
    
    (c)  The justice, county, and district courts have concurrent jurisdiction in an action under Subsection (a).
    
    (d)  If a suit is filed in a justice court requesting relief under Subsection (a), the justice court shall conduct a hearing on the request not earlier than the sixth day after the date of service of citation and not later than the 10th day after that date.
    
    (e)  A justice court may not award a judgment under this section, including an order of repair, that exceeds $20,000, excluding interest and costs of court.
    
    (f)  An appeal of a judgment of a justice court under this section takes precedence in county court and may be held at any time after the eighth day after the date the transcript is filed in the county court.  An owner of real property who files a notice of appeal of a judgment of a justice court to the county court perfects the owner's appeal and stays the effect of the judgment without the necessity of posting an appeal bond.

    (b)  At the time a landlord offers to a tenant the option of paying a fee in lieu of a security deposit, the landlord shall notify the tenant in writing:
    
    (1)  that the tenant has the option to instead pay a security deposit;

    (2)  the tenant.

A landlord may not charge the tenant a fee that is more than the reasonable cost of obtaining and administering the insurance purchased under this subsection.
    
    (f)  If the tenant decides to pay a fee in lieu of a security deposit and the landlord purchases insurance coverage as described by Subsection (e), an agreement required under Subsection (c) must clearly specify the following terms:

    (B)  damages for which the tenant is legally liable under the lease, other than normal wear and tear; and
    
    (4)  the fee, unless otherwise specified, is not paying for insurance that covers the tenant or otherwise changes the tenant's obligation to pay rent and damages beyond normal wear and tear.
    
    (g)  Except as provided by Subsection (h), a fee collected under this section is a security deposit for purposes of this chapter.
    
    (h)  A fee collected under this section is not a security deposit for purposes of this chapter if:
    
    (1)  an agreement was signed under Subsection (c); and
    
    (2)  the fee is used to purchase insurance coverage for damages and unpaid rent for which the tenant is legally liable under the lease or as a result of breaching the lease.
    
    (i)  A landlord may not charge a tenant for normal wear and tear of a dwelling.
    
    (j)  A landlord may not submit a claim for damages or unpaid rent to an insurer for insurance described by Subsection (e) unless the landlord notifies the tenant of the damages or unpaid rent indebtedness not later than the 30th day after the date the tenant surrendered possession of the dwelling.  The notice must include a written description and itemized list of all damages, if any, and of unpaid rent, if any, including the dates the rent payments were due.
    
    (k)  If the tenant challenges the claim for damages or unpaid rent and that challenge results in a determination by the landlord or by a court that the notice of indebtedness is incorrect, the indebtedness is void and the landlord may not file an insurance claim for insurance purchased under Subsection (e) in the amount of the voided indebtedness.  If the landlord has already submitted to the insurer a claim for the voided indebtedness, the claim must be withdrawn.  If the insurance company has already paid the landlord for the invalidated claim, the landlord shall return the payment.
    
    (l)  If an insurer compensates a landlord for a tenant's damages or unpaid rent under a valid claim:
    
    (1)  the landlord may not seek or collect reimbursement from the tenant of the amounts that the insurer paid to the landlord;
    
    (2)  the insurer that has paid a landlord after receipt of a claim filed by a landlord, if allowed by a subrogation clause in the insurance described by Subsection (e) and before the first anniversary of the termination of the tenant's occupancy, may seek reimbursement from the tenant of only the amounts paid to the landlord; and
    
    (3)  the tenant is entitled to any defenses to payment against the insurer as against the landlord.
    
    (m)  If an insurer seeks reimbursement under Subsection (l)(2), the insurer must include in the reimbursement demand:
    
    (1)  evidence of damages or unpaid rent that the landlord submitted to the insurer;
    
    (2)  evidence of damage repair costs that the landlord submitted to the insurer; and
    
    (3)  a copy of the settled claim that documents payments made by the insurer to the landlord.

    (b)  A landlord may require a tenant to pay for repair or replacement of a security device if an underlined provision in a written lease authorizes the landlord to do so and the repair or replacement is necessitated by misuse or damage by the tenant, a member of the tenant's family, an occupant, or a guest, and not by normal wear and tear.

If management company employees perform the work, the charge may include reasonable overhead and profit but may not exceed the cost charged to the owner by the management company for comparable security devices installed by management company employees at the owner's request and expense.
    
    (e)  The owner of a dwelling shall reimburse a management company, managing agent, or on-site manager for costs expended by that person in complying with this subchapter.
