    Sec. 216.002.  FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  (a)  The legislature finds that:
    
    (1)  the inability of owners to extend or amend property restrictions in older subdivisions in which no zoning regulations apply creates uncertainty in living conditions and discourages investments in those subdivisions;
    
    (2)  owners in affected older subdivisions are reluctant or unable to provide proper maintenance, upkeep, and repairs of structures because of the inability to amend the restrictions in response to changing circumstances;
    
    (3)  these conditions will cause dilapidation of housing and other structures and cause unhealthful and unsanitary conditions in affected older subdivisions, contrary to the health, safety, and welfare of the public; and
    
    (4)  the existence of race-related covenants in restrictions, regardless of their unenforceability, is offensive, repugnant, and harmful to members of racial or ethnic minority groups and public policy requires that those covenants be removed.
    
    (b)  The purpose of this chapter is to provide a procedure for extending or amending restrictions for certain older subdivisions, including the removal of any restriction relating to race, religion, or national origin that is void and unenforceable under the United States Constitution or Section [5.026](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=5.026).

    Sec. 216.003.  APPLICABILITY OF CHAPTER.  (a)  This chapter applies only to an older subdivision that:
    
    (1)  is wholly or partly located in a municipality with a population of two million or more;
    
    (2)  had original restrictions that:
    
    (A)  for at least one section of the subdivision, did not have an express procedure that provides for successive extensions of the restrictions;
    
    (B)  did not have an express procedure for amending the restrictions;
    
    (C)  under the common law of this state could not be amended without the unanimous consent of:
    
    (i)  all owners in the subdivision; or
    
    (ii)  all owners in any section of the subdivision; and
    
    (D)  may no longer be valid due to an inability to extend or amend the restrictions; and
    
    (3)  has a single property owners' association in which all owners in the subdivision are eligible for membership but in which membership is not mandatory.
    
    (b)  This chapter applies to a restriction regardless of the date on which the restriction was created.
    
    (c)  This chapter supersedes any contrary requirement for the extension or amendment of a restriction in a dedicatory instrument of a subdivision to which this chapter applies.
    
    (d)  This chapter does not apply to:
    
    (1)  a residential subdivision described by Section [209.0041](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=209.0041)(b);
    
    (2)  a condominium, as defined by Section [81.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=81.002) or [82.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=82.003);
    
    (3)  any portion of a residential subdivision in which restrictions are no longer enforceable due to nonresidential use; or
    
    (4)  property that is owned by a university that was owned by the university on the effective date of this chapter.

(a)  Restrictions may be extended as provided by Section [216.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=216.007) or, if a dedicatory instrument provides a procedure for an initial extension of the original restrictions, that procedure may be used for successive extensions of the original restrictions unless the dedicatory instrument expressly prohibits the procedure from being used for successive extensions.  If the dedicatory instrument prohibits the procedure from being used to provide for automatic extension of restrictions, the procedure may not be used under this subsection to provide for automatic extension of the restrictions.
    
    (b)  A provision in a dedicatory instrument that prohibits the extension of an existing restriction during a certain period does not apply to a successive extension under a procedure for initial extension of original restrictions under Subsection (a).
    
    (c)  An extension of restrictions under this chapter may:
    
    (1)  be for a period equal to the original term of the restrictions or a shorter period; and
    
    (2)  subject to Subsection (a), provide for additional automatic extensions of the term of the restrictions for a period of not more than 10 years for each extension.
    
    (d)  A dedicatory instrument that provides for the extension of restrictions and does not provide for amendment of restrictions may be amended under this chapter, including by amending the provision providing for the extension of the restrictions.

    Sec. 216.007.  CONSENT REQUIRED FOR EXTENSION OR AMENDMENT OF RESTRICTIONS.  (a)  A restriction may be extended or amended by a petition or ballots that indicate the written consent of the owners of at least 66.6 percent of the total number of separately owned parcels or tracts in the subdivision, regardless of whether the parcels or tracts contain part or all of one or more platted lots or combination of lots, but not including any parcels or tracts excluded from applicability of this chapter under Section [216.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=216.003)(d).
    
    (b)  A restriction that is extended or amended as described by Subsection (a) applies to all sections of the subdivision other than property excluded from applicability of this chapter under Section [216.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=216.003)(d) to the extent that the extended or amended restriction expressly applies to the entire subdivision, regardless of whether:
    
    (1)  each section has separate restrictions; or
    
    (2)  each owner is a member of the property owners' association.
    
    (c)  If the original restrictions for a subdivision contain a lower percentage to extend or amend the restrictions, the percentage in the original restrictions controls.

    (b)  The petition or ballots may be provided to owners in separate documents.  The separate documents are considered to be one instrument.
    
    (c)  If a restriction is amended under this chapter, a petition or ballot for a subsequent amendment of the restrictions may not be distributed under Subsection (a) before the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the amended restriction  under Section [216.010](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=216.010).

    (c)  After an owner signs a petition or ballot for an extension or amendment of a restriction, the owner's subsequent conveyance of the owner's interest in real property in the subdivision covered by the extension or amendment does not affect the validity of the signature for the purposes of the petition or ballot.
