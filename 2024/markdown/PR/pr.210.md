    Sec. 210.003.  FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  (a)  The legislature finds that:
    
    (1)  the pending expiration of and the inability of owners to extend or modify property restrictions applicable to certain real estate subdivisions in this state creates uncertainty in living conditions and discourages investments in those subdivisions;
    
    (2)  owners of land in affected subdivisions are reluctant or unable to provide proper maintenance, upkeep, and repairs of structures because of the pending expiration of restrictions;
    
    (3)  financial institutions cannot or will not lend money for investments, maintenance, upkeep, or repairs in affected subdivisions;
    
    (4)  these conditions cause dilapidation of housing and other structures and cause unhealthful and unsanitary conditions in affected subdivisions, contrary to the health, safety, and welfare of the public; and
    
    (5)  the existence of race-related covenants in restrictions, regardless of their unenforceability, is offensive, repugnant, and harmful to members of racial or ethnic minority groups and public policy requires that those covenants be removed.
    
    (b)  The purpose of this chapter is to provide a procedure for extending or modifying residential restrictions and to provide for the removal of any restriction or other provision relating to race, religion, or national origin that is void and unenforceable under either the United States Constitution or Section [5.026](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=5.026).

    (b)  An extension or modification of existing restrictions that is approved by the owners becomes effective when the resolution required by Section [210.008](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=210.008) is filed as a dedicatory instrument with the county clerk of each county in which the subdivision is located.
    
    (c)  An extension or modification of existing restrictions that is approved by the owners under this chapter is binding on all properties in the subdivision.

    (c)  Except as provided by this subsection, the approval or disapproval of multiple owners of a property may be reflected by the signatures of a majority of the co-owners.  The approval or disapproval of owners who are married may be reflected by the signature of one of those owners.
    
    (d)  An owner is considered to have cast a vote if the owner signs the petition indicating approval or disapproval of the proposal or one or more specific provisions of the proposal.
