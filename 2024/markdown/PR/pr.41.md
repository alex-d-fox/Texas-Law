The court may appoint a surveyor and others as may be necessary to assist the commissioner.  The commissioner shall file his designation of the judgment debtor's homestead in a written report, together with a plat of the area designated, with the justice or clerk of the court not more than 60 days after the order of appointment is signed or within such time as the court may allow.

    (c)  The commissioner, a surveyor, and others appointed to assist the commissioner are entitled to such fees and expenses as are deemed reasonable by the court.  The court shall tax these fees and expenses against the judgment debtor as part of the costs of execution.
