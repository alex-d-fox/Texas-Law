    CHAPTER 11. PROVISIONS GENERALLY APPLICABLE TO PUBLIC RECORDS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 11.001.  PLACE OF RECORDING.  (a)  To be effectively recorded, an instrument relating to real property must be eligible for recording and must be recorded in the county in which a part of the property is located.  However, if such an instrument grants a security interest by a utility as defined in Section [261.001](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=261.001), Business & Commerce Code, the instrument may be recorded as required by Sections 261.004 and 261.006 of that code, and if such instrument is so recorded, the lien and the secured interest created by such instrument shall be deemed perfected for all purposes.
    
    (b)  If an instrument has been recorded in a proper county, the subsequent creation of a new county containing property conveyed or encumbered by the instrument does not affect the recording's validity or effect as notice.  The county court of the new county shall at its own expense:
    
    (1)  obtain a certified transcript of the record of all instruments conveying or encumbering property in the new county;
    
    (2)  deposit the transcript for public inspection in the recorder's office of the new county;  and
    
    (3)  make an index of the transcript.

    (b)  An authenticated instrument not in English that was executed before August 22, 1897, may be recorded and operate as constructive notice from the date of filing if:
    
    (1)  a correct English translation is recorded with the original instrument;  and
    
    (2)  the accuracy of the translation is sworn to before an officer authorized to administer oaths.
    
    (c)  An instrument acknowledged outside the United States or its territories in accordance with Section [121.001](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=121.001)(c)(3), Civil Practice and Remedies Code, that contains a certificate, stamp, or seal of a notary public or other official before whom the acknowledgment was taken or an apostille relating to the acknowledgment, any portion of which is not in English, may be recorded and operate as constructive notice from the date of filing if:
    
    (1)  a correct English translation of any non-English portion of the certificate, stamp, seal, or apostille is recorded with the original instrument;
    
    (2)  the accuracy of the translation is sworn to before an officer authorized to administer oaths;  and
    
    (3)  any apostille relating to the acknowledgment complies with the Hague Convention dated October 5, 1961, titled Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents.

    (2)  a penalty filing fee equal to the greater of $25 or twice the statutory recording fee for the instrument is paid.

    Added by Acts 1989, 71st Leg., ch. 161, Sec. 1, eff. May 25, 1989.  Amended by Acts 1991, 72nd Leg., ch. 205, Sec. 1, eff. Aug. 26, 1991.

    (c)  Notwithstanding Section [191.007](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=191.007)(c), Local Government Code, an instrument transferring an interest in real property to or from an individual must include a notice that appears on the top of the first page of the instrument in 12-point boldfaced type or 12-point uppercase letters and reads substantially as follows:
    
    NOTICE OF CONFIDENTIALITY RIGHTS:  IF YOU ARE A NATURAL PERSON, YOU MAY REMOVE OR STRIKE ANY OR ALL OF THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION FROM ANY INSTRUMENT THAT TRANSFERS AN INTEREST IN REAL PROPERTY BEFORE IT IS FILED FOR RECORD IN THE PUBLIC RECORDS:  YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER OR YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE NUMBER.
    
    (d)  The validity of an instrument as between the parties to the instrument and the notice provided by the instrument are not affected by a party's failure to include the notice required under Subsection (c).
    
    (e)  The county clerk may not under any circumstance  reject an instrument presented for recording solely because the instrument fails to comply with this section.  Other than the duty to redact an individual's social security number as required by Section [552.147](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552.147), Government Code, the county clerk has no duty to ensure that an instrument presented for recording does not contain an individual's social security number.
    
    (f)  The county clerk shall post a notice in the county clerk's office stating that instruments recorded in the real property or official public records or the equivalent of the real property or official public records of the county:
    
    (1)  are not required to contain a social security number or driver's license number; and
    
    (2)  are public records available for review by the public.
    
    (g)  All instruments described by this section are subject to inspection by the public.  The county clerk is not criminally or civilly liable for disclosing an instrument or information in an instrument in compliance with the public information law (Chapter [552](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552), Government Code) or another law.
    
    (h)  Unless this section is cited in a law enacted after September 1, 2003, this section is the exclusive law governing the confidentiality of personal information contained in the real property or official public records or the equivalent of the real property or official public records of a county.
    
    (i)  To the extent that federal law conflicts with this section, an instrument must contain the information required by and must be filed in a manner that complies with federal law.
    
    (j)  On receipt of a written request from a federal judge, including a federal bankruptcy judge, a marshal of the United States Marshals Service, a United States attorney, a state judge as defined by Section [572.002](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=572.002), Government Code, or a family member as defined by Section [31.006](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=31.006), Finance Code, of a federal judge, marshal, attorney, or state judge, the county clerk shall omit or redact from an instrument described by this section that is available in an online database made public by the county clerk, or by a provider with which the county commissioners court contracts to provide the online database, social security number, driver's license number, and residence address of the federal judge, marshal, attorney, state judge, or family member of the federal judge, marshal, attorney, or state judge.
