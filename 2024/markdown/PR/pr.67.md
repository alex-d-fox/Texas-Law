    Sec. 67.002.  OIL AND GAS LIEN.  (a)  To secure the obligations of a first purchaser to pay the sales price, each interest owner has an oil and gas lien to the extent of the interest owner's interest in oil and gas rights.  The oil and gas lien exists as part of and incident to the ownership of oil and gas rights.
    
    (b)  An oil and gas lien:
    
    (1)  exists in and attaches to all oil and gas before severance;

    (3)  continues uninterrupted and without lapse in and to all proceeds from the sale of the oil or gas.
    
    (c)  Except as provided by Subsection (d), an oil and gas lien exists until the interest owner or representative first entitled to receive the sales price has received the sales price for the oil or gas production, but the lien does not continue to attach to the production after the production is sold by the first purchaser, unless the first subsequent purchaser:
    
    (1)  is an affiliate of the first purchaser; or
    
    (2)  has actual knowledge, not constructive notice or inquiry notice, that the first purchaser has not paid the interest owner or representative first entitled to receive the sales price.

    (e)  Except as provided by Subsection (f), a first purchaser takes free of an oil and gas lien if the first purchaser:
    
    (1)  in good faith, paid the sales price for the oil or gas to an interest owner or representative otherwise apparently entitled to receive the sales price; and
    
    (2)  is without actual knowledge that the interest owner or representative is not entitled to receive the sales price paid.
    
    (f)  Notwithstanding Subsection (e), the oil and gas lien continues uninterrupted in the proceeds paid to or otherwise due the interest owner or representative.

    Sec. 67.003.  TRANSFER OF OIL AND GAS RIGHTS.  (a)  The validity of an oil and gas lien is not dependent on possession of the oil or gas by an interest owner or representative.  An oil and gas lien is not void or expired because of a change or transfer of the actual or constructive possession of or title to the oil or gas from the interest owner or representative to a first purchaser or other purchaser.
    
    (b)  On the conveyance or transfer of any oil and gas rights by a transferor interest owner, the oil and gas lien vested in the transferor interest owner immediately before the conveyance or transfer remains with the transferor interest owner to the extent of any oil and gas rights retained by the transferor interest owner.
    
    (c)  On the conveyance or transfer of any oil and gas rights by a transferor interest owner, the oil and gas lien vested in the transferor interest owner immediately before the conveyance or transfer is transferred to and attaches automatically to the oil and gas rights acquired by the transferee interest owner uninterrupted and without lapse and as part of and incident to the oil and gas rights that are conveyed or transferred.

    Sec. 67.005.  COMMINGLING.  (a)  If oil or gas in which there exists more than one oil and gas lien is commingled with other oil or gas in a manner that the identity of the specific oil or gas is lost, the oil and gas lien:
    
    (1)  continues without interruption into and attaches to any resulting commingled product; and
    
    (2)  is perfected automatically on the date of the oil and gas lien's original perfection but only for the volume of the commingled product that is equal to the volume of product to which the oil and gas lien originally attached.
    
    (b)  If commingling described by Subsection (a) occurs, the oil and gas lien in the commingled product has priority over any security interest or other lien that is not an oil and gas lien or permitted lien, regardless of whether the security interest or other lien has been properly perfected.
    
    (c)  If more than one oil and gas lien attaches to the commingled product, the oil and gas liens rank equally in the proportion that the respective sales prices secured by each oil and gas lien bears as a percentage of the total of the sales prices secured by all oil and gas liens applicable to the production at the time the production was commingled.
    
    (d)  This section is intended to recognize the continuation of oil and gas lien rights of an interest owner in the commingled product stream only as to a volume of oil or gas proportionate to the volume of oil or gas that originated from the interest owner, with that volume of the commingled product being considered to have maintained a distinct identity as being available for sale or transportation under the specific contractual arrangements applicable to the production at the time the oil or gas entered the commingled product stream.

    (2)  has paid all of the consideration due to the first purchaser, including by exchange of oil or gas, net-out, or set-off, under all applicable enforceable contracts in existence at the time of the payment.
