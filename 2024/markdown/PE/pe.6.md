    TITLE 2. GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY
    
      
    
    
    CHAPTER 6. CULPABILITY GENERALLY
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 6.01.  REQUIREMENT OF VOLUNTARY ACT OR OMISSION.  (a)  A person commits an offense only if he voluntarily engages in conduct, including an act, an omission, or possession.
    
    (b)  Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly obtains or receives the thing possessed or is aware of his control of the thing for a sufficient time to permit him to terminate his control.
    
    (c)  A person who omits to perform an act does not commit an offense unless a law as defined by Section [1.07](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=1.07) provides that the omission is an offense or otherwise provides that he has a duty to perform the act.
    
    
    
    
    Acts 1973, 63rd Leg., p. 883, ch. 399, Sec. 1, eff. Jan. 1, 1974.  Amended by Acts 1975, 64th Leg., p. 913, ch. 342, Sec. 3, eff. Sept. 1, 1975;  Acts 1993, 73rd Leg., ch. 3, Sec. 1, eff. Feb. 25, 1993;  Acts 1993, 73rd Leg., ch. 900, Sec. 1.01, eff. Sept. 1, 1994.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 6.02.  REQUIREMENT OF CULPABILITY.  (a)  Except as provided in Subsection (b), a person does not commit an offense unless he intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or with criminal negligence engages in conduct as the definition of the offense requires.
    
    (b)  If the definition of an offense does not prescribe a culpable mental state, a culpable mental state is nevertheless required unless the definition plainly dispenses with any mental element.
    
    (c)  If the definition of an offense does not prescribe a culpable mental state, but one is nevertheless required under Subsection (b), intent, knowledge, or recklessness suffices to establish criminal responsibility.
    
    (d)  Culpable mental states are classified according to relative degrees, from highest to lowest, as follows:
    
    (1)  intentional;
    
    (2)  knowing;
    
    (3)  reckless;
    
    (4)  criminal negligence.
    
    (e)  Proof of a higher degree of culpability than that charged constitutes proof of the culpability charged.
    
    (f)  An offense defined by municipal ordinance or by order of a county commissioners court may not dispense with the requirement of a culpable mental state if the offense is punishable by a fine exceeding the amount authorized by Section [12.23](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=12.23).
    
    
    
    
    Acts 1973, 63rd Leg., p. 883, ch. 399, Sec. 1, eff. Jan. 1, 1974.  Amended by Acts 1993, 73rd Leg., ch. 900, Sec. 1.01, eff. Sept. 1, 1994.
    
    Amended by: 
    
    Acts 2005, 79th Leg., Ch. 1219 (H.B. [970](http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/79R/billtext/html/HB00970F.HTM)), Sec. 1, eff. September 1, 2005.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 6.03.  DEFINITIONS OF CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.  (a)  A person acts intentionally, or with intent, with respect to the nature of his conduct or to a result of his conduct when it is his conscious objective or desire to engage in the conduct or cause the result.
    
    (b)  A person acts knowingly, or with knowledge, with respect to the nature of his conduct or to circumstances surrounding his conduct when he is aware of the nature of his conduct or that the circumstances exist.  A person acts knowingly, or with knowledge, with respect to a result of his conduct when he is aware that his conduct is reasonably certain to cause the result.
    
    (c)  A person acts recklessly, or is reckless, with respect to circumstances surrounding his conduct or the result of his conduct when he is aware of but consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the circumstances exist or the result will occur.  The risk must be of such a nature and degree that its disregard constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that an ordinary person would exercise under all the circumstances as viewed from the actor's standpoint.
    
    (d)  A person acts with criminal negligence, or is criminally negligent, with respect to circumstances surrounding his conduct or the result of his conduct when he ought to be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the circumstances exist or the result will occur.  The risk must be of such a nature and degree that the failure to perceive it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that an ordinary person would exercise under all the circumstances as viewed from the actor's standpoint.
    
    
    
    
    Acts 1973, 63rd Leg., p. 883, ch. 399, Sec. 1, eff. Jan. 1, 1974.  Amended by Acts 1993, 73rd Leg., ch. 900, Sec. 1.01, eff. Sept. 1, 1994.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 6.04.  CAUSATION:  CONDUCT AND RESULTS.  (a)  A person is criminally responsible if the result would not have occurred but for his conduct, operating either alone or concurrently with another cause, unless the concurrent cause was clearly sufficient to produce the result and the conduct of the actor clearly insufficient.
    
    (b)  A person is nevertheless criminally responsible for causing a result if the only difference between what actually occurred and what he desired, contemplated, or risked is that:
    
    (1)  a different offense was committed;  or
    
    (2)  a different person or property was injured, harmed, or otherwise affected.
