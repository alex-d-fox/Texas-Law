    Sec. 15.01.  CRIMINAL ATTEMPT.  (a)  A person commits an offense if, with specific intent to commit an offense, he does an act amounting to more than mere preparation that tends but fails to effect the commission of the offense intended.
    
    (b)  If a person attempts an offense that may be aggravated, his conduct constitutes an attempt to commit the aggravated offense if an element that aggravates the offense accompanies the attempt.
    
    (c)  It is no defense to prosecution for criminal attempt that the offense attempted was actually committed.
    
    (d)  An offense under this section is one category lower than the offense attempted, and if the offense attempted is a state jail felony, the offense is a Class A misdemeanor.

    (b)  An agreement constituting a conspiracy may be inferred from acts of the parties.

    (4)  the actor belongs to a class of persons that by definition of the object offense is legally incapable of committing the object offense in an individual capacity;  or
    
    (5)  the object offense was actually committed.
    
    (d)  An offense under this section is one category lower than the most serious felony that is the object of the conspiracy, and if the most serious felony that is the object of the conspiracy is a state jail felony, the offense is a Class A misdemeanor.

(a)  It is an affirmative defense to prosecution under Section [15.01](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=15.01) that under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete renunciation of his criminal objective the actor avoided commission of the offense attempted by abandoning his criminal conduct or, if abandonment was insufficient to avoid commission of the offense, by taking further affirmative action that prevented the commission.
