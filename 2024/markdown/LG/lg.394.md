    (4)  assists persons of low and moderate income to acquire and own decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing;  and
    
    (5)  preserves and increases the ad valorem tax bases of local governments.
    
    (c)  The legislature finds that the accomplishment of the results described by Subsection (b) is a public purpose and function and lessens the burdens of government.  The legislature further finds that:
    
    (1)  the creation of a housing finance corporation is for the benefit of the people of the state, improves the public health and welfare, and promotes the economy;
    
    (2)  those purposes are public purposes;  and
    
    (3)  the corporation, as a public instrumentality and nonprofit corporation, performs an essential governmental function on behalf of and for the benefit of the general public, the local government, and this state.
