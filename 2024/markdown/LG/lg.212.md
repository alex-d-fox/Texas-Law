    (b)  The owner of the tract:
    
    (1)  must:

If the facilities are fully operable before the expiration of the extension period, the facilities are considered to have been made fully operable in a timely manner.  An extension is not reasonable if it would allow a residence in the subdivision to be inhabited without water or sewer services.

    (c)  In addition to any other requirement of this chapter, a new plat must conform to the requirements of this section if any of the area subject to the new plat is a subdivision golf course.  The exception in Section [212.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=212.004)(a) excluding divisions of land into parts greater than five acres for platting requirements does not apply to a subdivision golf course.
    
    (d)  A new plat that is subject to this section may not be approved until each municipal authority reviewing the new plat conducts a public hearing on the matter at which the parties in interest and citizens have an adequate opportunity to be heard, present evidence, and submit statements or petitions for consideration by the municipal authority.  The number, location, and procedure for the public hearings may be designated by the municipal authority for a particular hearing.  The municipal authority may abate, continue, or reschedule, as the municipal authority considers appropriate, any public hearing in order to receive a full and complete record on which to make a decision.

    (e)  The municipal authority may not approve the new plat without adequate consideration of testimony and the record from the public hearings and making the findings required by Subsection (k).  Not later than the 30th day after the date on which all proceedings necessary for the public hearings have concluded, the municipal authority shall take action on the application for the new plat.  Sections [212.009](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=212.009)(a) and (b) do not apply to the approval of plats under this section.
    
    (f)  The municipality may provide notice of the initial hearing required by Subsection (d) only after the requirements of Subsections (m) and (n) are met.  The notice shall be given before the 15th day before the date of the hearing by:
    
    (1)  publishing notice in an official newspaper or a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the municipality is located;
    
    (2)  providing written notice, with a copy of this section attached, by the municipal authority responsible for approving plats to:
    
    (A)  each property owners' association for each neighborhood benefited by the subdivision golf course, as indicated in the most recently filed management certificates; and
    
    (B)  the owners of lots that are within 200 feet of the area subject to the new plat, as indicated:

    (3)  any other manner determined by the municipal authority to be necessary to ensure that full and fair notice is provided to all owners of residential single-family lots in the general vicinity of the subdivision golf course.
    
    (g)  The written notice required by Subsection (f)(2) may be delivered by depositing the notice, properly addressed with postage prepaid, in the United States mail.
    
    (h)  The cost of providing the notices under Subsection (f) shall be paid by the plat applicant.
    
    (i)  If written instruments protesting the proposed new plat are signed by the owners of at least 20 percent of the area of the lots or land immediately adjacent to the area covered by a proposed new plat and extending 200 feet from that area and are filed with the municipal planning commission or the municipality's governing body before the conclusion of the public hearings, the proposed new plat must receive, to be approved, the affirmative vote of at least three-fifths of the members of the municipal planning commission or governing body.
    
    (j)  In computing the percentage of land area under Subsection (i), the area of streets and alleys is included.
    
    (k)  The municipal planning commission or the municipality's governing body may not approve a new plat under this section unless it determines that:
    
    (1)  there is adequate existing or planned infrastructure to support the future development of the subdivision golf course;
    
    (2)  based on existing or planned facilities, the development of the subdivision golf course will not have a materially adverse effect on:
    
    (A)  traffic, parking, drainage, water, sewer, or other utilities;
    
    (B)  the health, safety, or general welfare of persons in the municipality; or
    
    (C)  safe, orderly, and healthful development of the municipality;
    
    (3)  the development of the subdivision golf course will not have a materially adverse effect on existing single-family property values;
    
    (4)  the new plat is consistent with all applicable land use regulations and restrictive covenants and the municipality's land use policies as described by the municipality's comprehensive plan or other appropriate public policy documents; and
    
    (5)  if any portion of a previous plat reflected a restriction on the subdivision golf course whether:
    
    (A)  that restriction is an implied covenant or easement benefiting adjacent residential properties; or
    
    (B)  the restriction, covenant, or easement has been legally released or has expired.
    
    (l)  The municipal authority may adopt rules to govern the platting of a subdivision golf course that do not conflict with this section, including rules that require more detailed information than is required by Subsection (n) for plans for development and new plat applications.
    
    (m)  The application for a new plat under this section is not complete and may not be submitted for review for administrative completeness unless the tax certificates required by Section [12.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=12.002)(e), Property Code, are attached, notwithstanding that the application is for a type of plat other than a plat specified in that section.
    
    (n)  A plan for development or a new plat application for a subdivision golf course is not considered to provide fair notice of the project and nature of the permit sought unless it contains the following information, complete in all material respects:
    
    (1)  street layout;
    
    (2)  lot and block layout;
    
    (3)  number of residential units;
    
    (4)  location of nonresidential development, by type of development;

    (6)  screening plan for adjacent residential properties, including landscaping or fencing; and
    
    (7)  an analysis of the effect of the project on values in the adjacent residential neighborhoods.
    
    (o)  A municipal authority with authority over platting may require as a condition for approval of a plat for a golf course that:
    
    (1)  the area be platted as a restricted reserve for the proposed use; and
    
    (2)  the plat be incorporated into the plat for any adjacent residential lots.
    
    (p)  An owner of a lot that is within 200 feet of a subdivision golf course may seek declaratory or injunctive relief from a district court to enforce the provisions in this section.

For purposes of this subsection, a significant need for public facilities is established if the failure to provide those public facilities would result in an overcapacity of public facilities or would be detrimental to the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the municipality.  The municipality must issue written findings based on reasonably available information.
    
    (b)  The written findings must include a summary of:
    
    (1)  evidence demonstrating that applying existing development ordinances or regulations and other applicable laws is inadequate to prevent the new development from causing the overcapacity of municipal infrastructure or being detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare in an affected geographical area;
    
    (2)  evidence demonstrating that alternative methods of achieving the objectives of the moratorium are unsatisfactory; and

    (b)  The written findings must include a summary of:
    
    (1)  evidence demonstrating the need to adopt new ordinances or regulations or to amend existing ordinances, including identification of the harm to the public health, safety, or welfare that will occur if a moratorium is not adopted;
    
    (2)  the geographical boundaries in which the moratorium will apply;
