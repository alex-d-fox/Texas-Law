    (c)  The county treasurer may not disburse money out of the county treasury without an order for payment from an officer who is authorized by law to issue the order.
    
    (d)  If the county treasurer doubts the legality or propriety of an order presented to the treasurer for payment, the treasurer may not make the payment.

The treasurer may require that the claim supporting the order be made available and verified by an affidavit after the claim is approved for payment by the commissioners court.
    
    (d-1)  In a county without a county auditor, the county treasurer may not make a payment if the treasurer has reason to believe that the check or order for payment is not valid as a proper and budgeted item of expenditure.  The treasurer shall report the matter to the commissioners court for consideration and direction.
    
    (e)  If the county treasurer is satisfied that an original check or other order drawn on the county treasury by a proper authority is lost or destroyed, the treasurer may issue a duplicate instrument in place of the original.  The treasurer may not issue a duplicate until an applicant has filed an affidavit with the treasurer that states that the applicant is the true owner of the original instrument and that, to the best knowledge and belief of the applicant, the original is lost or destroyed.
    
    (f)  The treasurer may require an applicant for a duplicate instrument to execute a bond with two or more good and sufficient sureties in an amount that is double the amount of the claim.  The bond must be:
    
    (1)  notarized;
    
    (2)  made payable to the county judge;
    
    (3)  conditioned that the applicant will hold the county harmless;
    
    (4)  conditioned that the applicant will return to the treasurer on demand by the treasurer the duplicate instrument or the amount of money named in the duplicate, including any costs that accrue against the county in collecting the amount;  and
    
    (5)  approved by the treasurer.
    
    (g)  If, after issuance of the duplicate instrument, the county treasurer determines that the duplicate was issued improperly or that the applicant or person to whom the duplicate was issued is not the owner of the original instrument, the treasurer shall immediately stop payment or demand the return of the amount paid by the county, if the duplicate is paid.  If the person fails to return the amount of the instrument, the treasurer shall institute a suit for recovery through the office of the county or district attorney.  Venue for the suit lies in the county in which the treasurer serves.
    
    (h)  A county treasurer may not honor a check or order for payment on the interest and sinking fund provided for a bond of the county or pay out or divert money in that fund except to pay the principal of or interest on the bond or invest money in securities as provided by law.

    (b)  The county treasurer may not issue and the county depository may not pay a check drawn on the county depository to take up an order for payment drawn by a proper authority, but the county treasurer shall, on the presentation of the order, endorse the order and deliver it to the payee, who may present it to the county depository for payment.
