    (1)  revenue from the municipality's gas or electric system, as the case may be, is adequate to satisfy the requirements of the ordinance or ordinances authorizing the outstanding revenue bonds and similarly secured bonds that may later be authorized, regarding the provision of funds for operation, maintenance, and debt service;  and
    
    (2)  revenue from the municipality's sanitary sewer system and, if encumbered under the contract, from the municipality's water system, are sufficient to meet the requirements of the contract with the authority.

    Sec. 552.065.  ASSESSMENT PROVISIONS.  (a)  By ordinance, the governing body of the municipality may:
    
    (1)  assess not more than nine-tenths of the estimated cost of improvements against the benefitted property and the owners of that property;
    
    (2)  provide the time, terms, and conditions of payment and defaults of the assessments;  and
    
    (3)  prescribe the interest rate on the assessment, not to exceed 10 percent a year.
    
    (b)  The governing body may issue in the name of the municipality assignable certificates in evidence of assessments levied under this section that declare the lien on the property and the liability of the owners whether named correctly or not.  The governing body may set the terms and conditions of those certificates.  If a certificate substantially states that the required proceeding relating to improvements referred to in the certificate has been held in compliance with law and that all the prerequisites to the fixing of an assessment lien against the property described in the certificate and the personal liability of the owner of the property have been performed, the certificate is prima facie evidence of all the matters recited in the certificate, and further proof is not required.  In a suit on an assessment or reassessment in evidence of which a certificate may be issued under this subchapter, it is sufficient to allege the substance of the recitals in the certificate and that those recitals are true.  Further allegations with reference to the proceedings relating to the assessment or reassessment are not necessary.
    
    (c)  An assessment against benefitted property under this section is collectable with interest, cost of collection, and reasonable attorney's fees.  The assessment is a first and prior lien on the assessed property and the lien takes effect on the date that a notice of proposed improvements is made under Section [552.067](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=552.067).  The lien is superior to any other lien or claim except a state, county, school district, or municipal property tax lien.  The assessment is a personal liability and charge against the owners of the assessed property on the date on which the lien takes effect, whether or not the owners are named in a notice, instrument, certificate, or ordinance provided for under this subchapter.
    
    (d)  The municipality may make assessments against several parcels of benefitted property in one assessment if the parcels are owned by the same person.  The municipality may jointly assess benefitted property owned jointly by one or more persons.

    (b)  Under the front foot rule, the governing body of the municipality shall assess each parcel of benefitted property according to the number of lineal feet of the parcel that abuts on a public street, irrespective of the location of improvements constructed under this subchapter relating to that parcel if the improvements provide water or sewer service to the assessed parcel.  The governing body shall assess a corner lot based on the shorter side of the lot that abuts on a public street.
    
    (c)  If, in the opinion of the governing body, application of that rule would result in injustice or inequality in particular cases, the governing body shall apportion and assess those costs in the proportion it considers just and equitable, taking into account the special benefits in enhanced value to be received by those owners, and shall adjust the apportionment so as to produce a substantial equality of benefits received and burdens imposed.

The notice must substantially show that the governing body has determined by order, directive, or otherwise that water or sewer system improvements are necessary, identify the required improvements by location or otherwise, state that a portion of the cost of the improvements is to be or has been specially assessed as a lien against the benefitted property, and describe that property.  One notice may contain any number of systems or improvements.
    
    (b)  It is not necessary that a notice under this section give details or be sworn to or acknowledged.  The governing body may file the notice at any time.

    Sec. 552.068.  EXEMPTIONS;  PERSONAL LIABILITY FOR ASSESSMENT.  (a)  All property, including church and school property, is subject to a tax or assessment authorized for local improvements under this subchapter.  However, this subchapter does not authorize the municipality or its governing body to fix a lien against any interest in property that is exempt from the lien of a special assessment for local improvements under the constitution of this state at the time the lien takes effect.  The owner of such a property is personally liable for any assessment made in connection with the improvement, and the municipality may refuse water or sewer service to the owner until the owner pays the municipality the assessment made against the property or an amount equal to the assessment made against private property of equal or comparable size.  The fact that an ordered improvement is omitted as to property, an interest in which is exempt, does not invalidate the lien or liability of assessment made against any other property.
    
    (b)  The municipality may enforce a lien created against any property and the personal liability of the owner of the property by an action in a court having jurisdiction or by sale of the assessed property in the manner provided by law or charter in effect in that municipality for the sale of property for municipal property taxes.
    
    (c)  As an aid to enforcement of the liability imposed by the assessment, the municipality may refuse to connect or may disconnect water or sewer service to a parcel of benefitted property during the period in which there is a default in the payment of any amount assessed under this subchapter against the parcel or its owner.

    Sec. 552.069.  NOTICE AND HEARING REQUIREMENTS;  APPEAL.  (a)  The municipality may not make an assessment under this subchapter against any benefitted property until it has given notice and provided an opportunity for a hearing as provided by this section.  The municipality may not make an assessment against any benefitted property or the owners of the property in excess of the enhancement of value of the property caused by the improvements as determined by the hearing.
    
    (b)  The municipality shall deliver the notice required under this section in writing by mailing the notice to the address of the owner of the property or to the person who last paid taxes on the property as determined by the municipal tax rolls.  The municipality must mail the notice before the 10th day before the date set for the hearing and must publish the notice at least three times in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality in which the special assessment tax is to be imposed.  The municipality shall publish the first notice before the 10th day before the date set for the hearing.  Proof of the mailing and publication constitutes proof that all the notice requirements of this section have been met.
    
    (c)  A notice is sufficient, valid, and binding on all persons who own or claim benefitted property or an interest in that property if the notice:
    
    (1)  generally describes the nature of the improvements for which the municipality proposes to make assessments and to which the notice relates;
    
    (2)  describes the water or sanitary sewer system to be improved or the portions of that system to which the improvements relate;
    
    (3)  states the estimated amount per front foot proposed to be assessed against benefitted property or the owners of the property;
    
    (4)  describes the property benefitted by each system or portion of system with reference to which the required hearing is to be held;
    
    (5)  states the estimated total cost of the improvements on each system or portion of a system;  and
    
    (6)  states the time and place of the hearing.
    
    (d)  The governing body of the municipality shall conduct the hearing.  Each person who owns or claims benefitted property or an interest in that property is entitled to be heard on any matter to which a hearing is a constitutional prerequisite to the validity of an assessment authorized by this subchapter.  Such a person may contest the amount of the proposed assessment, the lien and liability for the lien, the special benefits claimed for the property to be improved and its owner by means of improvements for which assessments are to be levied, and the accuracy, sufficiency, regularity, and validity of the proceedings and any contract in connection with the improvements and proposed assessments.  The governing body may correct any deficiencies and may determine the amounts of the assessments and other necessary matters.  By ordinance, the municipality may close the hearing and may levy the assessment for improvements before, during, or after the construction of those improvements.  The municipality may not make any part of such an assessment mature before the acceptance by the municipality of the improvements for which the assessment is levied.
    
    (e)  A person who owns or claims assessed property or an interest in that property may appeal the assessment based on the amount of the assessment;  on any inaccuracy, irregularity, invalidity, or insufficiency of the proceedings or contract relating to the assessment;  or on anything that is not within the discretion of the governing body of the municipality, by bringing suit in a court of competent jurisdiction within 15 days after the date the assessment is levied.  A claimant who does not bring suit within that time waives the right to contest any matter that might have been presented at the hearing and is barred and estopped from contesting the assessment or the proceedings and contract relating to the assessment in any manner.  The only defense to an assessment in a suit brought to enforce the assessment is failure to publish notice as required by this section or that the assessment exceeds the amount of the estimate.  The words or acts of any municipal officer or employee, including a member of the governing body, do not affect the force and effect of this subchapter, except for official actions of the governing body as shown in its written proceedings and records.

    (c)  If a substantial change is made after a hearing has been ordered or held, a new cost estimate and a new hearing with proper notices is required unless the improvement is totally abandoned.
    
    (d)  A change in or an abandonment of improvements requires the consent of any person who has contracted with the municipality for the construction of the improvements.
    
    (e)  If improvements are abandoned, the municipality shall pass an ordinance that cancels any assessments already levied for the improvements and that cancels any other proceedings relating to those improvements.

    SUBCHAPTER Z. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 552.901.  RELOCATION OR REPLACEMENT OF WATER OR SEWER LATERALS.  (a)  By ordinance, a municipality may contract for the relocation or replacement of a sanitation sewer lateral or water lateral that serves a residential structure on private property to connect the lateral to a new, renovated, or rebuilt sanitation main or water main constructed by the municipality.  The municipality shall assess the cost of the relocation or replacement of the lateral against the property on which the lateral is located.  A lien attaches to the property for the cost of the relocation or replacement.
    
    (b)  Before a municipality contracts under Subsection (a), the municipality must obtain the property owner's written consent to the contract, to the relocation or replacement of the sewer lateral or water lateral, and to the assessment.  The written consent must state that the person giving the consent is the property owner or the authorized representative of the property owner, must state the owner's address, and must state that:
    
    (1)  the consent is given freely;
    
    (2)  the owner understands that as a result of the assessment a lien attaches to the property for the total cost of the relocation or replacement;
    
    (3)  the municipality will not pay any part of the relocation or replacement cost;  and
    
    (4)  the owner has five years from the date the work is completed to repay the cost to the municipality.
    
    (c)  Before the contract for the work is made but after the municipality has received bids for the work, the municipality must give notice to the property owner.  The notice must state the bid price accepted by the municipality for the completion of the work and that the contract price may be increased by not more than 10 percent because of changes without the written consent of the owner.  The notice shall be given to the owner by personal delivery, or by depositing the notice in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the owner at the address in the owner's written consent.
    
    (d)  The municipality shall contract for the performance of the work in accordance with the law applicable to public improvements before work begins on the relocation or replacement of a lateral and after the municipality files the written consent of the property owner with the municipal clerk or municipal secretary.  The contract may be changed as necessary for the successful completion of the work, but the contract price may not be increased by more than 10 percent because of those changes without the written consent of the owner as provided by Subsection (c).
    
    (e)  Unless the owner waives the right to reject the contract as provided by Subsection (f) on or before the 45th day after the date the notice is mailed or delivered, the owner may exercise that right by notifying the municipal clerk or municipal secretary of the withdrawal of consent.  If the owner fails to withdraw consent during the 45-day period, the municipality may contract for the performance of the work, the work may proceed, and the assessment may be made without further consent by the owner.  After the expiration of the 45-day period, the owner may not withdraw the consent.
    
    (f)  The owner may waive the right to reject the contract by filing a sworn affidavit to that effect with the municipal clerk or municipal secretary.  After the affidavit is filed, the municipality may contract for the performance of the work, the work may proceed, and the assessment may be made without further consent by the owner.
    
    (g)  On receipt by the municipality of a certificate from the contractor certifying that all work has been completed in accordance with the contract, and on a finding by the municipality that the work has been properly completed in accordance with the applicable codes and ordinances of the municipality, the municipality may pay the contractor the cost of the completed work.
    
    (h)  When payment is made to the contractor, the municipality shall issue a certificate certifying that the work has been completed and that payment has been made under the contract.  The municipality shall file the certificate with the county clerk of the county in which the property is located and shall deliver a copy of the certificate to the property owner.
    
    (i)  The property owner, within five years after the date of the issuance of the certificate under Subsection (h), must pay the municipality the amount that the municipality paid for the completed work as evidenced by the certificate, plus simple interest in an amount not to exceed 10 percent a year as set by the governing body of the municipality.  On payment of the principal amount and accrued interest, the municipality shall issue a release of the assessment and lien.  The release may be filed for record as provided by law.
    
    (j)  If the property owner does not pay the assessment during the five-year period, the municipality may enforce the lien on the property in the same manner in which it is authorized by law to enforce the lien for a paving or other assessment.

    Sec. 552.902.  OPERATION OF CERTAIN ELECTRIC LIGHT AND POWER SYSTEMS BY HOME-RULE MUNICIPALITIES.  (a)  If a home-rule municipality, whose charter authorizes it to furnish electric light and power service inside and outside the municipal boundaries, owned and operated a municipal electric system as of July 4, 1949, and on that date owned and operated a rural electric system as a unit separate from the municipal system, and if the governing body of the municipality set up a rural electric system as a separate system, the bonds, mortgages, warrants, or other evidences of indebtedness are obligations of the system which they benefitted.  The obligations of one system do not apply to or affect the other system.
    
    (b)  Any issued obligation of a system is not a debt of the municipality but is only a charge on the properties of the system and may not be considered in determining the ability of the municipality to issue bonds for any purpose authorized by law.
    
    (c)  The expense of operation and maintenance of each system is a first lien and charge against the income of the system.  Operation and maintenance expenses include salaries, labor, repairs, cost of electrical energy, interest, repairs or extensions necessary for efficient service, and other proper operation and maintenance expenses.
    
    (d)  The governing body of the municipality shall charge and collect for each service a rate sufficient to:
    
    (1)  pay operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation, replacement, improvement, and interest;
    
    (2)  pay the principal of and interest on obligations issued against each system separately;  and
    
    (3)  maintain any reserves required by the ordinance authorizing the issuance of the obligations.
    
    (e)  None of the income of a system may be used to pay any other debt, expense, or operation until the secured indebtedness is finally paid.
    
    (f)  Each evidence of indebtedness issued by a municipality to which this section applies must contain the clause:  "The holder of the instrument hereof shall never have the right to demand payment of this obligation out of any funds raised or to be raised by taxation."  The evidence of indebtedness must be payable not more than 40 years from the date of the instrument and may bear interest at a rate not to exceed five percent a year.  The instrument must be signed by the mayor and countersigned by the municipal secretary.  Facsimile signatures of those officers may be printed on interest coupons attached to the instrument.
    
    (g)  A municipality to which this section applies is not required to submit an instrument issued against either of the systems to any public official of this state.  The only approval required or authorized by this section is that of the governing body of the municipality.  An obligation issued under this section is not contestable after issuance and delivery except for fraud and forgery.
    
    (h)  This section does not authorize a municipality to construct facilities or furnish electric power and energy to an area served with central station electric service as of July 4, 1949.
    
    (i)  An obligation issued under this section is exempt from state or local taxation.
    
    (j)  After a finding that a merger is in the best interests of its separately owned rural electric system and its municipal electric system, the governing body of a municipality to which this section applies may by ordinance order a merger of the systems.  After the merger, all laws relating to the municipal electric system, including laws relating to authorization and issuance of bonds, apply to the merged system.
