    (c)  The taxes imposed under this section are payable by the purchaser or consumer of the items subject to the tax except that if the person responsible for collecting the tax does not comply with this chapter by collecting and remitting the tax to the district, the person responsible for collecting the tax is liable for the tax.
    
    (d)  A person who does not hold a revenue permit issued by the board may not provide or offer for remuneration a service, a use of a facility, or a rental of an item if the price paid for the service, use, or rental is taxed under this section.  A person who holds a revenue permit issued by the district shall collect the taxes imposed under this section and shall report and remit the collected taxes to the district as the district requires.
    
    (e)  If a revenue permit holder remits taxes after the due date but on or before the 30th day after the due date, the revenue permit holder shall pay the district a penalty of five percent of the amount of taxes due.

    (i)  In the same manner that this section applies to a person who provides or offers a service, a use of a facility, or a rental of an item in the district, this section applies to a person who resides or does business outside the district but provides or offers recreational guide or shuttle services or the rental of water-oriented recreational equipment and the person regularly transports customers into the district for river access while the person is in the district.
    
    (j)  The board may settle a claim for a penalty or interest accrued on a tax imposed by this chapter if the board finds that the revenue permit holder exercised reasonable diligence to comply with this chapter.
