The officer has all the powers of a regular law enforcement officer of that county, municipality, or joint airport as fully as if the officer were in the county, municipality, or joint airport where regularly employed.  Qualification for office in the territory of regular employment constitutes qualification for office in the other county, municipality, or joint airport and no additional oath, bond, or compensation is needed.
    
    (b)  The law enforcement officer who is ordered by the official designated by the governing body of the county, municipality, or joint airport to perform police or peace duties outside the limits of that county, municipality, or joint airport where regularly employed is entitled to the same wage, salary, pension, and other compensation and rights, including injury or death benefits, as if the service were rendered in the county, municipality, or joint airport of the officer's regular employment.  The officer is also entitled to payment for any reasonable expenses incurred for travel, food, or lodging while on duty outside the limits of the territory of the officer's regular employment.
    
    (c)  The county, municipality, or joint airport regularly employing the law enforcement officer shall pay all wages and disability payments, pension payments, damages to equipment and clothing, medical expenses, and travel, food, and lodging expenses.  The county, municipality, or joint airport whose authorized official requested the services shall reimburse the original county, municipality, or joint airport after the payment is made and reimbursement is requested.  Each county, municipality, or joint airport may make these payments and reimbursements regardless of any provision in its charter or ordinances to the contrary.
