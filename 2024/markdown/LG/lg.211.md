(a)  The governing body of a municipality wishing to exercise the authority relating to zoning regulations and zoning district boundaries shall establish procedures for adopting and enforcing the regulations and boundaries.

Before the 15th day before the date of the hearing, notice of the time and place of the hearing must be published in an official newspaper or a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality.
    
    (a-1)  In addition to any notice required by this section or Section [211.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=211.007), the governing body of a municipality or a zoning commission, as applicable, shall provide written notice of each public hearing regarding any proposed adoption of or change to a zoning regulation or boundary under which a current conforming use of a property is a nonconforming use if the regulation or boundary is adopted or changed.

    "THE [MUNICIPALITY NAME] IS HOLDING A HEARING THAT WILL DETERMINE WHETHER YOU MAY LOSE THE RIGHT TO CONTINUE USING YOUR PROPERTY FOR ITS CURRENT USE.  PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY."
    
    (b)  In addition to the notice required by Subsection (a), a general-law municipality that does not have a zoning commission shall give notice of a proposed change in a zoning classification to each property owner who would be entitled to notice under Section [211.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=211.007)(c) if the municipality had a zoning commission.  That notice must be given in the same manner as required for notice to property owners under Section [211.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=211.007)(c).  The governing body may not adopt the proposed change until after the 30th day after the date the notice required by this subsection is given.
    
    (c)  If the governing body of a home-rule municipality conducts a hearing under Subsection (a), the governing body may, by a two-thirds vote, prescribe the type of notice to be given of the time and place of the public hearing.  Notice requirements prescribed under this subsection are in addition to the publication of notice required by Subsection (a).
    
    (d)  If a proposed change to a regulation or boundary is protested in accordance with this subsection, the proposed change must receive, in order to take effect, the affirmative vote of at least three-fourths of all members of the governing body.  The protest must be written and signed by the owners of at least 20 percent of either:
    
    (1)  the area of the lots or land covered by the proposed change;  or
    
    (2)  the area of the lots or land immediately adjoining the area covered by the proposed change and extending 200 feet from that area.

    (f)  The governing body by ordinance may provide that the affirmative vote of at least three-fourths of all its members is required to overrule a recommendation of the municipality's zoning commission that a proposed change to a regulation or boundary be denied.

    Sec. 211.007.  ZONING COMMISSION.  (a)  To exercise the powers authorized by this subchapter, the governing body of a home-rule municipality shall, and the governing body of a general-law municipality may, appoint a zoning commission.  The commission shall recommend boundaries for the original zoning districts and appropriate zoning regulations for each district.  If the municipality has a municipal planning commission at the time of implementation of this subchapter, the governing body may appoint that commission to serve as the zoning commission.
    
    (b)  The zoning commission shall make a preliminary report and hold at least one public hearing on that report before submitting a final report to the governing body.  The governing body may not hold a public hearing until it receives the final report of the zoning commission unless the governing body by ordinance provides that a public hearing is to be held, after the notice required by Section [211.006](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=211.006)(a), jointly with a public hearing required to be held by the zoning commission.  In either case, the governing body may not take action on the matter until it receives the final report of the zoning commission.
    
    (c)  Before the 10th day before the hearing date, written notice of each public hearing before the zoning commission on a proposed change in a zoning classification shall be sent to each owner, as indicated by the most recently approved municipal tax roll, of real property within 200 feet of the property on which the change in classification is proposed.  The notice may be served by its deposit in the municipality, properly addressed with postage paid, in the United States mail.  If the property within 200 feet of the property on which the change is proposed is located in territory annexed to the municipality and is not included on the most recently approved municipal tax roll, the notice shall be given in the manner provided by Section [211.006](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=211.006)(a).
    
    (c-1)  Before the 10th day before the hearing date, written notice of each public hearing before the zoning commission on a proposed change in a zoning classification affecting residential or multifamily zoning shall be sent to each school district in which the property for which the change in classification is proposed is located.  The notice may be served by its deposit in the municipality, properly addressed with postage paid, in the United States mail.
    
    (c-2)  Subsection (c-1) does not apply to a municipality the majority of which is located in a county with a population of 100,000 or less, except that such a municipality must give notice under Subsection (c-1) to a school district that has territory in the municipality and requests the notice. For purposes of this subsection, if a school district makes a request for notice under Subsection (c-1), the municipality must give notice of each public hearing held following the request unless the school district requests that no further notices under Subsection (c-1) be given to the school district.
    
    (d)  The governing body of a home-rule municipality may, by a two-thirds vote, prescribe the type of notice to be given of the time and place of a public hearing held jointly by the governing body and the zoning commission.  If notice requirements are prescribed under this subsection, the notice requirements prescribed by Subsections (b) and (c) and by Section [211.006](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=211.006)(a) do not apply.
    
    (e)  If a general-law municipality exercises zoning authority without the appointment of a zoning commission, any reference in a law to a municipal zoning commission or planning commission means the governing body of the municipality.

    (2)  hear and decide special exceptions to the terms of a zoning ordinance when the ordinance requires the board to do so;  
    
    (3)  authorize in specific cases a variance from the terms of a zoning ordinance if the variance is not contrary to the public interest and, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of the ordinance is observed and substantial justice is done;  and
    
    (4)  hear and decide other matters authorized by an ordinance adopted under this subchapter.

    (2)  compliance would result in a loss to the lot on which the structure is located of at least 25 percent of the area on which development may physically occur;
    
    (3)  compliance would result in the structure not being in compliance with a requirement of a municipal ordinance, building code, or other requirement;
    
    (4)  compliance would result in the unreasonable encroachment on an adjacent property or easement; or
    
    (5)  the municipality considers the structure to be a nonconforming structure.
    
    (c)  The concurring vote of 75 percent of the members of the board is necessary to:
    
    (1)  reverse an order, requirement, decision, or determination of an administrative official;
    
    (2)  decide in favor of an applicant on a matter on which the board is required to pass under a zoning ordinance;  or

    (B) is not limited to determining whether a decision of the board meets the requirements of this chapter or other applicable law. 
    
    (l)  A person seeking to continue a nonconforming use under Subsection (d)(2) who appeals the decision of the municipality or board of adjustment may continue to use the property in the same manner pending the appeal unless an official of the body that made the decision shows cause to stay the nonconforming use by certifying in writing to the board of adjustment or court with jurisdiction over the appeal facts supporting the official's opinion that continued nonconforming use of the property would cause imminent peril to life or property.  On a showing of cause the board of adjustment or court with jurisdiction over the appeal may, after notice to the official, grant a restraining order to stay continued nonconforming use of the property. 
    
    (m)  If the board of adjustment or court with jurisdiction over an appeal determines that an owner or lessee is entitled to:
    
    (1)  a payment under this section in an amount different than the amount determined by the municipality under Subsection (d)(1), the board of adjustment or court shall order, as applicable:
    
    (A)  additional payment to the owner or lessee; or
    
    (B)  the owner or lessee to reimburse the municipality; or
    
    (2)  an amount of time to operate the nonconforming use that is different than the amount of time initially received under Subsection (d)(2), the board of adjustment or court shall order the municipality to allow an owner or lessee to continue the nonconforming use for additional or less time.
    
    (n)  An owner or lessee may waive the rights and remedies provided by this section by providing to the municipality a written waiver. 
    
    (o)  This section does not apply to a nonconforming use that has been intentionally abandoned for at least six months. 
    
    (p)  A municipality's immunity from suit and governmental immunity from liability are waived for purposes of an action brought by a property owner or lessee to enforce the rights and remedies under this section.
