As the terms of the members of the previously existing commission expire, the chief executive shall appoint members as prescribed by this section.

The petition must be filed within 10 days after the date the final commission decision:
    
    (1)  is sent to the fire fighter or police officer by certified mail;  or
    
    (2)  is personally received by the fire fighter or police officer or by that person's designee.

The examinations are open to each person who makes a proper application and meets the requirements prescribed by this chapter.
    
    (b)  An eligibility list for a beginning position in the fire or police department may be created only as a result of a competitive examination held in the presence of each applicant for the position, except as provided by Subsections (d), (e), and (l).

    (1)  take the same examination;  and
    
    (2)  be examined in the presence of other applicants for that eligibility list.
    
    (f)  An additional five points shall be added to the examination grade of an applicant who served in the United States armed forces, received an honorable discharge, and made a passing grade on the examination.
    
    (g)  An applicant may not take the examination for a particular eligibility list more than once.
    
    (h)  The commission shall keep each eligibility list for a beginning position in effect for a period of not less than six months or more than 12 months, unless the names of all applicants on the list have been referred to the appropriate department.  The commission shall determine the length of the period.  The commission shall give new examinations at times the commission considers necessary to provide required staffing for scheduled fire or police training academies.
    
    (i)  The grade to be placed on the eligibility list for each applicant shall be computed by adding an applicant's points under Subsection (f), if any, to the applicant's grade on the written examination.  Each applicant's grade on the written examination is based on a maximum grade of 100 percent and is determined entirely by the correctness of the applicant's answers to the questions.  The minimum passing grade on the examination is 70 percent.  An applicant must pass the examination to be placed on an eligibility list.
    
    (j)  Notwithstanding Subsection (i), each applicant who is either a natural-born or adopted child of a fire fighter who previously suffered a line-of-duty death while covered by this chapter shall be ranked at the top of any eligibility list in which said applicant receives a minimum passing grade on that respective eligibility exam.  The deceased fire fighter's applicant child must otherwise satisfy all of the requirements for eligibility for a beginning position in a fire department contained in this chapter.  This commission shall promulgate rules to identify and verify each applicant's eligibility for applicability of this subsection.
    
    (k)  This section does not apply to a police department located in a municipality with a population of 1.5 million or more.
    
    (l)  In a municipality with a population of more than 1.4 million and less than 2 million, an examination for a beginning position in the fire department may include testing instruments to be used in addition to the written examination in the establishment of the initial eligibility list.

    Sec. 143.027.  PROBATIONARY PERIOD.  (a)  A person appointed to a beginning position in the fire or police department must serve a probationary period of one year beginning on that person's date of employment as a fire fighter, police officer, or academy trainee.  In a municipality with a population of less than 1.9 million, the commission by rule may extend the probationary period by not more than six months for a person who:
    
    (1)  is not employed by a department in which a collective bargaining agreement or a meet-and-confer agreement currently exists or previously existed; and
    
    (2)  is required to attend a basic training academy for initial certification by the Texas Commission on Fire Protection or the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement.
    
    (b)  During a fire fighter's or police officer's probationary period, the department head shall discharge the person and remove the person from the payroll if the person's appointment was not regular or was not made in accordance with this chapter or the commission rules.
    
    (c)  During a fire fighter's or police officer's probationary period, the person may not be prohibited from joining or required to join an employee organization.  Joining or not joining an employee organization is not a ground for retaining or not retaining a fire fighter or police officer serving a probationary period.
    
    (d)  A fire fighter or police officer who was appointed in substantial compliance with this chapter and who serves the entire probationary period automatically becomes a full-fledged civil service employee and has full civil service protection.

    Sec. 143.032.  PROMOTIONAL EXAMINATION PROCEDURE.

Unless a different procedure is adopted under an alternate promotional system as provided by Section [143.035](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=143.035), the examinations shall be held substantially as prescribed by this section.
    
    (b)(1)  Each eligible promotional candidate shall be given an identical examination in the presence of the other eligible promotional candidates, except that an eligible promotional candidate who is serving on active military duty outside of this state or in a location that is not within reasonable geographic proximity to the location where the examination is being administered is entitled to take the examination outside of the presence of and at a different time than the other candidates and may be allowed to take an examination that is not identical to the examination administered to the other candidates.
    
    (2)  The commission may adopt rules under Subsection (a) providing for the efficient administration of promotional examinations to eligible promotional candidates who are members of the armed forces serving on active military duty.  In adopting the rules, the commission shall ensure that the administration of the examination will not result in unnecessary interference with any ongoing military effort.  The rules shall require that:
    
    (A)  at the discretion of the administering entity, an examination that is not identical to the examination administered to other eligible promotional candidates may be administered to an eligible promotional candidate who is serving on active military duty; and
    
    (B)  if a candidate serving on active military duty takes a promotional examination outside the presence of other candidates and passes the examination, the candidate's name shall be included in the eligibility list of names of promotional candidates who took and passed the examination nearest in time to the time at which the candidate on active military duty took the examination.
    
    (c)  The examination must be entirely in writing and may not in any part consist of an oral interview.
    
    (d)  The examination questions must test the knowledge of the eligible promotional candidates about information and facts and must be based on:
    
    (1)  the duties of the position for which the examination is held;
    
    (2)  material that is of reasonably current publication and that has been made reasonably available to each member of the fire or police department involved in the examination; and
    
    (3)  any study course given by the departmental schools of instruction.
    
    (e)  The examination questions must be taken from the sources posted as prescribed by Section [143.029](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=143.029)(a).  Fire fighters or police officers may suggest source materials for the examinations.
    
    (f)  The examination questions must be prepared and composed so that the grading of the examination can be promptly completed immediately after the examination is over.
    
    (g)  The director is responsible for the preparation and security of each promotional examination.  The fairness of the competitive promotional examination is the responsibility of the commission, the director, and each municipal employee involved in the preparation or administration of the examination.

    (1)  reveals a part of a promotional examination to an unauthorized person;  or
    
    (2)  receives from an authorized or unauthorized person a part of a promotional examination for unfair personal gain or advantage.

    Sec. 143.033.  PROMOTIONAL EXAMINATION GRADES.  (a)  The grading of each promotional examination shall begin when one eligible promotional candidate completes the examination.  As the eligible promotional candidates finish the examination, the examinations shall be graded at the examination location and in the presence of any candidate who wants to remain during the grading.
    
    (b)  Each police officer is entitled to receive one point for each year of seniority as a classified police officer in that department, with a maximum of 10 points.  Each fire fighter is entitled to receive one point for each year of seniority in that department, with a maximum of 10 points.
    
    (c)  Unless a different procedure is adopted under an alternate promotional system as provided by Section [143.035](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=143.035), the grade that must be placed on the eligibility list for each police officer or fire fighter shall be computed by adding the applicant's points for seniority to the applicant's grade on the written examination, but for a fire fighter applicant only if the applicant scores a passing grade on the written examination.  Each applicant's grade on the written examination is based on a maximum grade of 100 points and is determined entirely by the correctness of the applicant's answers to the questions.  The passing grade in a municipality with a population of 1.5 million or more is prescribed by Section [143.108](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=143.108).  In a municipality with a population of less than 1.5 million, all police officer applicants who receive a grade of at least 70 points shall be determined to have passed the examination and all fire fighter applicants who receive a grade on the written examination of at least 70 points shall be determined to have passed the examination.  If a tie score occurs, the commission shall determine a method to break the tie.
    
    (d)  Within 24 hours after a promotional examination is held, the commission shall post the individual raw test scores on a bulletin board located in the main lobby of the city hall.

    Sec. 143.035.  ALTERNATE PROMOTIONAL SYSTEM IN POLICE DEPARTMENT.  (a)  This section does not apply to a municipality that has adopted The Fire and Police Employee Relations Act (Article 5154c-1, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes).
    
    (b)  On the recommendation of the head of the police department and a majority vote of the sworn police officers in the department, the commission may adopt an alternate promotional system to select persons to occupy nonentry level positions other than positions that are filled by appointment by the department head.  The promotional system must comply with the requirements prescribed by this section.
    
    (c)  The commission shall order the director to conduct an election and to submit the revised promotional system either to all sworn police officers within the rank immediately below the classification for which the promotional examination is to be administered or to all sworn police officers in the department.
    
    (d)  The director shall hold the election on or after the 30th day after the date notice of the election is posted at the department.  The election shall be conducted throughout each regular work shift at an accessible location within the department during a 24-hour period.
    
    (e)  The ballot shall contain the specific amendment to the promotional procedure.  Each sworn police officer shall be given the opportunity to vote by secret ballot "for" or "against" the amendment.
    
    (f)  The revised promotional system must be approved by a majority vote of the sworn police officers voting.  A defeated promotional system amendment may not be placed on a ballot for a vote by the sworn police officers for at least 12 months after the date the prior election was held, but this provision does not apply if the head of the department recommends a different proposal to the commission.
    
    (g)  The commission shall canvass the votes within 30 days after the date the election is held.  An appeal alleging election irregularity must be filed with the commission within five working days after the date the election closes.  If approved by the sworn police officers, the promotional system amendment becomes effective after all election disputes have been ruled on and the election votes have been canvassed by the commission.
    
    (h)  At any time after an alternate promotional system has been adopted under this section and has been in effect for at least 180 days, the department head may petition the commission to terminate the alternate system, and the commission shall terminate the alternate system.
    
    (i)  At any time after an alternate promotional system has been adopted under this section and has been in effect for at least 180 days, a petition signed by at least 35 percent of the sworn police officers may be submitted to the commission asking that the alternate promotional system be reconsidered.  If a petition is submitted, the commission shall, within 60 days after the date the petition is filed, hold an election as prescribed by this section.  If a majority of those voting vote to terminate, the commission shall terminate the alternate promotional system.
    
    (j)  If the alternate system is terminated, an additional list may not be created under the alternate system.
    
    (k)  A promotional list may not be created if an election under this section is pending.  An existing eligibility list, whether created under the system prescribed by this chapter or created under an alternate system adopted under this section, may not be terminated before or extended beyond its expiration date.  A person promoted under an alternate system has the same rights and the same status as a person promoted under this chapter even if the alternate system is later terminated.

    Sec. 143.036.  PROCEDURE FOR MAKING PROMOTIONAL APPOINTMENTS.  (a)  When a vacancy occurs in a nonentry position that is not appointed by the department head as provided by Sections [143.014](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=143.014) and [143.102](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=143.102), the vacancy shall be filled as prescribed by this section and Section [143.108](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=143.108), as applicable.  A vacancy in a fire fighter position described by this subsection occurs on the date the position is vacated by:
    
    (1)  resignation;
    
    (2)  retirement;
    
    (3)  death;
    
    (4)  promotion; or
    
    (5)  issuance of an indefinite suspension in accordance with Section [143.052](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=143.052)(b).
    
    (b)  If an eligibility list for the position to be filled exists on the date the vacancy occurs, the director, on request by the department head, shall certify to the department head the names of the three persons having the highest grades on that eligibility list.  The commission shall certify the names within 10 days after the date the commission is notified of the vacancy.  If fewer than three names remain on the eligibility list or if only one or two eligible promotional candidates passed the promotional examination, each name on the list must be submitted to the department head.
    
    (c)  In a municipality with a population of less than 1.5 million, the commission shall submit names from an existing eligibility list to the department head until the vacancy is filled or the list is exhausted.
    
    (d)  If an eligibility list does not exist on the date a vacancy occurs or a new position is created, the commission shall hold an examination to create a new eligibility list within 90 days after the date the vacancy occurs or a new position is created.
    
    (e)  If an eligibility list exists on the date a vacancy occurs, the department head shall fill the vacancy by permanent appointment from the eligibility list furnished by the commission within 60 days after the date the vacancy occurs.  If an eligibility list does not exist, the department head shall fill the vacancy by permanent appointment from an eligibility list that the commission shall provide within 90 days after the date the vacancy occurs.  This subsection does not apply in a municipality with a population of 1.5 million or more.
    
    (f)  Unless the department head has a valid reason for not appointing the person, the department head shall appoint the eligible promotional candidate having the highest grade on the eligibility list.  If the department head has a valid reason for not appointing the eligible promotional candidate having the highest grade, the department head shall personally discuss the reason with the person being bypassed before appointing another person.  The department head shall also file the reason in writing with the commission and shall provide the person with a copy of the written notice.  On application of the bypassed eligible promotional candidate, the reason the department head did not appoint that person is subject to review by the commission or, on the written request of the person being bypassed, by an independent third party hearing examiner under Section [143.057](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=143.057).
    
    (g)  If a person is bypassed, the person's name is returned to its place on the eligibility list and shall be resubmitted to the department head if a vacancy occurs.

    Sec. 143.045.  ACCUMULATION AND PAYMENT OF SICK LEAVE.  (a)  A permanent or temporary fire fighter or police officer is allowed sick leave with pay accumulated at the rate of 1-1/4 full working days for each full month employed in a calendar year, so as to total 15 working days to a person's credit each 12 months.
    
    (b)  A fire fighter or police officer may accumulate sick leave without limit and may use the leave if unable to work because of a bona fide illness.  If an ill fire fighter or police officer exhausts the sick leave and can conclusively prove that the illness was incurred in the performance of duties, an extension of sick leave shall be granted.
    
    (c)  Except as otherwise provided by Section [143.116](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=143.116), a fire fighter or police officer who leaves the classified service for any reason is entitled to receive in a lump-sum payment the full amount of the person's salary for accumulated sick leave if the person has accumulated not more than 90 days of sick leave.  If a fire fighter or police officer has accumulated more than 90 working days of sick leave, the person's employer may limit payment to the amount that the person would have received if the person had been allowed to use 90 days of accumulated sick leave during the last six months of employment.  The lump-sum payment is computed by compensating the fire fighter or police officer for the accumulated time at the highest permanent pay classification for which the person was eligible during the last six months of employment.  The fire fighter or police officer is paid for the same period for which the person would have been paid if the person had taken the sick leave but does not include additional holidays and any sick leave or vacation time that the person might have accrued during the 90 days.
    
    (d)  To facilitate the settlement of the accounts of deceased fire fighters and police officers, all unpaid compensation, including all accumulated sick leave, due at the time of death to an active fire fighter or police officer who dies as a result of a line-of-duty injury or illness, shall be paid to the persons in the first applicable category of the following prioritized list:
    
    (1)  to the beneficiary or beneficiaries the fire fighter or police officer designated in writing to receive the compensation and filed with the commission before the person's death;
    
    (2)  to the fire fighter's or police officer's widow or widower;
    
    (3)  to the fire fighter's or police officer's child or children and to the descendants of a deceased child, by representation;
    
    (4)  to the fire fighter's or police officer's parents or to their survivors; or
    
    (5)  to the properly appointed legal representative of the fire fighter's or police officer's estate, or in the absence of a representative, to the person determined to be entitled to the payment under the state law of descent and distribution.
    
    (e)  Payment of compensation to a person in accordance with Subsection (d) is a bar to recovery by another person.

The suspension may be for a reasonable period not to exceed 15 calendar days or for an indefinite period.  An indefinite suspension is equivalent to dismissal from the department.
    
    (c)  If the department head suspends a fire fighter or police officer, the department head shall, within 120 hours after the hour of suspension, file a written statement with the commission giving the reasons for the suspension.  The department head shall immediately deliver a copy of the statement in person to the suspended fire fighter or police officer.
    
    (d)  The copy of the written statement must inform the suspended fire fighter or police officer that if the person wants to appeal to the commission, the person must file a written appeal with the commission within 10 days after the date the person receives the copy of the statement.
    
    (e)  The written statement filed by the department head with the commission must point out each civil service rule alleged to have been violated by the suspended fire fighter or police officer and must describe the alleged acts of the person that the department head contends are in violation of the civil service rules.  It is not sufficient for the department head merely to refer to the provisions of the rules alleged to have been violated.
    
    (f)  If the department head does not specifically point out in the written statement the act or acts of the fire fighter or police officer that allegedly violated the civil service rules, the commission shall promptly reinstate the person.
    
    (g)  If offered by the department head, the fire fighter or police officer may agree in writing to voluntarily accept, with no right of appeal, a suspension of 16 to 90 calendar days for the violation of a civil service rule.  The fire fighter or police officer must accept the offer within five working days after the date the offer is made.  If the person refuses the offer and wants to appeal to the commission, the person must file a written appeal with the commission within 15 days after the date the person receives the copy of the written statement of suspension.
    
    (h)  In the original written statement and charges and in any hearing conducted under this chapter, the department head may not complain of an act that occurred earlier than the 180th day preceding the date the department head suspends the fire fighter or police officer. If the act is allegedly related to criminal activity including the violation of a federal, state, or local law for which the fire fighter or police officer is subject to a criminal penalty, the department head may not complain of an act that is discovered earlier than the 180th day preceding the date the department head suspends the fire fighter or police officer.  The department head must allege that the act complained of is related to criminal activity.

    (b)  If a suspended fire fighter or police officer appeals the suspension to the commission, the commission shall hold a hearing and render a decision in writing within 30 days after the date it receives notice of appeal.  The suspended person and the commission may agree to postpone the hearing for a definite period.
    
    (c)  In a hearing conducted under this section, the department head is restricted to the department head's original written statement and charges, which may not be amended.
    
    (d)  The commission may deliberate the decision in closed session but may not consider evidence that was not presented at the hearing.  The commission shall vote in open session.

    (1)  permanently dismissed from the fire or police department;

    (3)  restored to the person's former position or status in the department's classified service.
    
    (f)  If the commission finds that the period of disciplinary suspension should be reduced, the commission may order a reduction in the period of suspension.  If the suspended fire fighter or police officer is restored to the position or class of service from which the person was suspended, the fire fighter or police officer is entitled to:
    
    (1)  full compensation for the actual time lost as a result of the suspension at the rate of pay provided for the position or class of service from which the person was suspended;  and
    
    (2)  restoration of or credit for any other benefits lost as a result of the suspension, including sick leave, vacation leave, and service credit in a retirement system.  Standard payroll deductions, if any, for retirement and other benefits restored shall be made from the compensation paid, and the municipality shall make its standard corresponding contributions, if any, to the retirement system or other applicable benefit systems.
    
    (g)  The commission may suspend or dismiss a fire fighter or police officer only for violation of civil service rules and only after a finding by the commission of the truth of specific charges against the fire fighter or police officer.

    (b)  The department head must include in the recommendation for demotion the reasons the department head recommends the demotion and a request that the commission order the demotion.  The department head must immediately furnish a copy of the recommendation in person to the affected fire fighter or police officer.
    
    (c)  The commission may refuse to grant the request for demotion.  If the commission believes that probable cause exists for ordering the demotion, the commission shall give the fire fighter or police officer written notice to appear before the commission for a public hearing at a time and place specified in the notice.  The commission shall give the notice before the 10th day before the date the hearing will be held.
    
    (d)  The fire fighter or police officer is entitled to a full and complete public hearing, and the commission may not demote a fire fighter or police officer without that public hearing.

    (b)  In this section, "uncompensated duty" means days of police work without pay that are in addition to regular or normal work days.
    
    (c)  The head of the police department may assign a police officer under his jurisdiction or supervision to uncompensated duty.  The department head may not impose uncompensated duty unless the police officer agrees to accept the duty.  If the police officer agrees to accept uncompensated duty, the department head shall give the person a written statement that specifies the date or dates on which the person will perform uncompensated duty.
    
    (d)  Uncompensated duty may be in place of or in combination with a period of disciplinary suspension without pay.  If uncompensated duty is combined with a disciplinary suspension, the total number of uncompensated days may not exceed 15.
    
    (e)  A police officer may not earn or accrue any wage, salary, or benefit arising from length of service while the person is suspended or performing uncompensated duty.  The days on which a police officer performs assigned uncompensated duty may not be taken into consideration in determining eligibility for a promotional examination.  A disciplinary suspension does not constitute a break in a continuous position or in service in the department in determining eligibility for a promotional examination.
    
    (f)  Except as provided by this section, a police officer who performs assigned uncompensated duty retains all rights and privileges of the person's position in the police department and of the person's employment by the municipality.

    Sec. 143.056.  PROCEDURES AFTER FELONY INDICTMENT OR MISDEMEANOR COMPLAINT.  (a)  If a fire fighter or police officer is indicted for a felony or officially charged with the commission of a Class A or B misdemeanor, the department head may temporarily suspend the person with or without pay for a period not to exceed 30 days after the date of final disposition of the specified felony indictment or misdemeanor complaint.
    
    (b)  The department head shall notify the suspended fire fighter or police officer in writing that the person is being temporarily suspended for a specific period with or without pay and that the temporary suspension is not intended to reflect an opinion on the merits of the indictment or complaint.
    
    (c)  If the action directly related to the felony indictment or misdemeanor complaint occurred or was discovered on or after the 180th day before the date of the indictment or complaint, the department head may, within 30 days after the date of final disposition of the indictment or complaint, bring a charge against the fire fighter or police officer for a violation of civil service rules.
    
    (d)  A fire fighter or police officer indicted for a felony or officially charged with the commission of a Class A or B misdemeanor who has also been charged by the department head with civil service violations directly related to the indictment or complaint may delay the civil service hearing for not more than 30 days after the date of the final disposition of the indictment or complaint.
    
    (e)  If the department head temporarily suspends a fire fighter or police officer under this section and the fire fighter or police officer is not found guilty of the indictment or complaint in a court of competent jurisdiction, the fire fighter or police officer may appeal to the commission or to a hearing examiner for recovery of back pay.  The commission or hearing examiner may award all or part of the back pay or reject the appeal.
    
    (f)  Acquittal or dismissal of an indictment or a complaint does not mean that a fire fighter or police officer has not violated civil service rules and does not negate the charges that may have been or may be brought against the fire fighter or police officer by the department head.
    
    (g)  Conviction of a felony is cause for dismissal, and conviction of a Class A or B misdemeanor may be cause for disciplinary action or indefinite suspension.
    
    (h)  The department head may order an indefinite suspension based on an act classified as a felony or a Class A or B misdemeanor after the 180-day period following the date of the discovery of the act by the department if the department head considers delay to be necessary to protect a criminal investigation of the person's conduct.  If the department head intends to order an indefinite suspension after the 180-day period, the department head must file with the attorney general a statement describing the criminal investigation and its objectives within 180 days after the date the act complained of occurred.

    Sec. 143.057.  HEARING EXAMINERS.  (a)  In addition to the other notice requirements prescribed by this chapter, the written notice for a promotional bypass or the letter of disciplinary action, as applicable, issued to a fire fighter or police officer must state that in an appeal of an indefinite suspension, a suspension, a promotional bypass, or a recommended demotion, the appealing fire fighter or police officer may elect to appeal to an independent third party hearing examiner instead of to the commission.  The letter must also state that if the fire fighter or police officer elects to appeal to a hearing examiner, the person waives all rights to appeal to a district court except as provided by Subsection (j).
    
    (b)  To exercise the choice of appealing to a hearing examiner, the appealing fire fighter or police officer must submit to the director a written request as part of the original notice of appeal required under this chapter stating the person's decision to appeal to an independent third party hearing examiner.
    
    (c)  The hearing examiner's decision is final and binding on all parties.  If the fire fighter or police officer decides to appeal to an independent third party hearing examiner, the person automatically waives all rights to appeal to a district court except as provided by Subsection (j).
    
    (d)  If the appealing fire fighter or police officer chooses to appeal to a hearing examiner, the fire fighter or police officer and the department head, or their designees, shall first attempt to agree on the selection of an impartial hearing examiner.  If the parties do not agree on the selection of a hearing examiner on or within 10 days after the date the appeal is filed, the director shall immediately request a list of seven qualified neutral arbitrators from the American Arbitration Association or the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, or their successors in function.  The fire fighter or police officer and the department head, or their designees, may agree on one of the seven neutral arbitrators on the list.  If they do not agree within five working days after the date they received the list, each party or the party's designee shall alternate striking a name from the list and the name remaining is the hearing examiner.  The parties or their designees shall agree on a date for the hearing.
    
    (e)  The appeal hearing shall begin as soon as the hearing examiner can be scheduled.  If the hearing examiner cannot begin the hearing within 45 calendar days after the date of selection, the fire fighter or police officer may, within two days after learning of that fact, call for the selection of a new hearing examiner using the procedure prescribed by Subsection (d).
    
    (f)  In each hearing conducted under this section, the hearing examiner has the same duties and powers as the commission, including the right to issue subpoenas.
    
    (g)  In a hearing conducted under this section, the parties may agree to an expedited hearing procedure.  Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, in an expedited procedure the hearing examiner shall render a decision on the appeal within 10 days after the date the hearing ended.
    
    (h)  In an appeal that does not involve an expedited hearing procedure, the hearing examiner shall make a reasonable effort to render a decision on the appeal within 30 days after the date the hearing ends or the briefs are filed.  The hearing examiner's inability to meet the time requirements imposed by this section does not affect the hearing examiner's jurisdiction, the validity of the disciplinary action, or the hearing examiner's final decision.
    
    (i)  The hearing examiner's fees and expenses are shared equally by the appealing fire fighter or police officer and by the department.  The costs of a witness are paid by the party who calls the witness.
    
    (j)  A district court may hear an appeal of a hearing examiner's award only on the grounds that the arbitration panel was without jurisdiction or exceeded its jurisdiction or that the order was procured by fraud, collusion, or other unlawful means.  An appeal must be brought in the district court having jurisdiction in the municipality in which the fire or police department is located.

    (e)  On reinstatement, the fire fighter or police officer shall receive full seniority credit for the time spent in the military service.
    
    (f)  If the reinstatement of a fire fighter or police officer who received a military leave of absence causes a surplus in the rank to which the fire fighter or police officer was reinstated, the fire fighter or police officer who has the least seniority in the position shall be returned to the position immediately below the position to which the returning fire fighter or police officer was reinstated.  If a fire fighter or police officer is returned to a lower position in grade or compensation under this subsection without charges being filed against the person for violation of civil service rules, the fire fighter or police officer shall be placed on a position reinstatement list in order of seniority.  Appointments from the reinstatement list shall be made in order of seniority. A person who is not on the reinstatement list may not be appointed to a position to which the list applies until the list is exhausted.

    (h)  In addition to other procedures prescribed by this section, a fire fighter or police officer may, without restriction as to the amount of time, voluntarily substitute for a fire fighter or police officer described by Sections [143.075](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=143.075)(b)(1) and (2) who has been called to active federal military duty for a period expected to last 12 months or longer.

    Sec. 143.1015.  COMMISSION APPEAL PROCEDURE;  SUBPOENA REQUEST.  (a)  An appeal by a fire fighter or police officer to the commission from an action for which an appeal or review is provided by this chapter is sufficient if the fire fighter or police officer files it with the commission within 15 days after the date the action occurred.  In an appeal provided by this chapter the commission shall render a decision in writing within 60 days after it received the notice of appeal, unless the provisions of Section [143.1017](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=143.1017)(d) have been invoked by the fire fighter or police officer.  If the commission does not render a decision in writing within 60 days after the date it receives notice of the appeal, the commission shall sustain the fire fighter's or police officer's appeal.
    
    (b)  On or before the 15th day before the date the appeal hearing will be held, the commission shall notify the fire fighter or police officer of the date on which the commission will hold the hearing.

    (e)  The hearing relating to the reasons for the fire fighter's or police officer's subpoena request shall be held on the date set for the original appeal hearing.  If the commission overrules the subpoena request at the hearing:
    
    (1)  the commission may hear the fire fighter's or police officer's appeal on that date; or
    
    (2)  if the commission finds that justice is served by a continuance, the commission shall:
    
    (A)  reschedule the hearing to the commission's next regularly scheduled meeting; and
    
    (B)  give the fire fighter or police officer 15 days notice of that date.
    
    (f)  If the commission sustains the fire fighter's or police officer's subpoena request at the hearing, the commission shall:
    
    (1)  reschedule the appeal hearing date to the commission's next regularly scheduled meeting; and
    
    (2)  give the fire fighter or police officer 15 days notice of that date.

    (i)  A municipal employee who is subpoenaed to appear in any appeal of a disciplinary decision is entitled to applicable pay for the time the employee is required to be present at the hearing.  Witnesses whose testimony relates primarily to the character or reputation of the employee shall be limited by the hearing examiner or commission if the testimony is repetitious or unduly prolongs the hearing.  If the hearing examiner or commission limits the number of character or reputation witnesses, additional witness statements may be presented by affidavit.  The character witnesses are not entitled to applicable pay for the time they are required to be present at the hearing.

    Sec. 143.1016.  HEARING EXAMINERS.  (a)  In addition to the other notice requirements prescribed by this chapter, the letter of disciplinary action issued to a fire fighter or police officer must state that in an appeal of an indefinite suspension, a suspension, a promotional pass over, or a recommended demotion, the appealing fire fighter or police officer may elect to appeal to an independent third party hearing examiner instead of to the commission.  The letter must also state that if the fire fighter or police officer elects to appeal to a hearing examiner, the person waives all rights to appeal to a district court except as provided by Subsection (j).
    
    (b)  To exercise the choice of appealing to a hearing examiner, the appealing fire fighter or police officer must submit to the director a written request as part of the original notice of appeal required under this chapter stating the person's decision to appeal to an independent third party hearing examiner.
    
    (c)  The hearing examiner's decision is final and binding on all parties.  If the fire fighter or police officer decides to appeal to an independent third party hearing examiner, the person automatically waives all rights to appeal to a district court except as provided by Subsection (j).
    
    (d)  If the appealing fire fighter or police officer chooses to appeal to a hearing examiner, the fire fighter or police officer and the department head or their designees shall first attempt to agree on the selection of an impartial hearing examiner.  If the parties do not agree on the selection of a hearing examiner on or within 10 days after the date the appeal is filed and no motion to consolidate is filed under Subsection (k) of this section, the director shall on the next work day following notice that the parties have failed to agree on a selection of a hearing examiner request a list of seven qualified neutral arbitrators from the American Arbitration Association or the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service or their successors in function.  The fire fighter or police officer and the department head or their designees may agree on one of the seven neutral arbitrators on the list.  If they do not agree within 25 days after the date the appeal was filed, each party or the party's designee shall on the 25th day after the appeal was filed alternate striking a name from the list and the name remaining is the hearing examiner.  In the event that the 25th day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, then the parties shall strike the list the next work day.  The parties or their designees shall agree on a date for the hearing that is within the time period prescribed by Subsection (e).  In the event that the director does not request the list of seven qualified neutral arbitrators within the time prescribed by this subsection or the department head or his designee fails to strike the list within the time prescribed by this subsection, the fire fighter or police officer or his designee shall select the arbitrator from the list provided.  In the event that the fire fighter or police officer or his designee fails to strike the list within the time prescribed by this subsection, the department head or his designee shall select the arbitrator from the list provided.
    
    (e)  The appeal hearing must begin within 60 days after the date the appeal is filed and shall begin as soon as the hearing examiner can be scheduled.  If the hearing examiner cannot begin the hearing within 45 calendar days after the date of selection, the fire fighter or police officer may, within two days after learning of that fact, call for the selection of a new hearing examiner using the procedure prescribed by Subsection (d).  If the appeal hearing is not begun within 60 days after the date the appeal is filed, the indefinite suspension, suspension, promotional pass over, or recommended demotion is upheld and the appeal is withdrawn if the fire fighter or police officer is not ready to proceed, and the appeal is sustained if the department head is not ready to proceed.  In computing the 60-day period, a period of delay not to exceed 30 calendar days because of a continuance granted at the request of the department head or his representative or the fire fighter or police officer or his representative on good cause being shown, or because of the unavoidable unavailability of the hearing examiner on the date of the hearing, or because of the pendency of a motion to consolidate with another hearing as provided in Subsection (k) of this section is excluded.  In no event may a hearing examiner grant a continuance beyond 30 days in an indefinite suspension.  A hearing examiner may grant a continuance beyond the 30-day period upon good cause being shown in a disciplinary suspension unless the fire fighter or police officer has another disciplinary action pending.
    
    (f)  In each hearing conducted under this section, the hearing examiner has the same duties and powers as the commission, including the right to issue subpoenas.
    
    (g)  In a hearing conducted under this section, the parties may agree to an expedited hearing procedure.  Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, in an expedited procedure the hearing examiner shall render a decision on the appeal within 10 days after the date the hearing closed.
    
    (h)  In an appeal that does not involve an expedited hearing procedure, the hearing examiner shall make a reasonable effort to render a decision on the appeal within 30 days after the date the hearing ends or the briefs are filed.  The hearing examiner's inability to meet the time requirements imposed by this section does not affect the hearing examiner's jurisdiction, the validity of the disciplinary action, or the hearing examiner's final decision.
    
    (i)  The hearing examiner's fees and expenses are shared equally by the appealing fire fighter or police officer and by the department.  The costs of a witness are paid by the party who calls the witness.
    
    (j)  A district court may hear an appeal of a hearing examiner's award only on the grounds that the arbitration panel was without jurisdiction or exceeded its jurisdiction or that the order was procured by fraud, collusion, or other unlawful means.  If the basis for the appeal of the hearing examiner's award is based on the grounds that the arbitration panel was without jurisdiction or exceeded its jurisdiction, the petition must be filed in district court within 10 days of the hearing examiner's decision.  An appeal must be brought in the district court having jurisdiction in the municipality in which the fire or police department is located.  In the event the municipality is located in more than one county then the suit must be brought in the county having the majority of the population of the municipality.
    
    (k)  In an appeal of an indefinite suspension, a suspension, a promotional pass over, or a recommended demotion, each appealing fire fighter or police officer or the appealing fire fighter's or police officer's representative shall be entitled to the selection of a hearing examiner pursuant to Subsection (d) of this section to hear the case.  The fire fighter, police officer, department head, or a representative of any of those may, within 10 days of the date they received notice of the appeal, file a motion with a copy to the opposing side to consolidate the case with that of one or more other fire fighters or police officers where the charges arise out of the same incident.  The motion to consolidate may be agreed to in writing and filed with the director.  If a motion to consolidate the cases is filed and not agreed to, a hearing examiner shall be chosen pursuant to the provisions of Subsection (d) of this section to hear the motion.  The decision of the hearing examiner shall be final and binding as to the issue of consolidation.  The hearing examiner chosen to hear the motion to consolidate shall not hear the case, and the provisions of Subsection (d) of this section shall be used to choose the hearing examiner with the day the decision is rendered being the equivalent of the date the appeal was filed.

    Sec. 143.1017.  PROCEDURES AFTER FELONY INDICTMENT OR OTHER CRIME OF MORAL TURPITUDE.  (a)  If a fire fighter or police officer is indicted for a felony or officially charged with the commission of any other crime involving moral turpitude, the department head may temporarily suspend the person with or without pay for a period not to exceed 30 days after the date the fire fighter or police officer gives notice of final disposition of the specified felony indictment or any other crime involving moral turpitude.
    
    (b)  The department head shall notify the suspended fire fighter or police officer in writing that the person is being temporarily suspended for a specific period with or without pay and that the temporary suspension is not intended to reflect an opinion on the merits of the indictment or complaint.
    
    (c)  If the action directly related to the felony indictment or misdemeanor complaint occurred or was discovered on or after the 180th day before the date of the indictment or complaint, the department head may, within 60 days after the date of final disposition of the indictment or complaint, bring a charge against the fire fighter or police officer for a violation of civil service rules.
    
    (d)  A fire fighter or police officer indicted for a felony or officially charged with the commission of any other crime involving moral turpitude who has also been charged by the department head with civil service violations directly related to the indictment or complaint may delay the civil service hearing for not more than 30 days after the date of the final disposition of the indictment or complaint.
    
    (e)  If the department head temporarily suspends a fire fighter or police officer under this section and the fire fighter or police officer is not found guilty of the indictment or complaint in a court of competent jurisdiction, the fire fighter or police officer may appeal to the commission or to a hearing examiner for recovery of back pay.  The commission or hearing examiner may award all or part of the back pay or reject the appeal.
    
    (f)  Acquittal or dismissal of an indictment or a complaint does not mean that a fire fighter or police officer has not violated civil service rules and does not negate the charges that may have been or may be brought against the fire fighter or police officer by the department head.
    
    (g)  Final conviction of a felony shall be the basis for dismissal without notice or further proceedings under this Act, and conviction of any other crime involving moral turpitude may be cause for disciplinary action or indefinite suspension.
    
    (h)  The department head may order an indefinite suspension based on an act classified as a felony or any other crime involving moral turpitude after the 180-day period following the date of the discovery of the act by the department if the department head considers delay to be necessary to protect a criminal investigation of the person's conduct.  If the department head intends to order an indefinite suspension after the 180-day period, the department head must file with the attorney general a statement describing the criminal investigation and its objectives within 180 days after the date the act complained of occurred.

Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, it shall not be a violation for either party to file written briefs or written motions in the case if copies were served on the opposing party.
    
    (b)  If the commission, hearing examiner, grievance examiner, or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that a person has violated Subsection (a) on behalf of and with the knowledge of the fire fighter or police officer who filed the appeal, request for a review, or grievance, a ruling shall be entered that dismisses the appeal, review, or grievance.  If the commission, hearing examiner, grievance examiner, or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that a person violated Subsection (a) on behalf of or in favor of the department head or the department head's representative or on behalf of and with the knowledge of a person against whom a grievance was filed, a ruling shall be entered that upholds the position of the fire fighter or police officer that filed the appeal, request for a review, or grievance.
    
    (c)  While any matter subject to a hearing under the grievance procedure of Section [143.130](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=143.130) is pending, the director shall only send the name of the parties to the grievance, the original grievance, the written responses to the grievance, and any documents filed in the case by either party if copies were served upon the opposing party.

    Sec. 143.116.  PAYMENT OF SICK LEAVE ON TERMINATION OF SERVICE.  (a)  A fire fighter or police officer who leaves the classified service for any reason or the beneficiaries of a fire fighter or police officer who dies as a result of a line of duty injury or illness are entitled to receive in a lump-sum payment the full amount of the fire fighter's or police officer's accumulated sick leave as provided by Subsections (b)-(e).
    
    (b)  A fire fighter or police officer hired before September 1, 1985, is entitled to have sick leave accumulated without limit.  Sick leave accumulated before September 1, 1985, is valued at the amount of the fire fighter's or police officer's salary on August 31, 1985.  Sick leave accumulated after September 1, 1985, is valued at the fire fighter's or police officer's average salary in the fiscal year in which the sick leave was accumulated.
    
    (c)  Each day or part of a day of sick leave used by a fire fighter or police officer is charged to that person's earliest acquired unused accumulated day of sick leave, in the same manner as is used in the "first in, first out" accounting principle.

    Sec. 143.117.  DISCIPLINARY SUSPENSIONS.  (a)  The head of the fire or police department may suspend a fire fighter or police officer under the department head's supervision or jurisdiction for disciplinary reasons for a reasonable period not to exceed 15 days.
    
    (b)  The department head may suspend a fire fighter or police officer under this section only if the person violates a civil service rule.  However, the department head may not suspend a fire fighter or police officer later than the 180th day after the date the department discovers or becomes aware of the civil service rule violation.  If, during an investigation of an alleged civil service rule violation, it is alleged that the fire fighter or police officer under investigation committed another violation of a civil service rule connected with the first alleged violation, the 180-day period prescribed by this subsection does not begin again for purposes of a suspension of the fire fighter or police officer if the second violation in question does not involve untruthfulness or refusal to obey a valid order to make a statement, and therefore the department head may not suspend a fire fighter or police officer for the second violation later than the 180th day after the date the department discovers or becomes aware of the original violation.
    
    (c)  If the department head suspends a fire fighter or police officer, the department head shall, within 120 hours after the fire fighter or police officer is notified of the suspension, file a written statement of action with the commission.
    
    (d)  The suspension is void and the fire fighter or police officer is entitled to the person's full pay if:
    
    (1)  the department head fails to file the statement during the required time; or
    
    (2)  the suspension is imposed later than the 180th day after the date the department discovers or becomes aware of the violation that resulted in the suspension.
    
    (e)  A fire fighter or police officer may appeal a disciplinary suspension as prescribed by Sections [143.010](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=143.010) and [143.1015](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=143.1015).

The commission may reverse the department head's decision and instruct the department head to immediately restore the fire fighter or police officer to the person's prior position and to repay the person for any lost wages.
    
    (c)  If the department head refuses to obey a commission order, the provisions of Section [143.120](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=143.120) relating to the department head's refusal apply.

    (c)  The copy of the written statement must inform the suspended fire fighter or police officer that if the person wants to appeal to the commission, the person must file a written appeal with the commission within 10 days after the date the person receives the copy of the statement.
    
    (d)  The written statement filed by the department head with the commission must point out the civil service rule alleged to have been violated by the suspended fire fighter or police officer and must describe the alleged acts of the person that the department head contends are in violation of the civil service rules.  It is not sufficient for the department head merely to refer to the provisions of the rules alleged to have been violated.
    
    (e)  If the department head does not specifically point out in the written statement the act or acts of the fire fighter or police officer that allegedly violated civil service rules, the commission shall promptly reinstate the person.
    
    (f)  If the department head offers a suspension of 16 to 90 calendar days for violation of civil service rules, the fire fighter or police officer may agree in writing to voluntarily accept the suspension, with no right of appeal.  The fire fighter or police officer must accept the offer within five working days after the date the offer is made.  If the person refuses the offer and wants to appeal to the commission, the person must file a written appeal with the commission within 15 days after the date the person receives the copy of the written statement of suspension.
    
    (g)  In the original written statement and charges and in any hearing conducted under this chapter, the department head may not complain of an act that did not occur within the six-month period preceding the date on which the department head suspends the fire fighter or police officer.

    (b)  In a hearing conducted under this section, the department head is restricted to the department head's original written statement and charges, which may not be amended.
    
    (c)  In its decision, the commission shall state whether the suspended fire fighter or police officer is:
    
    (1)  permanently dismissed from the fire or police department;
    
    (2)  temporarily suspended from the department;  or
    
    (3)  restored to the person's former position or status in the department's classified service.
    
    (c-1)  A temporary suspension of a firefighter under Subsection (c)(2) may not exceed 90 calendar days.
    
    (d)  If the suspended fire fighter or police officer is restored to the position or class of service from which the person was suspended, the department head shall immediately reinstate the person as ordered, and the person is entitled to full compensation at the rate of pay provided for the position or class of service from which the person was suspended for the actual time lost as a result of the suspension, as provided by Section [143.1215](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=143.1215).

    (f)  If the department head intentionally refuses, for at least 10 days, to obey an order to reinstate a fire fighter or police officer, the municipality's chief executive or governing body shall discharge the department head from employment with the municipality.

Documents that must be expunged under this subsection include all documents that indicate disciplinary action was recommended or taken against the fire fighter or police officer, such as the recommendations of a disciplinary committee or a letter of suspension.  This subsection does not apply if the fire fighter or police officer is charged with using excessive force that results in a death or injury and the charge is being investigated by a law enforcement or criminal justice agency other than the department.  This subsection does not require that records of an internal affairs division or other similar internal investigative division be expunged.

    (1)  "Complainant" means a person claiming to be the victim of misconduct by a fire fighter or police officer.
    
    (2)  "Investigation" means an administrative investigation, conducted by the municipality, of alleged misconduct by a fire fighter or police officer that could result in punitive action against that person.

    (d)  An investigator may not interrogate a fire fighter or police officer who is the subject of an investigation or conduct any part of the investigation at that person's home without that person's permission.
    
    (e)  A person may not be assigned to conduct an investigation if the person is the complainant, the ultimate decisionmaker regarding disciplinary action, or a person who has any personal involvement regarding the alleged misconduct.  A fire fighter or police officer who is the subject of an investigation has the right to inquire and, on inquiry, to be informed of the identities of each investigator participating in an interrogation of the fire fighter or police officer.  Not later than the 30th day after the date that a complaint is received by an investigator, the investigator must inform the fire fighter in writing of the nature of the investigation and the name of each person who complained about the fire fighter, if known, concerning the matters under investigation unless:
    
    (1)  a criminal investigation has been initiated as a result of the complaint; or
    
    (2)  the disclosure of information concerning the name of the complainant or the matters under investigation would hinder a criminal investigation.

An investigator may not conduct an interrogation of a fire fighter or police officer based on a complaint by a complainant who is not a peace officer unless the complainant verifies the complaint in writing before a public officer who is authorized by law to take statements under oath.  In an investigation authorized under this subsection, an investigator may interrogate a fire fighter or police officer about events or conduct reported by a witness who is not a complainant without disclosing the name of the witness.  Not later than the 48th hour before the hour on which an investigator begins to interrogate a fire fighter or police officer regarding an allegation based on a complaint, affidavit, or statement, the investigator shall give the fire fighter or police officer a copy of the affidavit, complaint, or statement. An interrogation may be based on a complaint from an anonymous complainant if the departmental employee receiving the anonymous complaint certifies in writing, under oath, that the complaint was anonymous.  This subsection does not apply to an on-the-scene investigation that occurs immediately after an incident being investigated if the limitations of this subsection would unreasonably hinder the essential purpose of the investigation or interrogation.  If the limitation would hinder the investigation or interrogation, the fire fighter or police officer under investigation must be furnished, as soon as practicable, a written statement of the nature of the investigation, the name of each complaining party, and the complaint, affidavit, or statement.
    
    (g)  An interrogation session of a fire fighter or police officer who is the subject of an investigation may not be unreasonably long.  In determining reasonableness, the gravity and complexity of the investigation must be considered.  The investigators shall allow reasonable interruptions to permit the fire fighter or police officer to attend to personal physical necessities.
    
    (h)  An investigator may not threaten a fire fighter or police officer who is the subject of an investigation with punitive action during an interrogation.  However, an investigator may inform a fire fighter or police officer that failure to truthfully answer reasonable questions directly related to the investigation or to fully cooperate in the conduct of the investigation may result in punitive action.
    
    (i)  If prior notification of intent to record an interrogation is given to the other party, either the investigator or the fire fighter or police officer who is the subject of an interrogation may record the interrogation.
    
    (j)  If an investigation does not result in punitive action against a fire fighter or police officer but does result in a reprimand recorded in writing or an adverse finding or determination regarding that person, the reprimand, finding, or determination may not be placed in that person's personnel file unless the fire fighter or police officer is first given an opportunity to read and sign the document.  If the fire fighter or police officer refuses to sign the reprimand, finding, or determination, it may be placed in the personnel file with a notation that the person refused to sign it.  A fire fighter or police officer may respond in writing to a reprimand, finding, or determination that is placed in the person's personnel file under this subsection by submitting a written response to the department head within 10 days after the date the fire fighter or police officer is asked to sign the document.  The response shall be placed in the personnel file.  A fire fighter or police officer who receives a punitive action and who elects not to appeal the action may file a written response as prescribed by this subsection within 10 days after the date the person is given written notice of the punitive action from the department head.
    
    (k)  If the department head or any investigator violates any of the provisions of this section while conducting an investigation, the municipality shall reverse any punitive action taken pursuant to the investigation including a reprimand, and any information obtained during the investigation shall be specifically excluded from introduction into evidence in any proceeding against the fire fighter or police officer.

    (b)  To be eligible for legislative leave, a fire fighter or police officer must submit a written application to the municipality on or before the 30th day before the date the fire fighter or police officer intends to begin the legislative leave. The application must indicate the length of the requested leave and state that the fire fighter or police officer is willing to reimburse the municipality for any wages, pension, or other costs the municipality will incur as a result of the leave.  The length of the requested leave may not exceed the length of the session.
    
    (c)  Within 30 days after the date the municipality receives the application, the municipality shall notify the fire fighter or police officer in writing of the actual amount of money required to offset the costs the municipality will incur.

    (d)  The municipality shall grant legislative leave to a fire fighter or police officer who submits an application as prescribed by this section and who complies with any requirement relating to payment of costs unless an emergency exists or unless granting the leave will result in an insufficient number of employees to carry out the normal functions of the fire or police department.
    
    (e)  If the head of the fire or police department determines that granting a legislative leave will result in an insufficient number of employees to carry out the normal functions of the department, another fire fighter or police officer may volunteer to work in the applicant's place on an exchange of time basis as long as no overtime results.  If a fire fighter or police officer volunteers to work in the applicant's place and no overtime will result, the department head shall allow the volunteer to work for the applicant.  If the volunteer work will solve the problem of having an insufficient number of employees, the municipality shall grant the legislative leave.

    Sec. 143.1261.  LEGISLATIVE LEAVE ACCOUNT.  (a)  A fire fighter or police officer may donate not more than one hour for each month of accumulated vacation or compensatory time to an employee organization.  The municipality shall establish and maintain a legislative leave time account for each employee organization.
    
    (b)  The fire fighter or police officer must authorize the donation in writing on a form provided by the employee organization and approved by the municipality.  After receiving the signed authorization on an approved form, the municipality shall transfer donated time to the account monthly until the municipality receives the fire fighter's or police officer's written revocation of the authorization.
    
    (c)  Only a fire fighter or police officer who is a member of an employee organization may use for legislative leave purposes the time donated to that employee organization.

    (2)  credit and debit an account on an hour-for-hour basis regardless of the cash value of the time donated or used.
    
    (f)  An employee organization may not use for legislative leave purposes more than 4,000 hours from its time account under this section in a calendar year.  If more than one employee organization requests to use legislative leave, each employee organization may use a proportional share of the 4,000 hours based on the total amount of hours donated to the employee organization for its exclusive use before January 2 of the calendar year in which the legislative leave is requested.  This section does not prevent an employee organization from accumulating more than 4,000 hours.  This subsection only limits the total number of donated hours that one or more employee organizations may use in any calendar year.

    Sec. 143.201.  POPULATION.  This subchapter applies only to a municipality with a population of 1.5 million or more, but does not apply to a municipality that has adopted The Fire and Police Employee Relations Act (Article 5154c-1, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes).

    Sec. 143.202.  DEFINITIONS.  In this subchapter:
    
    (1)  "Fire fighters association" means an organization in which fire fighters participate and which exists for the purpose, in whole or in part, of dealing with one or more employers, whether public or private, concerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, hours of employment, or conditions of work affecting public employees.
    
    (2)  "Public employer" means any municipality or agency, board, commission, or political subdivision controlled by a municipality which is required to establish the wages, salaries, rates of pay, hours, working conditions, and other terms and conditions of employment of public employees.  The term may include, under appropriate circumstances, a mayor, manager, administrator of a municipality, municipal governing body, director of personnel, personnel board, or one or more other officials, regardless of the name by which they are designated.

    Sec. 143.203.  GENERAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO AGREEMENTS, RECOGNITION, AND STRIKES.  (a)  A municipality may not be denied local control over the wages, salaries, rates of pay, hours of work, and other terms and conditions of employment, or other state-mandated personnel issues, if the public employer and the fire fighters association recognized as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for all officers covered by this subchapter come to a mutual agreement on any of the terms listed above.  If no agreement is reached, the existing state laws, local ordinances, and civil service rules remain unaffected.  All agreements shall be reduced to writing.  Nothing in this subchapter shall require either party to meet and confer on any issue or reach an agreement.
    
    (b)  A public employer may only meet and confer if the fire fighters association recognized under this subchapter as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent does not advocate the illegal right to strike by public employees.
    
    (c)  Fire fighters of a municipality may not engage in strikes or organized work stoppages against this state or a political subdivision of this state.  A fire fighter who participates in a strike forfeits all civil service rights, reemployment rights, and any other rights, benefits, or privileges the fire fighter enjoys as a result of employment or prior employment, except that the right of an individual to cease work may not be abridged if the individual is not acting in concert with others in an organized work stoppage.

    (b)  In the event of a question about whether a fire fighters association represents a majority of the covered fire fighters, the question shall be resolved by a fair election conducted according to procedures agreeable to the parties.  If the parties are unable to agree on such procedures, either party may request the American Arbitration Association to conduct the election and to certify the results.  Certification of the results of an election resolves the question concerning representation.  The fire fighters association is liable for the expenses of the election, except that if two or more associations seeking recognition as the bargaining agent submit petitions signed by a majority of the covered fire fighters, the associations shall share equally the costs of the election.

    (1)  the municipality's governing body ratified the agreement by a majority vote;  and
    
    (2)  the fire fighters association ratified the agreement by a majority of the votes received in a referendum of its members by secret ballot.
    
    (b)  The state district court of the judicial district in which the municipality is located has full authority and jurisdiction on the application of either party aggrieved by an action or omission of the other party when the action or omission is related to a right, duty, or obligation provided by any written agreement ratified by both the public employer and the fire fighters association.  The court may issue proper restraining orders, temporary and permanent injunctions, and any other writ, order, or process, including contempt orders, that are appropriate to enforcing any written agreement ratified by both the public employer and the fire fighters association.

    (b)  A written agreement under this subchapter preempts all contrary local ordinances, executive orders, legislation, or rules adopted by the state or a political subdivision or agent of the state, such as a personnel board, a civil service commission, or a home-rule municipality.
    
    (c)  An agreement under this subchapter may not diminish or qualify any right, benefit, or privilege of an employee under this chapter or other law unless approved by a majority of the votes received in a secret ballot referendum of the members of the fire fighters association recognized as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent.

The lump-sum payment is computed by compensating the police officer for the accumulated time at the highest permanent pay classification for which the person was eligible during the last six months of employment.  The police officer is paid for the same period for which the person had taken the sick leave but does not include additional holidays and any sick leave or vacation time that the person might have accrued during the 720 hours.

    Sec. 143.303.  GENERAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO AGREEMENTS, RECOGNITION, AND STRIKES.  (a)  A municipality may not be denied local control over wages, salaries, rates of pay, hours of work, other terms and conditions of employment, or other personnel issues on which the public employer and an association that is recognized as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for all fire fighters or police officers in the municipality agree.  A term or condition on which the public employer and the association do not agree is governed by the applicable statutes, local ordinances, and civil service rules.  An agreement must be reduced to writing.  This subchapter does not require the public employer and the association to meet and confer or reach an agreement on any issue.
    
    (b)  A public employer and an association recognized under this subchapter as a sole and exclusive bargaining agent may meet and confer only if the association does not advocate the illegal right to strike by public employees.
    
    (c)  A fire fighter or police officer of a municipality may not engage in a strike or organized work stoppage against this state or a political subdivision of this state.  A fire fighter or police officer who participates in a strike forfeits all civil service rights, reemployment rights, and other rights, benefits, or privileges the fire fighter or police officer enjoys as a result of the person's employment or previous employment with the municipality.  This subsection does not affect the right of a person to cease employment if the person is not acting in concert with other fire fighters or police officers.

    Sec. 143.304.  RECOGNITION OF FIRE FIGHTERS OR POLICE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION.  (a)  The public employer may recognize an association that submits a petition signed by a majority of the paid fire fighters or police officers in the municipality, excluding the head of the department and assistant department heads in the rank or classification immediately below that of the department head, as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for all of the covered fire fighters or police officers unless recognition of the association is withdrawn by a majority of the covered fire fighters or police officers.
    
    (b)  A question of whether an association is the majority representative of the covered fire fighters or police officers shall be resolved by a fair election conducted according to procedures agreed on by the parties.  If the parties are unable to agree on election procedures, either party may request the American Arbitration Association to conduct the election and to certify the results.  Certification of the results of an election under this subsection resolves the question concerning representation.  The association shall pay the costs of the election, except that if two or more associations seeking recognition as the bargaining agent submit petitions signed by a majority of the covered fire fighters or police officers, the associations shall share equally the costs of the election.
    
    (c)  The public employer's manager or chief executive and the police chief or fire chief, as appropriate, shall designate a team to represent the public employer as its sole and exclusive bargaining agent for issues related to the fire department and a separate team to represent the public employer as its sole and exclusive bargaining agent for issues related to the police department.

The election shall be called for the next municipal election or a special election called by the governing body for that purpose.  If at the election a majority of the votes are cast in favor of the repeal of the adoption of the agreement, the agreement is void.

    (b)  In this section:
    
    (1)  "Complainant" means a person claiming to be the victim of misconduct by a fire fighter or police officer.
    
    (2)  "Investigation" means an administrative investigation, conducted by the municipality, of alleged misconduct by a fire fighter or police officer that could result in punitive action against that person.
    
    (3)  "Investigator" means an agent or employee of the municipality who is assigned to conduct an investigation.
    
    (4)  "Normally assigned working hours" includes those hours during which a fire fighter or police officer is actually at work or at the person's assigned place of work, but does not include any time when the person is off duty on authorized leave, including sick leave.
    
    (5)  "Punitive action" means a disciplinary suspension, indefinite suspension, demotion in rank, written reprimand, or any combination of those actions.
    
    (c)  An investigator may interrogate a fire fighter or police officer who is the subject of an investigation only during the fire fighter's or police officer's normally assigned working hours unless:
    
    (1)  the seriousness of the investigation, as determined by the fire fighter's or police officer's department head or the department head's designee, requires interrogation at another time;  and
    
    (2)  the fire fighter or police officer is compensated for the interrogation time on an overtime basis.
    
    (d)  The department head may not consider work time missed from regular duties by a fire fighter or police officer due to participation in the conduct of an investigation in determining whether to impose a punitive action or in determining the severity of a punitive action.
    
    (e)  An investigator may not interrogate a fire fighter or police officer who is the subject of an investigation or conduct any part of the investigation at that person's home without that person's permission.
    
    (f)  A person may not be assigned to conduct an investigation if the person is the complainant, the ultimate decision-maker regarding disciplinary action, or a person who has any personal involvement regarding the alleged misconduct.  A fire fighter or police officer who is the subject of an investigation has the right to inquire and, on inquiry, to be informed of the identities of each investigator participating in an interrogation of the fire fighter or police officer.
    
    (g)  Not less than 48 hours before an investigator begins the initial interrogation of a fire fighter or police officer who is the subject of an investigation, the investigator must inform the fire fighter or police officer in writing of the allegations in the complaint.  An investigator may not interrogate a fire fighter or police officer based on a complaint by a complainant who is not a fire fighter or police officer unless the complainant verifies the complaint in writing before a public officer who is authorized by law to take statements under oath.  In an investigation under this subsection, an investigator may interrogate a fire fighter or police officer about events or conduct reported by a witness who is not a complainant without disclosing the name of the witness.  An interrogation may be based on a complaint from an anonymous complainant if the departmental employee receiving the anonymous complaint certifies in writing, under oath, that the complaint was anonymous.  This subsection does not apply to an on-the-scene investigation that occurs immediately after an incident being investigated, except that the fire fighter or police officer under investigation must be furnished, as soon as practicable, a written statement of the allegations in the complaint.
    
    (h)  An interrogation session of a fire fighter or police officer who is the subject of an investigation may not be unreasonably long.  In determining reasonableness, the gravity and complexity of the investigation must be considered.  The investigators shall allow reasonable interruptions to permit the fire fighter or police officer to attend to personal physical necessities.
    
    (i)  An investigator may not threaten a fire fighter or police officer who is the subject of an investigation with punitive action during an interrogation.  An investigator may inform a fire fighter or police officer that failure to answer truthfully reasonable questions directly related to the investigation or to cooperate fully in the conduct of the investigation may result in punitive action.
    
    (j)  If prior notification of intent to record an interrogation is given to the other party, either the investigator or the fire fighter or police officer who is the subject of an interrogation may record the interrogation.
    
    (k)  If an investigation does not result in punitive action against a fire fighter or police officer but does result in a written reprimand or an adverse finding or determination regarding that person, the reprimand, finding, or determination may not be placed in that person's personnel file unless the fire fighter or police officer is first given an opportunity to read and sign the document.  If the fire fighter or police officer refuses to sign the reprimand, finding, or determination, it may be placed in the personnel file with a notation that the person refused to sign it.  A fire fighter or police officer may respond in writing to a reprimand, finding, or determination that is placed in the person's personnel file under this subsection by submitting a written response to the department head not later than the 10th day after the date the fire fighter or police officer is asked to sign the document.  The response shall be placed in the personnel file.  A fire fighter or police officer who receives a punitive action and who elects not to appeal the action may file a written response as prescribed by this subsection not later than the 10th day after the date the person is given written notice of the punitive action from the department head.
    
    (l)  A violation of this section may be considered by the commission or hearing examiner during a disciplinary appeal hearing if the violation substantially impaired the fire fighter's or police officer's ability to defend against the allegations of misconduct.

    (b)  A fire fighter employed by the municipality may not be required to submit to a polygraph examination as part of an internal investigation regarding the conduct of the fire fighter unless:
    
    (1)  the complainant submits to and passes a polygraph examination;  or
    
    (2)  the fire fighter is ordered to take an examination under Subsection (f).
    
    (c)  Subsection (b) does not apply if the complainant is physically or mentally incapable of being polygraphed.
    
    (d)  For the purposes of this section, a fire fighter passes a polygraph examination if, in the opinion of the polygraph examiner, no deception is indicated in the examination regarding matters critical to the subject matter under investigation.
    
    (e)  The results of a polygraph examination that relate to the complaint under investigation are not admissible in a proceeding before the commission or a hearing examiner.
    
    (f)  The head of the fire department may order a fire fighter to submit to a polygraph examination if the fire department head:
    
    (1)  considers the circumstances to be extraordinary;  or
    
    (2)  believes that the integrity of a fire fighter or the fire department is in question.
