    Sec. 305.014.  PAYMENTS BY MUNICIPALITY.  (a)  The purchase price may be paid by the municipality in cash and the funds for the payment may be obtained by the municipality in any manner permitted by law.  In the alternative, the purchase price may be paid by the municipality in installments with interest at not lower than the same rates borne by the county's outstanding coliseum or stadium bonds.  The funds with which to make the installments may be obtained by the municipality in any lawful manner, including one or more of the methods described by Subsections (b) and (c).
    
    (b)  The installments, by the sale agreement, may be made payable to the county out of revenues of the stadium or coliseum on dates coinciding with or earlier than the dates on which principal and interest on the county's outstanding coliseum or stadium bonds mature and come due.  If this method of payment is selected, the payments due the county may be treated as a fixed operating expense of the stadium or coliseum payable solely from the revenues of the facilities.  When received by the county, the funds shall be used for the purpose of retiring and paying interest on its outstanding coliseum or stadium bonds when due.
    
    (c)  The municipality and county may agree that the municipality shall issue a series of coliseum or stadium acquisition revenue bonds (or include such purpose as a part of a larger series of coliseum or stadium revenue bonds), which revenue bonds (or part of a larger series allocable to the purchase) shall be delivered to the county in payment of the purchase price for the stadium or coliseum.  The bonds must be at least payable at the times and in the same amounts as and bear not lower than the same rates of interest borne by the county's outstanding coliseum or stadium bonds so as to provide funds from the revenue bonds to the county with which to pay the principal and interest when due on its outstanding bonds.  The revenue bonds of the municipality may be on other terms as the municipality and county agree and may include any mortgage security authorized by Subchapter A, Chapter [1504](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=1504), Government Code. On delivery of the bonds to the county, the county shall hold the bonds for the account of the interest and sinking fund created in connection with its outstanding coliseum or stadium bonds and shall use the payments when received to pay the principal and interest on its bonds when due.

    Sec. 305.017.  SALE BY MUNICIPALITY.

    (b)  The sale shall be on the terms as the governing body may approve.  The municipality has all power necessary and appropriate to complete the sale in accordance with the terms of the sale.
