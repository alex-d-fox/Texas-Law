    Sec. 232.001.  PLAT REQUIRED.  (a)  The owner of a tract of land located outside the limits of a municipality must have a plat of the subdivision prepared if the owner divides the tract into two or more parts to lay out:
    
    (1)  a subdivision of the tract, including an addition;
    
    (2)  lots; or
    
    (3)  streets, alleys, squares, parks, or other parts of the tract intended by the owner of the tract to be dedicated to public use.
    
    (a-1)  A division of a tract under Subsection (a) includes a division regardless of whether it is made by using a metes and bounds description in a deed of conveyance or in a contract for a deed, by using a contract of sale or other executory contract to convey, or by using any other method.
    
    (b)  To be recorded, the plat must:
    
    (1)  describe the subdivision by metes and bounds;
    
    (2)  locate the subdivision with respect to an original corner of the original survey of which it is a part;  and
    
    (3)  state the dimensions of the subdivision and of each lot, street, alley, square, park, or other part of the tract intended to be dedicated to public use or for the use of purchasers or owners of lots fronting on or adjacent to the street, alley, square, park, or other part.
    
    (c)  The owner or proprietor of the tract or the owner's or proprietor's agent must acknowledge the plat in the manner required for the acknowledgment of deeds.
    
    (d)  The plat must be filed and recorded with the county clerk of the county in which the tract is located.
    
    (e)  The plat is subject to the filing and recording provisions of Section [12.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=12.002), Property Code.
    
    (f)  The commissioners court may require a plat application submitted for approval to include a digital map that is compatible with other mapping systems used by the county and that georeferences the subdivision plat and related public infrastructure using the Texas Coordinate Systems adopted under Section [21.071](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=21.071), Natural Resources Code.  A digital map required under this subsection may be required only in a format widely used by common geographic information system software.  A requirement adopted under this subsection must provide for an exemption from the requirement if the owner of the tract submits with the plat application an acknowledged statement indicating that the digital mapping technology necessary to submit a map that complies with this subsection was not reasonably accessible.
    
    (g)  A plat is considered filed on the date the applicant submits the plat, along with a completed plat application and the application fees and other requirements prescribed by or under this subchapter, to:
    
    (1)  the commissioners court; or
    
    (2)  the county authority responsible for approving plats.
    
    (h)  The commissioners court or the county authority responsible for approving plats may not require an analysis, study, document, agreement, or similar requirement to be included in or as part of an application for a plat, development permit, or subdivision of land that is not explicitly required by state law.

    (b)  A person owning real property in this state that has been subdivided into lots and blocks or into small subdivisions may apply to the commissioners court of the county in which the property is located for permission to cancel all or part of the subdivision, including a dedicated easement or roadway, to reestablish the property as acreage tracts as it existed before the subdivision.  If, on the application, it is shown that the cancellation of all or part of the subdivision does not interfere with the established rights of any purchaser who owns any part of the subdivision, or it is shown that the purchaser agrees to the cancellation, the commissioners court by order shall authorize the owner of the subdivision to file an instrument canceling the subdivision in whole or in part.  The instrument must describe the subdivision or the part of it that is canceled.  The court shall enter the order in its minutes.  After the cancellation instrument is filed and recorded in the deed records of the county, the county tax assessor-collector shall assess the property as if it had never been subdivided.
    
    (c)  The commissioners court shall publish notice of an application for cancellation.  The notice must be published in a newspaper, published in the English language, in the county for at least three weeks before the date on which action is taken on the application.  The court shall take action on an application at a regular term.  The published notice must direct any person who is interested in the property and who wishes to protest the proposed cancellation to appear at the time specified in the notice.
    
    (d)  If delinquent taxes are owed on the subdivided tract for any preceding year, and if the application to cancel the subdivision is granted as provided by this section, the owner of the tract may pay the delinquent taxes on an acreage basis as if the tract had not been subdivided.  For the purpose of assessing the tract for a preceding year, the county tax assessor-collector shall back assess the tract on an acreage basis.
    
    (e)  On application for cancellation of a subdivision or any phase or identifiable part of a subdivision, including a dedicated easement or roadway, by the owners of 75 percent of the property included in the subdivision, phase, or identifiable part, the commissioners court by order shall authorize the cancellation in the manner and after notice and a hearing as provided by Subsections (b) and (c).  However, if the owners of at least 10 percent of the property affected by the proposed cancellation file written objections to the cancellation with the court, the grant of an order of cancellation is at the discretion of the court.
    
    (f)  To maintain an action to enjoin the cancellation or closing of a roadway or easement in a subdivision, a person must own a lot or part of the subdivision that:
    
    (1)  abuts directly on the part of the roadway or easement to be canceled or closed;  or
    
    (2)  is connected by the part of the roadway or easement to be canceled or closed, by the most direct feasible route, to:
    
    (A)  the nearest remaining public highway, county road, or access road to the public highway or county road;  or
    
    (B)  any uncanceled common amenity of the subdivision.
    
    (g)  A person who appears before the commissioners court to protest the cancellation of all or part of a subdivision may maintain an action for damages against the person applying for the cancellation and may recover as damages an amount not to exceed the amount of the person's original purchase price for property in the canceled subdivision or part of the subdivision.  The person must bring the action within one year after the date of the entry of the commissioners court's order granting the cancellation.
    
    (h)  Regardless of the date land is subdivided or a plat is filed for a subdivision, the commissioners court may deny a cancellation under this section if the commissioners court determines the cancellation will prevent the proposed interconnection of infrastructure to pending or existing development as defined by Section [232.0085](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=232.0085).

If all or part of the subdivided tract has been sold to nondeveloper owners, the court shall also give notice to each of those owners by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, at the owner's address in the subdivided tract.
    
    (b-1)  If the commissioners court determines that the revision to the subdivision plat does not affect a public interest or public property of any type, including, but not limited to, a park, school, or road, the notice requirements under Subsection (b) do not apply to the application and the commissioners court shall:
    
    (1)  provide written notice of the application to the owners of the lots that are within 200 feet of the subdivision plat to be revised, as indicated in the most recent records of the central appraisal district of the county in which the lots are located; and

    (1)  the revision will not interfere with the established rights of any owner of a part of the subdivided land;  or
    
    (2)  each owner whose rights may be interfered with has agreed to the revision.
    
    (d)  If the commissioners court permits a person to revise a subdivision plat, the person may make the revision by filing for record with the county clerk a revised plat or part of a plat that indicates the changes made to the original plat.
    
    (e)  The commissioners court may impose a fee for filing an application under this section.  The amount of the fee must be based on the cost of processing the application, including publishing the notices required under Subsection (b) or (b-1).

    (b)  If the commissioners court makes a written finding that the subdivider who created the unplatted subdivision no longer owns property in the subdivision, the commissioners court may grant a delay or variance under this section only if:
    
    (1)  a majority of the lots in the subdivision were sold before:
    
    (A)  September 1, 1995, in a county defined under Section [232.022](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=232.022)(a)(1); or

    (2)  a majority of the resident purchasers in the subdivision sign a petition supporting the delay or variance;
    
    (3)  the person requesting the delay or variance submits to the commissioners court:
    
    (A)  a description of the water and sewer service facilities that will be constructed or installed to service the subdivision;

    (5)  the subdivider who created the unplatted subdivision has not violated local law, federal law, or state law, excluding this chapter, in subdividing the land for which the delay or variance is requested, if the subdivider is the person requesting the delay or variance.
    
    (c)  If the commissioners court makes a written finding that the subdivider who created the unplatted subdivision owns property in the subdivision, the commissioners court may grant a provisional delay or variance only if the requirements of Subsection (b) are satisfied.  The commissioners court may issue a final grant of the delay or variance only if the commissioners court has not received objections from the attorney general before the 91st day after the date the commissioners court submits the record of its proceedings to the attorney general as prescribed by Subsection (d).
    
    (d)  If the commissioners court grants a delay or variance under this section, the commissioners court shall:
    
    (1)  make findings specifying the reason compliance with each requirement is impractical or contrary to the health or safety of residents of the subdivision;
    
    (2)  keep a record of its proceedings and include in the record documentation of the findings and the information submitted under Subsection (b);  and
    
    (3)  submit a copy of the record to the attorney general.
    
    (e)  The failure of the attorney general to comment or object to a delay or variance granted under this section does not constitute a waiver of or consent to the validity of the delay or variance granted.
    
    (f)  This section does not affect a civil suit filed against, a criminal prosecution of, or the validity of a penalty imposed on a subdivider for a violation of law, regardless of the date on which the violation occurred.

A digital map required under this subsection may be required only in a format widely used by common geographic information system software.  A requirement adopted under this subsection must provide for an exemption from the requirement if the owner of the tract submits with the plat application an acknowledged statement indicating that the digital mapping technology necessary to submit a map that complies with this subsection was not reasonably accessible.

(a) In addition to the authority granted under Section [232.045](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=232.045), a commissioners court may implement an expedited process to administratively determine that a platted lot is abandoned, unoccupied, and undeveloped if the lot:

    (2)  is part of a subdivision in which 50 percent or more of the lots are undeveloped or unoccupied;
    
    (3)  is part of a subdivision in which 50 percent or more of the lots are 10 acres or less in size; 
    
    (4)  had an assessed value of less than $1,000 as of January 1, 2021; and
    
    (5)  as of January 1, 2021, was not valued for ad valorem taxation as land for agricultural use pursuant to Subchapter [C](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=23.41), Chapter [23](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=23), Tax Code.

    Sec. 232.153.  PUBLIC HEARING.  (a) Before a county may make an administrative determination that a platted lot is abandoned, unoccupied, and undeveloped, the county must:
    
    (1)  hold a public hearing on the matter; and
    
    (2)  make reasonable efforts to notify each owner and lienholder of the lot of the time and place of the hearing as provided by Section [232.154](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=232.154).

It is an affirmative defense to a determination under Section [232.152](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=232.152) that a lot's ad valorem taxes have been paid in full for each year that the taxing authority issued a tax invoice.
    
    (d)  The county may conduct a single hearing for multiple lots and make a determination that multiple lots are abandoned, unoccupied, and undeveloped based on the same evidence.
    
    (e)  Not later than the 14th day after the date of the hearing, if a lot is determined to be abandoned, unoccupied, and undeveloped, the county shall issue an order of its determination.
    
    (f)  Not later than the 14th day after the date of the order, the county shall:

    (A)  a description of the lot;
    
    (B)  the date of the hearing;
    
    (C)  a brief statement of the results of the order; 
    
    (D)  instructions stating where a complete copy of the order may be obtained; and 
    
    (E)  notice that the order is appealable to a district court in the county within 60 calendar days of the order.

    (A)  the commissioners court has adopted an order under this subchapter; and
    
    (B)  the information required by Subsection (f)(2) may be found on the county's Internet website.

    (2)  publish notice of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the county on or before the 10th day before the date of the hearing and on the county's Internet website; and
    
    (3)  file in the property records of the county notice of the hearing that contains:
    
    (A)  the name and last known address of the owner of the applicable lot; and
    
    (B)  a description of the administrative determination proceeding, including notice that the administrative determination may result in the extinguishment of any and all rights and legal interests in the lot.
    
    (b)  Notice under Subsection (a)(1) must be provided to each owner and lienholder for whom an address can be reasonably ascertained from the deed of trust or other applicable instrument on file in the office of the county clerk or in the records of the office of the central appraisal district for the county.

    (d)  An owner or lienholder is presumed to have received actual and constructive notice of the hearing if the commissioners court complies with this section, regardless of whether the commissioners court receives a response from the person.

    Sec. 232.156.  CIVIL ACTION FOR RECEIVERSHIP.  (a) After a final determination that a platted lot is abandoned, unoccupied, and undeveloped, the county shall bring a civil action to have the lot placed in a receivership.  On a final determination that a platted lot is abandoned, unoccupied, and undeveloped as provided by this subchapter, an owner or lienholder's rights and legal interests are extinguished, subject to the provisions of this subchapter regarding any net proceeds resulting from the disposition of the property, and transferred to the receiver.

    (1)  take control of the platted lot;
    
    (2)  make or have made any repairs or improvements to the platted lot to make the lot developable;
    
    (3)  make provisions for the platted lot to be subject to street, road, drainage, utility, and other infrastructure requirements;

    (c)  The appointed receiver is an officer of the court.
    
    (d)  If a receiver dies, resigns, or becomes incapacitated, the court shall appoint a receiver to succeed the former receiver.
    
    (e)  If the donation of a lot to the receiver is not challenged before the first anniversary of the donation date, the donation is final and not revocable under any other legal proceeding.
    
    (f)  All funds that come into the hands of the receiver shall be deposited in a place in this state directed by the court. The receiver's use of the funds in connection with the receiver's duties or authority under this subchapter shall be subject to the approval of the court.  All net proceeds from the disposition of a lot by the receiver shall be placed in trust and remain in trust for at least three years, unless claimed before the expiration of the trust period.  The court must order additional notices to an owner or lienholder about the net proceeds as are practicable during the trust period and, on expiration of the trust period, any money remaining in the receivership shall escheat to the state.  Funds escheated to the state under this subchapter are subject to disposition or recovery under Subchapters [C](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=71.201) and D, Chapter [71](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=71), Property Code.

    (h)  The court must approve any sale of the property by the receiver.
    
    (i)  A receiver shall have a lien on the property under receivership for all of the receiver's unreimbursed costs and expenses and any receivership fee as detailed in the summary and accounting under Subsection (g)(1).
