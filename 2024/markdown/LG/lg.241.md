    Sec. 241.002.  LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.  The legislature finds that:
    
    (1)  an airport hazard endangers the lives and property of users of the airport and of occupants of land in the vicinity of the airport;
    
    (2)  an airport hazard that is an obstruction reduces the size of the area available for the landing, taking off, and maneuvering of aircraft, tending to destroy or impair the utility of the airport and the public investment in the airport;
    
    (3)  the creation of an airport hazard is a public nuisance and an injury to the community served by the airport affected by the hazard;
    
    (4)  it is necessary in the interest of the public health, public safety, and general welfare to prevent the creation of an airport hazard;
    
    (5)  the creation of an airport hazard should be prevented, to the extent legally possible, by the exercise of the police power without compensation;  and
    
    (6)  the prevention of the creation of an airport hazard and the elimination, the removal, the alteration, the mitigation, or the marking and lighting of an airport hazard are public purposes for which a political subdivision may raise and spend public funds and acquire land or interests in land.

    Sec. 241.041.  JUDICIAL REVIEW OF BOARD DECISION.  (a)  A person who is aggrieved or a taxpayer who is affected by a decision of a board of adjustment, or the governing body of a political subdivision or a joint airport zoning board that believes a decision of a board of adjustment is illegal, may present to a court of record a verified petition stating that the decision of the board of adjustment is illegal in whole or in part and specifying the grounds of the illegality.  The petition must be presented within 10 days after the date the decision is filed in the board's office.
    
    (b)  On the presentation of the petition, the court may grant a writ of certiorari directed to the board of adjustment to review the board's decision.  Granting of the writ does not stay the proceedings on the decision under appeal, but on application and after notice to the board the court may grant a restraining order if due cause is shown.
    
    (c)  The board's return must be verified and must concisely state any pertinent and material facts that show the grounds of the decision that is appealed.  The board is not required to return the original documents on which the board acted but may return certified or sworn copies of the documents or parts of the documents as provided by the writ.

    Sec. 241.043.  EFFECT OF HOLDING OF THE COURT.  If the court holds that an airport zoning regulation, although generally reasonable, interferes with the use or enjoyment of a particular structure or parcel of land to such an extent that, or is so onerous in its application to a particular structure or parcel of land that, the application of the regulation constitutes a taking or deprivation of property in violation of the state or federal constitution, the holding does not affect the application of the regulation to any other structure or parcel of land.
