    SUBCHAPTER C. FIREWORKS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 352.051.  REGULATION OF RESTRICTED FIREWORKS.  (a)  For the purposes of this section the following definitions shall apply:
    
    (1)  "Restricted fireworks" means only those items classified under 49 C.F.R. Sec. 173.100(r)(2) (10-1-86 edition), as "skyrockets with sticks" and "missiles with fins".
    
    (2)  "Drought conditions" means the existence immediately preceding or during the fireworks season of a Keetch-Byram Drought Index of 575 or greater.
    
    (b)(1)  The Texas A&M Forest Service in the ordinary course of its activities shall determine whether drought conditions, as defined under Subsection (a)(2), exist on average in any county requesting such a determination.  The Texas A&M Forest Service shall make available the measurement index guidelines used to determine whether drought conditions exist in a particular area.  Following any determination that such drought conditions exist, the Texas A&M Forest Service shall notify said county or counties when such drought conditions no longer exist.  The Texas A&M Forest Service shall make its services available each day during the Texas Independence Day, San Jacinto Day, Memorial Day, Fourth of July, Diwali, and December fireworks seasons to respond to the request of any county for a determination whether drought conditions exist on average in the county.
    
    (2)  The Texas A&M Forest Service shall be allowed to take such donations of equipment or funds as necessary to aid in the carrying out of this section.
    
    (c)  Upon a determination under this section that drought conditions exist on average in a specified county, the commissioners court of the county by order may prohibit or restrict the sale or use of restricted fireworks in the unincorporated area of the county.  In addition, during the December fireworks season, the commissioners court of a county by order may restrict or prohibit the sale or use of restricted fireworks in specified areas when conditions on rural acreage in the county not under cultivation for a period of at least 12 months are determined to be extremely hazardous for the danger of fire because of high grass or dry vegetation.
    
    (d)  To facilitate compliance with an order adopted under Subsection (c), the order must be adopted before:
    
    (1)  February 15 of each year for the Texas Independence Day fireworks season;
    
    (2)  April 1 of each year for the San Jacinto Day fireworks season;
    
    (3)  April 25 of each year for the Cinco de Mayo fireworks season;
    
    (4)  May 15 of each year for the Memorial Day fireworks season;

    (6)  15 days before the beginning of Diwali for the Diwali fireworks season; and
    
    (7)  December 15 of each year for each December fireworks season.
    
    (e)  An order issued under this section shall expire upon determination as provided under Subsection (b) that such drought conditions no longer exist.
    
    (f)  When a county issues an order restricting or prohibiting the sale or use of restricted fireworks under this section, the county may designate one or more areas of appropriate size and accessibility in the county as safe areas where the use of restricted fireworks is not prohibited, and the legislature encourages a county to designate such an area for that purpose.  The safe area may be provided by the county, a municipality within the county, or an individual, business, or corporation.  A safe area may be designated in and provided in the geographic area of the regulatory jurisdiction of a municipality if the activity conducted in the safe area is authorized by general law or a municipal regulation or ordinance.  An area is considered safe if adequate public safety and fire protection services are provided to the area.  A county, municipality, individual, business, or corporation is not liable for injuries or damages resulting from the designation, maintenance, or use of the safe area.
    
    (g)  A person selling any type of fireworks, including restricted fireworks, in a county that has adopted an order under Subsection (c) shall, at every location at which the person sells fireworks in the county, provide reasonable notice of the order and reasonable notice of any location designated under Subsection (f) as a safe area.
    
    (h)  An affected party is entitled to injunctive relief to prevent the violation or threatened violation of a requirement or prohibition established by an order adopted under this section.
    
    (i)  A person commits an offense if the person knowingly or intentionally violates a prohibition established by an order issued under this section.  An offense under this subsection is a Class C misdemeanor.
    
    (j)  A civil action against a county based on the county's actions under this section must be brought in the appropriate court in that county.

    (2)  the commissioners court makes a finding that circumstances present in all or part of the unincorporated area create a public safety hazard that would be exacerbated by outdoor burning.
    
    (d)  An order adopted under this section must specify the period during which outdoor burning is prohibited or restricted.

    Sec. 352.115.  ADDITIONAL ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS.  (a)  In a gated community or multi-unit housing project that has one or more vehicular gates:
    
    (1)  at least one vehicular gate must be wide enough for fire-fighting vehicles, fire-fighting equipment, emergency medical services vehicles, or law enforcement vehicles to enter; and
    
    (2)  at least one driveway apron or entrance from the public right-of-way must be free of permanent obstacles that might impede entry by a vehicle or equipment listed in Subdivision (1).
    
    (b)  The county fire marshal or other authority shall waive the vehicular gate width requirements of Subsection (a) for a multi-unit housing project completed before January 1, 2002, if the requirements cannot readily be met because of space limitations or excessive cost.  For purposes of this subsection, $6,000 per entrance based on the value of the dollar on January 1, 2000, is considered an excessive cost for expanding gate width and achieving an obstacle-free driveway apron or entrance.
    
    (c)  A pedestrian gate in a gated community or multi-unit housing project must be located so as to provide firefighters, law enforcement officers, and other emergency personnel reasonable access to each building.
