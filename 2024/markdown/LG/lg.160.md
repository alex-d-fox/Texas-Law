    CHAPTER 160. GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE FOR COUNTY EMPLOYEES
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 160.001.  POLICY.  The purpose of this chapter is to provide reasonable, standardized grievance procedures for certain counties and their employees because:
    
    (1)  it is the policy of this state that the right of public employees to present, individually or through a representative that does not claim the right to strike, grievances concerning their wages, hours of work, or conditions of work should continue unimpaired; and
    
    (2)  the application of that policy creates a need for reasonable, standardized procedures for certain populous counties and their employees.
