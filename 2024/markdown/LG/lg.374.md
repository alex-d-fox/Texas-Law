    Sec. 374.001.  SHORT TITLE.  This chapter may be cited as the Texas Urban Renewal Law.
    
    
    
    
    Acts 1987, 70th Leg., ch. 149, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1987.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 374.002.  LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS;  INTENT.  (a)  The legislature finds that slum and blighted areas exist in municipalities in this state and that those areas:
    
    (1)  are a serious and growing menace that is injurious and inimical to the public health, safety, morals, and welfare of the residents of this state;
    
    (2)  contribute substantially and increasingly to the spread of disease and crime, requiring excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for the preservation of the public health and safety, and for crime prevention, correctional facilities, prosecution and punishment, treatment of juvenile delinquency, and the maintenance of adequate police, fire, and accident protection and other public services and facilities;  and
    
    (3)  constitute an economic and social liability, substantially impair the sound growth of affected municipalities, and retard the provision of housing accommodations.
    
    (b)  For these reasons, prevention and elimination of slum and blighted areas are matters of state policy and concern that may be best addressed by the combined action of private enterprise, municipal regulation, and other public action through approved urban renewal plans.  The legislature further finds that the repair and rehabilitation of buildings and other improvements in affected areas, public acquisition of real property, demolition of buildings and other improvements as necessary to eliminate slum or blight conditions or to prevent the spread of those conditions, the disposition of property acquired in affected areas and incidental to the purposes stated by this subsection, and other public assistance to eliminate those conditions are public purposes for which public money may be spent and the power of eminent domain exercised.
    
    (c)  It is the intent of the legislature that private enterprise be encouraged to participate in accomplishing the objectives of urban renewal to the extent of its capacity and with governmental assistance as provided by this chapter.

    Sec. 374.014.  MUNICIPAL URBAN RENEWAL PLAN.  (a)  A municipality may not prepare an urban renewal plan for an area unless the governing body of the municipality has, by resolution, declared the area to be a slum area, a blighted area, or both, and has designated the area as appropriate for an urban renewal project.

The urban renewal agency and the planning commission shall submit written recommendations relating to the proposed urban renewal plan to the governing body within 30 days after the date the plan is received for review.  On receipt of those recommendations, the governing body shall hold a hearing relating to the proposed plan as provided by Subsection (c).  If recommendations are not proposed within the 30-day period, the governing body may hold the hearing without recommendations.
    
    (c)  The governing body must hold a public hearing on the proposed urban renewal plan before it may approve the urban renewal plan.

    (e)  An urban renewal plan may be modified at any time.  If modified after the lease or sale by the municipality of real property within the urban renewal project area, the modification is subject to the rights at law or in equity of the lessee or purchaser, or that person's successor in interest.  If a proposed modification affects the street layout, land use, public utilities, zoning, if any, open space, or density of the area, the modification may not be made until it is submitted to the planning commission and a report is made to the governing body as provided by Subsection (b).

A property owner may contest before the governing body any exercise of eminent domain authority that affects that person's individual ownership and may appeal to the district court.  The review on appeal is by trial de novo.

    (c)  The purchaser or lessee of property transferred under this section, and a successor in interest to such a person, including an assignee, must devote the property to the uses specified in the urban renewal plan and may be obligated to comply with conditions specified in the deed of conveyance, including the requirement to begin any improvements required by the urban renewal plan within a reasonable time.
    
    (d)  Real property or an interest in real property subject to this section may only be sold, leased, or otherwise transferred or retained at not less than the fair value of the property for uses in accordance with the urban renewal plan.  In determining the fair value, the municipality shall consider:
    
    (1)  the uses provided in the urban renewal plan;
    
    (2)  any restrictions on and any covenants, conditions, and obligations assumed by the purchaser, lessee, or municipality in retaining the property;
    
    (3)  the objectives of the plan for the prevention of the recurrence of slums or blighted areas;  and
    
    (4)  any other matters that the municipality specifies as appropriate.
    
    (e)  The municipality or urban renewal agency may provide in an instrument of conveyance to a private purchaser or lessee that the purchaser or lessee may sell any or all of the unimproved property without profit to the seller.  After improving a parcel of real property in accordance with the development plan adopted for the area, the purchaser may sell the parcel before completion of the development of the area or tract purchased, but the sale does not relieve that purchaser from the obligation of completing the development of that area or tract.  The purchaser may sell a parcel of land purchased for redevelopment to another person who is obligated to improve the parcel as provided by the development plan for that project if the resale is without profit to the seller and if any subsequent purchaser is required to improve the property as provided by the urban renewal plan and by the conditions contained in the deed of conveyance.
    
    (f)  A municipality shall sell real property acquired by the municipality that is to be sold to private developers in accordance with the urban renewal plan as rapidly as is feasible in the public interest and consistent with the goals of the urban renewal plan.  An instrument executed by a municipality or by an urban renewal agency that purports to convey any right, title, or interest in any property under this chapter is presumed to be executed in compliance with this chapter with respect to the title or interest of any bona fide lessee, transferee, or purchaser of the property.
    
    (g)  A municipality that sells real property in an urban renewal area to a private person must conduct the sale through competitive sealed bids after advertising the offer in the official publication or a newspaper of general circulation.  The advertisement must be published once before the 15th day before the date of the sale and must invite bids for the purchase of real property in the urban renewal area either in whole or in parcels as determined by the municipality.  Before advertising for bids, the municipality shall adopt as part of the specifications in the general plan of improvement any conditions binding on the purchaser or the purchaser's successors in title, including heirs and assignees.  The municipality or urban renewal agency may accept the highest and best responsible bid.  The purchase price must be paid in cash.  If the municipality or agency determines that the bids received are not satisfactory, it may reject all the bids and readvertise the offer.  The urban renewal agency may not sell the property until the price and conditions of sale are approved by the governing body of the municipality.  The municipality shall sell any real property acquired in connection with an urban renewal and rehabilitation project within a reasonable time for the purposes applicable to each project, except for the property retained by the municipality for public use.  Property to be resold shall be sold within a reasonable time, taking into account the general economic situation at the time of sale.
    
    (h)  The municipality may temporarily lease any real property acquired in an urban renewal area, except property that is not fit for human habitation or that is declared substandard by any governmental agency.  The lease must provide for a right of cancellation that permits the municipality to sell or dispose of the property for the purposes of this chapter.
    
    (i)  The former owner of any real property that is acquired under this chapter and that is not dedicated within a reasonable time to the purposes applicable to the urban renewal project for which it was acquired is entitled, after notice, to repurchase the property at the price for which it was acquired, less any actual damages sustained by the former owner because of the taking of the property, unless the property is devoted to the urban renewal purposes within 60 days after the date the former owner gives the record owner and the municipality written notice of the intention to exercise the right of repurchase.  After a repurchase, any buildings placed on or allowed to remain on the property must conform to the pattern and intent of the urban renewal project if the project is completed.
    
    (j)  Any purchaser or lessee who is a private developer of any part of the real property acquired under this chapter may use that property as security to finance the development of the property.  The purchaser or lessee may execute and deliver to a lender notes, deeds of trust with powers of sale, mortgages, and other instruments required in connection with obtaining and securing the repayment of the loan.  The purchaser or lessee has all the rights, titles, and incidents of ownership available to a purchaser or lessee of land generally, and the person is entitled to mortgage and encumber the property for either the purchase price or for improvements in accordance with the objectives of this chapter.  Any subsequent owner or lessee who acquires title through foreclosure of a lien given to secure the indebtedness or through a conveyance or assignment in satisfaction of debt takes title subject only to the restrictive covenants related to the use and improvement of the land that are contained in the original conveyance from the municipality.  The owner's or lessee's interest is not subject to any condition precedent or condition subsequent that would result in reverter or forfeiture of title or to any restraint as to the amount for which the property may be resold or leased.
    
    (k)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or of any other law relating to competitive bid requirements, a municipality or urban renewal agency may sell urban renewal land for uses in accordance with an urban renewal plan to a public or private nonprofit corporation or foundation.  The sale must be for at least the fair market value of the land as determined by the municipality or urban renewal agency.

The commissioners shall designate one member to serve as chairman and one to serve as vice-chairman for one-year terms.  A member of the board must be a resident of the municipality and a real property owner.

    Sec. 374.026.  URBAN RENEWAL BONDS.  (a)  An urban renewal agency created under this subchapter may issue bonds from time to time to finance an urban renewal project, including the payment of principal and interest on any advances for surveys and plans.  The agency may also issue refunding bonds for the payment or retirement of bonds previously issued.
    
    (b)  Bonds issued under this section must be made payable, both as to principal and interest, only from the income, proceeds, revenues, and funds of the urban renewal agency that are derived from or held in connection with the conduct of urban renewal projects.  Payment of the principal and interest of the bonds may be further secured by a pledge of any loan, grant, or contribution from the federal government, or from any other source, in aid of an urban renewal project, or by a mortgage of such a project if title is held by the urban renewal agency.
    
    (c)  A bond issued under this section is not an indebtedness of the state or of a political subdivision of the state other than the issuing urban renewal agency and is not subject to any other law relating to the authorization, issuance, or sale of bonds.
    
    (d)  A bond issued under this section is issued for an essential public and governmental purpose and is, with the interest on the bond and the income from it, exempt from taxes.
    
    (e)  A bond issued under this section must be authorized by a resolution or ordinance of the governing body of the urban renewal agency and may be issued in one or more series.  The bond must bear the date, be payable on demand or mature at a time or times, bear interest at a rate, be in a denomination or denominations, be in either coupon or registered form, carry conversion or registration privileges, have a rank or priority, have a manner of execution, be payable in a medium of payment and at a place or places of payment, be subject to terms of redemption, with or without premium, be secured in a manner, and have any other characteristics, as provided by the resolution, trust indenture, or mortgage issued in relation to the bond.
    
    (f)  A bond issued under this section may be sold at not less than par at a public sale held after notice is published in a newspaper of general circulation in the area of operation and in any other medium of publication determined by the urban renewal agency and may also be exchanged for other bonds on a par basis.  A bond issued under this section is fully negotiable.
    
    (g)  A bond issued under this section may be sold to the federal government at not less than par at a private sale.  If less than all of the authorized principal amount of the bonds is sold to the federal government, the balance may be sold at a private sale at not less than par at an interest cost to the urban renewal agency that does not exceed the interest cost to the agency of the part of the bonds sold to the federal government.
    
    (h)  If the officials whose signatures appear on bonds or coupons issued under this section cease to be officials of the urban renewal agency before the delivery of the bonds, their signatures are valid for all purposes as if they had remained in office until delivery.
    
    (i)  In an action involving the validity or enforceability of a bond issued under this subchapter or the security for such a bond, a bond that recites in substance that it was issued by an urban renewal agency in connection with an urban renewal project is conclusively considered to have been issued for those purposes, and the project is conclusively considered to have been conducted in accordance with this chapter.
    
    (j)  A bank, trust company, banker, savings bank and institution, savings and loan association, investment company, and other person conducting a banking or investment business, an insurance company, insurance association, and other person conducting an insurance business, and an executor, administrator, curator, trustee, and other fiduciary may invest a sinking fund, money, or other fund belonging to it or in its control in any bonds or obligations issued by an urban renewal agency under this section.  Those bonds or other obligations must be secured by an agreement between the issuer and the federal government in which the issuer agrees to borrow from the federal government and the federal government agrees to lend to the issuer, before the maturity of the bonds or other obligations, money in an amount that, together with any other money irrevocably committed to the payment of interest on the bonds or other obligations, is sufficient to pay the principal of the bonds or other obligations with interest to maturity.  Under the terms of the agreement the money must be used to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds or other obligations at maturity.  Those bonds and other obligations are authorized security for a public deposit.  Any person may use funds owned or controlled by the person to purchase those bonds or obligations.  This subsection does not relieve a person of a duty to exercise reasonable care in selecting securities.

    Sec. 374.031.  ELECTION REQUIRED.  (a)  A municipality may not use the tax increment method of financing prescribed under this subchapter unless a majority of the qualified voters of the municipality voting on the question approve that method of financing in an election held by the municipality.
    
    (b)  The ballot shall be printed to provide for voting for or against the proposition:  "Use of tax increment financing for urban renewal purposes."
    
    (c)  The election may be held in conjunction with an election held under Section [374.011](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=374.011) or [374.012](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=374.012).

    Sec. 374.032.  TAX INCREMENT FUND.  On approval of an urban renewal plan by the governing body of a municipality and on approval of tax increment financing as required by Section [374.031](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=374.031), the governing body by resolution shall establish a fund known as the tax increment fund.

    Sec. 374.033.  COMPUTATION OF TAX INCREMENTS.  (a)  A tax increment is computed by multiplying the total in property taxes levied and collected by the municipality and all other taxing entities on the taxable real property in an urban renewal project area in a year by a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to that year's market value of all taxable real property in the area minus the tax increment base and the denominator of which is equal to that year's market value of all taxable real property in the area.
    
    (b)  For the purposes of this chapter, only the tax assessor-collector determines the market value of property located in an urban renewal project area during the time that the project exists.  The determination requires the concurrence of the comptroller.  A property owner who is aggrieved by a determination of the tax assessor-collector has the same right of appeal as that provided by law to owners of property not affected by this chapter.
    
    (c)  At the time an urban renewal project is designated by the governing body, the tax assessor-collector shall, with the concurrence of the comptroller, certify to the governing body the market value of property within the boundaries of the urban renewal district.  The tax assessor-collector shall include at its most recently determined market value any property that is taxable at the time that the urban renewal project is designated and shall include at zero any property that is exempt from taxation at the time that the district is designated.
    
    (d)  The tax assessor-collector shall annually certify to the governing body the amount of the captured market value of property within the boundaries of the district and the amount of tax increments produced from that captured market value.  The tax assessor-collector shall make the initial certification not later than one year from the date on which an urban renewal project is designated.
    
    (e)  For any year in which taxes are to be paid into the tax increment fund established under Section [374.032](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=374.032), a taxing entity may not consider any captured market value with respect to an urban renewal project in computing a debt limitation or for any other purpose except to determine the amount to be paid into the tax increment fund.

    Sec. 374.034.  ALLOCATION OF TAX COLLECTIONS AND TAX INCREMENTS;  TAX INCREMENT FUND.  (a)  For the purposes of this chapter, the tax assessor-collector has the sole authority and the duty to collect the taxes levied by the municipality and all other taxing entities on property located within an urban renewal project and to allocate taxes and tax increments in the manner required by this chapter.
    
    (b)  Beginning with the first payment of taxes levied by the municipality or other taxing entity after the time an urban renewal project is designated, the receipts from those taxes shall be allocated and paid as provided by this subsection.  The receipts from the property taxes collected that are produced from the tax increment base shall first be allocated and paid to the municipality or appropriate taxing entity.  All tax increments produced from the captured market value of the property located within the urban renewal project district shall then be deposited into the tax increment fund established for the project.

    Sec. 374.035.  TAX INCREMENT BONDS.  (a)  A municipality may issue tax increment bonds, the proceeds of which may be used to pay redevelopment costs relating to the urban renewal project for which the bonds were issued or to satisfy claims of holders of those bonds.  On the approval of two-thirds of the qualified voters of the municipality, the municipality may also issue refunding bonds for the payment or retirement of tax increment bonds previously issued by the municipality.  The tax increment bonds may be made payable, both as to principal and interest, only from:
    
    (1)  tax increments allocated to and paid into the tax increment fund established by the municipality under Section [374.032](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=374.032);
    
    (2)  private sources;
    
    (3)  contributions or other financial assistance from this state or the United States;  or
    
    (4)  a combination of those methods.
    
    (b)  A tax increment bond issued under this section, with the interest and income from the bond, is exempt from taxation.  The period of maturity of a tax increment bond is limited to a maximum of 20 years from the date of issuance.  Bonds issued under this section must be authorized by a resolution or ordinance of the governing body of the municipality and may be issued in one or more series.  The bond must have the characteristics prescribed by Section [374.026](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=374.026)(e) as provided by the resolution, trust indenture, or mortgage issued in relation to the bond.
    
    (c)  A bond issued under this section may be sold at not less than par at a public sale after notice published in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality and in any other medium of publication determined by the governing body or may be exchanged for other bonds on a par basis.  A bond issued under this section is fully negotiable.
    
    (d)  In an action or proceeding involving the validity or enforceability of a bond issued under this section or the security for such a bond, a bond that recites in substance that it is issued by the municipality in connection with an urban renewal project is conclusively considered to have been issued for those purposes, and the urban renewal project is conclusively considered to have been planned, located, and carried out in accordance with this chapter.
    
    (e)  A bank, trust company, banker, savings bank and institution, savings and loan association, investment company, and other person conducting a banking or investment business, an insurance company, insurance association, and other person conducting an insurance business, and an executor, administrator, curator, trustee, and other fiduciary may invest a sinking fund, money, or other fund belonging to it or in its control in any tax increment bonds issued by a municipality under this section.  The bond is an authorized security for a public deposit.  Any person may use funds owned or controlled by the person to purchase those bonds.  This subsection does not relieve a person of a duty to exercise reasonable care in selecting securities.
    
    (f)  Tax increment bonds may be paid only out of the tax increment fund established under Section [374.032](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=374.032).  The governing body of the municipality may irrevocably pledge all or part of the fund to the payment of those bonds or notes.  The fund or the designated part of the fund may only be used for the payment of those bonds and interest on those bonds until they have been fully paid.  A holder of those bonds or coupons relating to the bonds has a lien against the fund for the payment of the bonds or notes and the interest on them and may protect and enforce that lien by an action at law or in equity.
    
    (g)  To increase the security and marketability of tax increment bonds, the municipality, according to its best judgment, may:
    
    (1)  create a lien for the benefit of the bondholders on a public improvement or public work financed by the bonds or on the revenue from the public improvement or public work;  or
    
    (2)  make covenants and take other action as necessary, convenient, or desirable to additionally secure the bonds or make the bonds more marketable.
    
    (h)  A tax increment bond issued under this section is not a general obligation of the municipality, is not a charge against its general credit or taxing powers, and is not payable other than as provided by this chapter.  The tax increment bond must state those limitations on its face.
    
    (i)  A tax increment bond issued under this section may not be included in computing the debt of the issuing municipality.
    
    (j)  Tax increment bonds may not be issued in an amount exceeding the aggregate costs of implementing the urban renewal plan for the project for which they were issued.

    Sec. 374.036.  DISBURSEMENTS FROM TAX INCREMENT FUND.  (a)  Money may be disbursed from a tax increment fund only to satisfy the claims of holders of tax increment bonds issued in aid of the urban renewal project with respect to which the fund was established or to pay project costs.  In this section, "project costs" means any expenditure made or estimated to be made, or monetary obligations incurred or estimated to be incurred, by the municipality that are listed in an urban renewal project, plus any incidental costs, less any income or revenues other than tax increments, received or reasonably expected to be received by the municipality in connection with the implementation of the urban renewal plan.  Those project costs include:
    
    (1)  capital costs, including:
    
    (A)  the actual costs of the construction of public works or improvements, new buildings, structures, and fixtures;
    
    (B)  the costs of demolition, alteration, remodeling, repair, or reconstruction of existing buildings, structures, and fixtures;
    
    (C)  the costs of acquisition of equipment;  and

    (b)  Real property acquired under this chapter may be made available for public housing if the municipality holds an election at which a majority of the qualified voters voting in the election approve that use of the property.  The municipality shall conduct the election in the manner provided for an election under Section [374.011](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=374.011).
