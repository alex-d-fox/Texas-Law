    (3)  authorize in specific cases a variance from the terms of a zoning regulation if the variance is not contrary to the public interest and, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the regulation would result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of the regulation is observed and substantial justice is done.
    
    (b)  In exercising its authority under Subsection (a)(1), the board may reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, or modify the administrative official's order, requirement, decision, or determination from which an appeal is taken and make the correct order, requirement, decision, or determination, and for that purpose the board has the same authority as the administrative official.

On receiving the notice, the official from whom the appeal is taken shall immediately transmit to the board all the papers constituting the record of the action that is appealed.
    
    (c)  An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action that is appealed unless the official from whom the appeal is taken certifies in writing to the board facts supporting the official's opinion that a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property.  In that case, the proceedings may only be stayed by a restraining order granted by the board or a court of record on application, after notice to the official, if due cause is shown.
    
    (d)  The board shall set a reasonable time for the appeal hearing and shall give public notice of the hearing and due notice to the parties in interest.

    (b)  The petition must be presented within 10 days after the date the decision is filed in the board's office.
    
    (c)  On the presentation of the petition, the court may grant a writ of certiorari directed to the board to review the board's decision.  The writ must indicate the time within which the board's return must be made and served on the petitioner's attorney, which must be after 10 days and may be extended by the court.  Granting of the writ does not stay the proceedings on the decision under appeal, but on application and after notice to the board the court may grant a restraining order if due cause is shown.
    
    (d)  The board's return must be verified and must concisely state any pertinent and material facts that show the grounds of the decision under appeal.  The board is not required to return the original documents on which the board acted but may return certified or sworn copies of the documents or parts of the documents as required by the writ.
    
    (e)  If at the hearing the court determines that testimony is necessary for the proper disposition of the matter, it may take evidence or appoint a referee to take evidence as directed.

    Sec. 231.023.  CONFLICT WITH OTHER LAWS;  EXCEPTIONS.  (a)  If a zoning regulation adopted under this subchapter requires a greater width or size of a yard, court, or other open space, requires a lower building height or fewer number of stories for a building, requires a greater percentage of lot to be left unoccupied, or otherwise imposes higher standards than those required under another statute or local order or regulation, the regulation adopted under this subchapter controls.  If the other statute or local order or regulation imposes higher standards, that statute, order, or regulation controls.
    
    (b)  This subchapter does not authorize the commissioners court to require the removal or destruction of property that exists at the time the court implements this subchapter.
    
    (c)  This subchapter, an order adopted under this subchapter, or a zoning regulation does not apply to the location, construction, maintenance, or use of central office buildings used by a person engaging in providing telephone service to the public or equipment used in connection with those buildings or as part of the telephone system, as necessary to furnish telephone service to the public.

    (3)  authorize in specific cases a variance from the terms of a regulation adopted under this subchapter if the variance is not contrary to the public interest and, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the regulation would result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of the regulation is observed and substantial justice is done.
    
    (b)  In exercising its authority under Subsection (a)(1), the board may reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, or modify the administrative official's order, requirement, decision, or determination from which an appeal is taken and make the correct order, requirement, decision, or determination, and for that purpose the board has the same authority as the administrative official.

The writ must indicate the time within which the board's return must be made and served on the petitioner's attorney, which must be after 10 days and may be extended by the court.  Granting of the writ does not stay the proceedings on the decision under appeal, but on application and after notice to the board the court may grant a restraining order if due cause is shown.
    
    (d)  The board's return must be verified and must concisely state any pertinent and material facts that show the grounds of the decision under appeal.

The commissioners court may take those actions to restrict or prohibit any commercial agricultural enterprise, such as a commercial feed lot, that are reasonably necessary to protect the public health, safety, peace, morals, and general welfare from the dangers of explosion, flooding, vermin, insects, physical injury, contagious disease, contamination of water supplies, radiation, storage of toxic materials, or other hazards.
