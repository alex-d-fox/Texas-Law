    CHAPTER 83. COUNTY TREASURER
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 83.001.  ELECTION.  The county treasurer is elected at each general election in which the office of governor is to be filled for a full term.

    Sec. 83.002.  BOND.  (a)  The county treasurer, before beginning to perform the duties of office, must execute a bond with a surety company authorized to do business in this state as a surety.  The bond must be:
    
    (1)  approved by the commissioners court;
    
    (2)  made payable to the county judge in an amount established by the commissioners court not to exceed one-half of one percent of the largest amount budgeted for general county maintenance and operations for any fiscal year of the county beginning during the term of office preceding the term for which the bond is to be given except that the amount may not be less than $5,000 or more than $500,000; and
    
    (3)  conditioned that the treasurer will  faithfully execute the duties of office.
    
    (b)  The treasurer must take and subscribe the official oath, which must be endorsed on the bond.  The bond and the oath shall be recorded in the county clerk's office.  The commissioners court may, at any time, require the treasurer to obtain a new or additional bond if the court considers the existing bond insufficient or doubtful.  The bond may not exceed the maximum amount provided by Subsection (a).  The bond must be acquired within 20 days after the date notice of the requirement has been given by the commissioners court.  The failure of a treasurer to obtain a bond required by this subsection subjects the treasurer to removal under Section [83.004](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=83.004).
