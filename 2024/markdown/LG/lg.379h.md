    (e)  The aggregate amount of all credit bids in a calendar year shall be considered satisfied by the aggregate expenditure in that calendar year of an amount equal to or greater than the credit bid amount, which expenditures are attributable directly and indirectly to maintenance, rehabilitation, construction, demolition, and remediation activities.

    (l)  A sale of real property to a land bank under this section:
    
    (1)  extinguishes each lien securing payment of the delinquent taxes, penalties, and interest against the property and included in the judgment; and

    (m)  A municipality, and any taxing unit levying property taxes within the geographical jurisdiction of the municipality, may convey tax foreclosed real property owned by the municipality or the taxing unit to the land bank on terms and for an amount of consideration determined by the transferor and the land bank.
