    Sec. 263.152.  DISPOSITION.  (a)  The commissioners court of a county may:
    
    (1)  periodically sell the county's surplus or salvage property by competitive bid or auction, except that competitive bidding or an auction is not necessary if the purchaser is another county or a political subdivision within the county that is selling the surplus or salvage property;
    
    (2)  offer the property as a trade-in for new property of the same general type if the commissioners court considers that action to be in the best interests of the county;
    
    (3)  order any of the property to be destroyed or otherwise disposed of as worthless if the commissioners court undertakes to sell that property under Subdivision (1) and is unable to do so because no bids are made;
    
    (4)  dispose of the property by donating it to a civic or charitable organization located in the county if the commissioners court determines that:
    
    (A)  undertaking to sell the property under Subdivision (1) would likely result in no bids or a bid price that is less than the county's expenses required for the bid process;
    
    (B)  the donation serves a public purpose; and
    
    (C)  the organization will provide the county with adequate consideration, such as relieving the county of transportation or disposal expenses related to the property;
    
    (5)  transfer gambling equipment in the possession of the county following its forfeiture to the state to the Texas Facilities Commission for sale under Section [2175.904](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2175.904), Government Code; or
    
    (6)  order any vehicle retired under a program designed to encourage the use of low-emission vehicles to be crushed and recycled, if practicable, without a competitive bid or auction.
    
    (a-1)  The commissioners court shall remit money received from the Texas Facilities Commission from the sale of gambling equipment under Section [2175.904](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2175.904)(c), Government Code, less administrative expenses incurred by the county in connection with the transfer and sale of the equipment, to the local law enforcement agency that originally seized the equipment.
    
    (b)  If the property is earth-moving, material-handling, road maintenance, or construction equipment, the commissioners court may exercise a repurchase option in a contract in disposing of property under Subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2). The repurchase price of equipment contained in a previously accepted purchase contract is considered a bid under Subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2).
    
    (c)  Disposal under Subsection (a)(3) may be accomplished through a recycling program under which the property is collected, separated, or processed and returned to use in the form of raw materials in the production of new products.

    (2)  pay for the land or interest in land from special flood control funds or other available county funds.
    
    (b)  In a condemnation by the county, the county, after the award by the special commissioners appointed under Chapter [21](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=21), Property Code, may file a declaration of taking adopted by resolution of the commissioners court and signed by the county judge.
    
    (c)  The declaration of taking must contain:
    
    (1)  a declaration that the land or interest in land described in the original petition is taken for a public use and for ultimate conveyance to the United States;
    
    (2)  a description of the land sufficient for the identification of the land;

    (1)  the land is considered to be condemned and taken for the uses specified in the declaration;

On appeal the only issue is the amount of damages due from the county to the owner of the land or interest in land for its taking.
