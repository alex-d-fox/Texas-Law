A local government is a qualified local government for a fiscal year if the amount of lost ad valorem tax revenue calculated under Subsection (c) for that fiscal year is equal to or greater than two percent of the local government's general fund revenue for that fiscal year.
    
    (c)  For the purposes of this section, the amount of a local government's lost ad valorem tax revenue for a fiscal year is calculated by multiplying the ad valorem tax rate adopted by the local government under Section [26.05](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.05), Tax Code, for the tax year in which the fiscal year begins by the total appraised value of all property located in the local government that is granted an exemption from taxation under Section [11.131](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.131), Tax Code, for that tax year.
    
    (d)  A disabled veteran assistance payment made to a qualified local government for a fiscal year is calculated by subtracting from the local government's lost ad valorem tax revenue calculated under Subsection (c) for that fiscal year an amount equal to one percent of the local government's general fund revenue for that fiscal year.
    
    (e)  Not later than April 1 of the first year following the end of a fiscal year for which a qualified local government is entitled to a disabled veteran assistance payment, a qualified local government may submit an application to the comptroller to receive a disabled veteran assistance payment for that fiscal year.  The application must be made on a form prescribed by the comptroller.  The comptroller may require the qualified local government to submit an independent audit otherwise required by law to be prepared for the local government for the fiscal year for which a qualified local government is entitled to the payment.
    
    (f)  A qualified local government that does not submit an application to the comptroller by the date prescribed by Subsection (e) is not entitled to a disabled veteran assistance payment for the fiscal year for which that deadline applies.
    
    (g)  The comptroller shall review each application by a local government to determine whether the local government is entitled to a disabled veteran assistance payment.  If the comptroller determines that the local government is entitled to the payment, the comptroller shall remit the payment from available funds to the qualified local government not later than the 30th day after the date the application for the payment is made.
    
    (h)  The comptroller shall transfer funds to a newly created account in the state treasury for the purpose of reimbursement of local governments under this section.
    
    (i)  The comptroller shall adopt rules necessary to implement this section.
