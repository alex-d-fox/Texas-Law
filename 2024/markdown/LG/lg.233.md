    SUBCHAPTER A. DANGEROUS SUBSTANCES
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 233.001.  REQUIRING REPAIR, REMOVAL, OR DEMOLITION OF BUILDING OR OTHER STRUCTURE.  (a)  If the commissioners court of a county that borders the Gulf of Mexico and is adjacent to a county with a population of more than 3.3 million finds that a bulkhead or other method of shoreline protection, hereafter called "structure," in an unincorporated area of the county is likely to endanger persons or property, the commissioners may:
    
    (1)  order the owner of the structure, the owner's agent, or the owner or occupant of the property on which the structure is located to repair, remove, or demolish the structure or the part of the structure within a specified time; or
    
    (2)  repair, remove, or demolish the structure or the part of the structure at the expense of the county on behalf of the owner of the structure or the owner of the property on which the structure is located and assess the repair, removal, or demolition expenses on the property on which the structure was located.
    
    (b)  The commissioners court shall provide by order for:
    
    (1)  the assessment of repair, removal, or demolition expenses incurred under Subsection (a)(2);
    
    (2)  a method of giving notice of the assessment;  and
    
    (3)  a method of recovering the expenses.
    
    (c)  Promptly after the assessment, the county must file for record, in recordable form in the office of the county clerk in which the property is located, a written notice of the imposition of a lien, if any, that is imposed on the property.  The notice must contain a legal description of the property, the amount of the assessment, and the owner if known.  The lien arises and attaches to the property at the time the notice of the assessment is recorded and indexed in the office of the county clerk in the county in which the property is located.  The notice to secure the assessment is inferior to any previously recorded bona fide mortgage lien attached to the property to which the county's lien attaches if the mortgage lien was filed for record in the office of the county clerk of the county in which the property is located before the date the notice is recorded and indexed in the office of the county clerk.  The assessment lien is superior to all other previously recorded judgment liens.
    
    (d)  A person commits an offense if the person does not comply with an order issued under Subsection (a)(1).  An offense under this section is a Class C misdemeanor.
    
    (e)  This section does not apply to a:
    
    (1)  residential building;  or
    
    (2)  building or other structure that is owned or held in trust by the state or a political subdivision of this state;  or
    
    (3)  building or structure used on or in connection with an agricultural operation.

    Sec. 233.035.  BOARD OF BUILDING LINE ADJUSTMENT.  (a)  The commissioners court may appoint a board of building line adjustment consisting of five freeholders of the county.

    (d)  The board shall hear and decide an appeal in a case in which, because of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, shape, topography, existing building development, or another exceptional and extraordinary situation or condition of a specific piece of property, the strict application of a building line established under this subchapter would result in peculiar and exceptional difficulties or hardships to the owner of the property.  On appeal, the board may authorize a variance from the strict application of the regulation, under conditions imposed by the board, to relieve the hardship or difficulty if that relief can be granted without substantially impairing the intent and purpose of the building line or set-back line.
    
    (e)  With appropriate safeguards, the board shall authorize the construction of an improvement or a structure that may encroach on a building or set-back line.  However, if the county proceeds with projected improvements of the affected road within the time provided by Section [233.034](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=233.034)(c), the owner of the improvement or structure must remove it at no expense to the county.
