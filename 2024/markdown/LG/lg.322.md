    Sec. 322.078.  MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.  (a)  In this section, "fee" includes a fee, charge, or toll.
    
    (b)  The resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds may require that the bonds contain a recital that they are issued pursuant to and in strict conformity with this chapter.  If made, that recital is conclusive evidence of the validity of the bonds and the regularity of their issuance.
    
    (c)  Each bond is exempt from taxation by this state or by a municipal corporation, county, or other political subdivision or taxing district of the state.
    
    (d)  If provided for in the resolution, an indenture securing the bonds may be executed between the board and a corporate trustee.  The resolution may also provide for execution of the indenture by a corporate or individual cotrustee.  In addition to the pledge of revenues, the indenture may grant a mortgage or deed of trust lien on all or any part of the real and personal property of the board.  A corporate trustee or corporate cotrustee must be a trust company or a bank located inside or outside this state that has trust powers.
    
    (e)  Either the resolution or an indenture may contain provisions for protecting or enforcing the rights or remedies of the bondholders as considered by the board to be reasonable, proper, and not in violation of law.  The provisions may include covenants setting forth the duties of the board in reference to the maintenance, operation or repair, and insurance of the facility the revenues of which are pledged, including within the discretion of the board, insurance against loss of use and occupancy.  The provisions may also include covenants for the custody, safeguarding, and application of money received from the sale of the bonds and from the revenues received from the operation of the project.
    
    (f)  Any bank or trust company in this state may act as depository for the proceeds of the bonds, the revenues derived for operation of the facilities the revenues of which are pledged, or for the special funds created to assure payment of principal and interest on the bonds, including reserve funds and accounts.  The depository may furnish indemnity bonds or pledge securities as required by the board.
    
    (g)  The board may select the depository or depositories without the necessity of seeking competitive bids.  The deposits must be secured in the manner required by law for the security of county funds.  The board in the resolution or indenture may bind the board to the use of direct obligations of the United States or obligations unconditionally guaranteed by the United States as security for the deposits.
    
    (h)  The resolution or indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual rights of action of the bondholders.  The resolution may contain other suitable provisions the board considers reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders, including:
    
    (1)  covenants prescribing occurrences that constitute events of default and the terms and conditions on which any or all of the bonds become due, or may be declared to be due, before maturity;  and
    
    (2)  covenants as to the rights, liabilities, powers, and duties arising from the breach by the board of any of its duties or obligations.
    
    (i)  Any bondholder or a trustee for a bondholder may by mandamus or other proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction enforce the bondholder's rights against the board or its agents and employees or against any lessee of any facility the revenues of which are pledged to the bonds, including the right to require the board to impose, establish, and enforce fees sufficient and effective to carry out the agreements contained in the resolution or indenture, the right to perform all agreements and covenants in the resolution and the duties arising from the resolution or indenture, and the right in the event of default as defined in the resolution or indenture to apply for and obtain the appointment of a receiver for any of the properties involved.  If a receiver is appointed, the receiver shall enter and take possession of the facilities mortgaged and the revenues of which have been pledged.  The receiver shall retain possession until the board is no longer in default or until relieved by a court, and shall collect and receive all revenues and fees arising from the retained property.  The receiver may make and renew contracts or leases with the approval of the court in the same manner as the board.  The receiver shall dispose of and apply the money in accordance with the obligations of the board under the resolution or indenture and as the court may direct.
    
    (j)  The resolution or indenture may contain provisions to the effect that while the revenues of the park facilities are pledged to the payment of bonds, no free service may be rendered by any of those facilities for which fees are to be effective under the resolution.
    
    (k)  The bonds are legally authorized investments for banks, savings banks, trust companies, savings and loan associations, insurance companies, fiduciaries, trustees, and for the sinking funds and other funds of this state.  The bonds are eligible to secure the deposit of any municipal corporation, county, political subdivision, public agency, or taxing district in this state, and the bonds are lawful and sufficient security for those deposits to the extent of their face value when accompanied by all unmatured appurtenant coupons.
    
    (l)  The resolution, the indenture, and this chapter constitute an irrevocable contract between the board and the bondholders.
