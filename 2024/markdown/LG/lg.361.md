    Sec. 361.028.  EXTENT TO WHICH EACH STATE'S LAW APPLIES AT JUSTICE CENTER.  (a)  Except as otherwise provided by this subchapter, the law of both states that relates to the rights, duties, liabilities, privileges, and immunities arising from conduct applies to conduct that occurs in any part of the justice center.  If it is impossible for a person in the center to conform the person's conduct to the law of both states, the person may choose which state's law governs the conduct.  If the person elects to follow the law of the other state, the conflicting law of this state does not apply to the conduct.
    
    (b)  The physical plant of the justice center and the equipment and facilities used by personnel of both states who are employed at the center are constructively located in both states.
    
    (c)  Except as provided by Subsection (d), property located in any part of the justice center that is owned by or is in the possession of a person who is in custody at, or who is summoned to appear in, the center, is constructively located in the state under the law of which the person was taken into custody or was summoned to appear.
    
    (d)  Subsection (a) applies to conduct committed in the justice center that constitutes an offense relating to the possession of property.  Subsection (a) also applies to a person's exercise of a duty relating to property located in the justice center.
    
    (e)  Property that is ordered by a court to be produced in the justice center or that is in the possession of a peace officer or a party to a proceeding for use as evidence before a court holding a proceeding in the center is constructively located in the state in which the court has jurisdiction.
    
    (f)  Any property located in the justice center that is not covered by Subsection (c), (d), or (e) is constructively located in both states.
    
    (g)  The law of the state in which property is constructively located applies to that property to the same extent that that law would apply if the property were actually located in that state.  If property is constructively located in only one state, the law of the state in which the property is not constructively located applies to that property only to the extent that the law of that state would apply if the property were actually located outside that state.
    
    (h)  Except as otherwise provided by this subchapter, the courts of both states have concurrent jurisdiction over the geographic area covered by the justice center.  However, the state in which a prosecution for an offense committed in the justice center is first instituted may exercise its jurisdiction to the exclusion of the other state's jurisdiction unless the prosecution is terminated without the attachment of jeopardy under the law of the state of the initial prosecution.  For the purposes of this subsection, prosecution is instituted in this state on the filing of an indictment, an information, or a complaint.  The attachment of jeopardy in this state is determined by Article [27.05](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=27.05), Code of Criminal Procedure.

    Sec. 361.029.  ARREST, PROSECUTION, EXTRADITION, AND SERVICE OF PROCESS AT JUSTICE CENTER.  (a)  A person who is in the justice center in the custody, under the law of this state, of a peace officer or center personnel:
    
    (1)  is constructively present in this state while the person is in custody in the part of the center located in the other state;
    
    (2)  may be prosecuted for an offense against the law of this state without extradition;  and
    
    (3)  may be personally served with process in any part of the center for a proceeding in this state.
    
    (b)  A person who is in the justice center in the custody, under the law of the other state, of a peace officer or center personnel:
    
    (1)  is constructively present in the other state while the person is in custody in the part of the center located in this state;
    
    (2)  may not be prosecuted for an offense against the law of this state without extradition;  and
    
    (3)  may not be personally served with process in any part of the center for a proceeding in this state.
    
    (c)  This state agrees that a person who is in the justice center in the custody, under the law of the other state, of a peace officer or center personnel may be:
    
    (1)  prosecuted for an offense against the law of the other state without extradition;  and
    
    (2)  personally served with process in any part of the center for a proceeding in the other state.
    
    (d)  Justice center personnel or a peace officer of either state may transfer across the state line in the center a person who is in custody in the center under the law of either state and may exercise control over the person on both sides of the state line.
    
    (e)  A person who is present in the justice center but who has not been confined in the center, taken to the center under arrest, or summoned to appear in the center, may be arrested without extradition in any part of the center for an offense against the law of either state.  Extradition of a person arrested in the justice center under those circumstances is not required for prosecution of the person if the person is actually present in any part of the center or in the state of the prosecution at the time of the prosecution.
    
    (f)  A person who is summoned to appear in the justice center under the law of this state:
    
    (1)  is constructively present in this state while that person is appearing under the summons in the part of the center located in the other state;
    
    (2)  may be arrested in any part of the center for an offense committed against the law of this state and prosecuted for that offense without extradition if the person is actually present in any part of the center or in this state at the time of the prosecution;  and
    
    (3)  may be personally served with process in any part of the center for a proceeding in this state.
    
    (g)  A person who is summoned to appear in the justice center under the law of the other state:
    
    (1)  is constructively present in the other state while that person is appearing under the summons in the part of the center located in this state;
    
    (2)  may not be arrested, without extradition, under the law of this state in any part of the center for an offense against the law of this state;  and
    
    (3)  may not be personally served with process in any part of the center for a proceeding in this state.
    
    (h)  This state agrees that a person who is summoned to appear in the justice center under the law of the other state may be:
    
    (1)  arrested in any part of the center for an offense against the law of the other state and prosecuted for that offense without extradition if the person is actually present in any part of the center or in the other state at the time of the prosecution;  and
    
    (2)  personally served with process in any part of the center for a proceeding in the other state.
    
    (i)  If a person in the justice center is constructively present in one state under this section, the law of the state in which the person is not constructively present may be applied to the person only to the extent that the law of that state would apply if the person were actually outside that state.  However, the law applicable to that person's conduct while in the justice center is governed by Section [361.028](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=361.028), and the question of whether extradition is required to arrest or prosecute that person for an offense committed in the center is governed by this section.
    
    (j)  A peace officer of this state may:
    
    (1)  arrest a person under the law of this state in the part of the justice center located in the other state for an offense against the law of this state if that peace officer is authorized to make that arrest in the part of the center located in this state;  and
    
    (2)  arrest a person under the law of the other state in any part of the center for an offense against the law of the other state if a peace officer of the other state is authorized to make that arrest in the part of the center located in the other state.
    
    (k)  This state agrees that a peace officer of the other state may:
    
    (1)  arrest a person under the law of this state in any part of the justice center for an offense against the law of this state if a peace officer of this state is authorized to make that arrest in the part of the center located in this state;  and
    
    (2)  arrest a person under the law of the other state in the part of the justice center located in this state for an offense against the law of the other state if that peace officer is authorized to make that arrest in the part of the center located in the other state.
    
    (l)  Notwithstanding Sections 3 and 6, Article [51.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=51.13), Code of Criminal Procedure, the governor of this state may recognize a demand for the extradition of a person charged with a crime in the other state if the demand alleges that any element of the offense occurred in any part of the justice center.
