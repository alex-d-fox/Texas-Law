    (3)  a statement of the purpose of extraterritorial jurisdiction designation as provided by Section [42.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=42.001); and
    
    (4)  a brief description of each municipal ordinance that would be applicable, as authorized by Section [212.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=212.003), in the area that would be newly included in the municipality's extraterritorial jurisdiction.
    
    (f-2)  In addition to the notice requirements under Subsection (f), a home-rule municipality, before the 90th day after the date the municipality adopts or amends an annexation plan under this section, shall create, or contract for the creation of, and make publicly available a digital map that identifies the area proposed for annexation and any area that would be newly included in the municipality's extraterritorial jurisdiction as a result of the proposed annexation.  A digital map required under this subsection must be made available without charge and in a format widely used by common geographic information system software or in any other widely used electronic format if the municipality does not have common geographic information system software.  If the municipality maintains an Internet website, the municipality shall make the digital map available on the municipality's website.

    Sec. 43.0545.  ANNEXATION OF CERTAIN ADJACENT AREAS.  (a)  A municipality may not annex an area that is located in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the municipality only because the area is contiguous to municipal territory that is less than 1,000 feet in width at its narrowest point.
    
    (b)  A municipality may not annex an area that is located in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the municipality only because the area is contiguous to municipal territory that:
    
    (1)  was annexed before September 1, 1999;  and
    
    (2)  was in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the municipality at the time of annexation only because the territory was contiguous to municipal territory that was less than 1,000 feet in width at its narrowest point.
    
    (c)  Subsections (a) and (b) do not apply to an area:

    Sec. 43.055.  MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF ANNEXATION EACH YEAR.  (a)  In a calendar year, a municipality may not annex a total area greater than 10 percent of the incorporated area of the municipality as of January 1 of that year, plus any amount of area carried over to that year under Subsection (b).  In determining the total area annexed in a calendar year, an area annexed for limited purposes is included, but an annexed area is not included if it is:
    
    (1)  annexed at the request of a majority of the qualified voters of the area and the owners of at least 50 percent of the land in the area;
    
    (2)  owned by the municipality, a county, the state, or the federal government and used for a public purpose;

    Sec. 43.056.  PROVISION OF SERVICES TO ANNEXED AREA.  (a)  This section applies to a service plan under Section [43.065](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=43.065).
    
    (b)  The service plan, which must be completed before the annexation, must include a program under which the municipality will provide full municipal services in the annexed area no later than 2-1/2 years after the effective date of the annexation, in accordance with Subsection (e), unless certain services cannot reasonably be provided within that period and the municipality proposes a schedule for providing those services, and must include a list of all services required by this section to be provided under the plan.  If the municipality proposes a schedule to extend the period for providing certain services, the schedule must provide for the provision of full municipal services no later than 4-1/2 years after the effective date of the annexation.  However, under the program if the municipality provides any of the following services within the corporate boundaries of the municipality before annexation, the municipality must provide those services in the area proposed for annexation on the effective date of the annexation of the area:
    
    (1)  police protection;
    
    (2)  fire protection;
    
    (3)  emergency medical services;
    
    (4)  solid waste collection, except as provided by Subsection (o);
    
    (5)  operation and maintenance of water and wastewater facilities in the annexed area that are not within the service area of another water or wastewater utility;
    
    (6)  operation and maintenance of roads and streets, including road and street lighting;
    
    (7)  operation and maintenance of parks, playgrounds, and swimming pools; and
    
    (8)  operation and maintenance of any other publicly owned facility, building, or service.
    
    (c)  For purposes of this section, "full municipal services" means services provided by the annexing municipality within its full-purpose boundaries, including water and wastewater services and excluding gas or electrical service.
    
    (d)  Repealed by Acts 2017, 85th Leg., 1st C.S., Ch. 6 (S.B. [6](http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/851/billtext/html/SB00006F.HTM)), Sec. 55(a), eff. December 1, 2017.
    
    (e)  The service plan must also include a program under which the municipality will initiate after the effective date of the annexation the acquisition or construction of capital improvements necessary for providing municipal services adequate to serve the area.  The construction shall be substantially completed within the period provided in the service plan.  The service plan may be amended to extend the period for construction if the construction is proceeding with all deliberate speed. The acquisition or construction of the facilities shall be accomplished by purchase, lease, or other contract or by the municipality succeeding to the powers, duties, assets, and obligations of a conservation and reclamation district as authorized or required by law.  The construction of the facilities shall be accomplished in a continuous process and shall be completed as soon as reasonably possible, consistent with generally accepted local engineering and architectural standards and practices.  However, the municipality does not violate this subsection if the construction process is interrupted for any reason by circumstances beyond the direct control of the municipality.  The requirement that construction of capital improvements must be substantially completed within the period provided in the service plan does not apply to a development project or proposed development project within an annexed area if the annexation of the area was initiated by petition or request of the owners of land in the annexed area and the municipality and the landowners have subsequently agreed in writing that the development project within that area, because of its size or projected manner of development by the developer, is not reasonably expected to be completed within that period.
    
    (f)  A service plan may not:
    
    (1)  require the creation of another political subdivision;
    
    (2)  require a landowner in the area to fund the capital improvements necessary to provide municipal services in a manner inconsistent with Chapter [395](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=395) unless otherwise agreed to by the landowner;
    
    (3)  provide services in the area in a manner that would have the effect of reducing by more than a negligible amount the level of fire and police protection and emergency medical services provided within the corporate boundaries of the municipality before annexation;
    
    (4)  provide services in the area in a manner that would have the effect of reducing by more than a negligible amount the level of fire and police protection and emergency medical services provided within the area before annexation; or
    
    (5)  cause a reduction in fire and police protection and emergency medical services within the area to be annexed below that of areas within the corporate boundaries of the municipality with similar topography, land use, and population density.
    
    (g)  If the annexed area had a lower level of services, infrastructure, and infrastructure maintenance than the level of services, infrastructure, and infrastructure maintenance provided within the corporate boundaries of the municipality before annexation, a service plan must provide the annexed area with a level of services, infrastructure, and infrastructure maintenance that is comparable to the level of services, infrastructure, and infrastructure maintenance available in other parts of the municipality with topography, land use, and population density similar to those reasonably contemplated or projected in the area.  If the annexed area had a level of services, infrastructure, and infrastructure maintenance equal to the level of services, infrastructure, and infrastructure maintenance provided within the corporate boundaries of the municipality before annexation, a service plan must maintain that same level of services, infrastructure, and infrastructure maintenance.  Except as provided by this subsection, if the annexed area had a level of services superior to the level of services provided within the corporate boundaries of the municipality before annexation, a service plan must provide the annexed area with a level of services that is comparable to the level of services available in other parts of the municipality with topography, land use, and population density similar to those reasonably contemplated or projected in the area.  If the annexed area had a level of services for operating and maintaining the infrastructure of the area, including the facilities described by Subsections (b)(5)-(8), superior to the level of services provided within the corporate boundaries of the municipality before annexation, a service plan must provide for the operation and maintenance of the infrastructure of the annexed area at a level of services that is equal or superior to that level of services.
    
    (h)  Repealed by Acts 2017, 85th Leg., 1st C.S., Ch. 6 (S.B. [6](http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/851/billtext/html/SB00006F.HTM)), Sec. 55(a), eff. December 1, 2017.
    
    (i)  If only a part of the area to be annexed is actually annexed, the governing body shall direct the department to prepare a revised service plan for that part.
    
    (j)  The proposed service plan must be made available for public inspection and explained to the inhabitants of the area at the public hearings held under Section [43.063](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=43.063).  The plan may be amended through negotiation at the hearings, but the provision of any service may not be deleted.  On completion of the public hearings, the service plan shall be attached to the ordinance annexing the area and approved as part of the ordinance.
    
    (k)  On approval by the governing body, the service plan is a contractual obligation that is not subject to amendment or repeal except that if the governing body determines at the public hearings required by this subsection that changed conditions or subsequent occurrences make the service plan unworkable or obsolete, the governing body may amend the service plan to conform to the changed conditions or subsequent occurrences.  An amended service plan must provide for services that are comparable to or better than those established in the service plan before amendment.  Before any amendment is adopted, the governing body must provide an opportunity for interested persons to be heard at public hearings called and held in the manner provided by Section [43.063](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=43.063).
    
    (l)  A service plan is valid for 10 years.  Renewal of the service plan is at the discretion of the municipality.   A person residing or owning land in an annexed area may enforce a service plan by applying for a writ of mandamus not later than the second anniversary of the date the person knew or should have known that the municipality was not complying with the service plan.  If a writ of mandamus is applied for, the municipality has the burden of proving that the services have been provided in accordance with the service plan in question.  If a court issues a writ under this subsection, the court:
    
    (1)  must provide the municipality the option of disannexing the area within a reasonable period specified by the court;
    
    (2)  may require the municipality to comply with the service plan in question before a reasonable date specified by the court if the municipality does not disannex the area within the period prescribed by the court under Subdivision (1);
    
    (3)  may require the municipality to refund to the landowners of the annexed area money collected by the municipality from those landowners for services to the area that were not provided;
    
    (4)  may assess a civil penalty against the municipality, to be paid to the state in an amount as justice may require, for the period in which the municipality is not in compliance with the service plan;
    
    (5)  may require the parties to participate in mediation; and
    
    (6)  may require the municipality to pay the person's costs and reasonable attorney's fees in bringing the action for the writ.
    
    (m)  This section does not require that a uniform level of full municipal services be provided to each area of the municipality if different characteristics of topography, land use, and population density constitute a sufficient basis for providing different levels of service.  Any disputes regarding the level of services provided under this subsection are resolved in the same manner provided by Subsection (l).  Nothing in this subsection modifies the requirement under Subsection (g) for a service plan to provide a level of services in an annexed area that is equal or superior to the level of services provided within the corporate boundaries of the municipality before annexation.  To the extent of any conflict between this subsection and Subsection (g), Subsection (g) prevails.
    
    (n)  Before the second anniversary of the date an area is included within the corporate boundaries of a municipality by annexation, the municipality may not:
    
    (1)  prohibit the collection of solid waste in the area by a privately owned solid waste management service provider; or
    
    (2)  offer solid waste management services in the area unless a privately owned solid waste management service provider is unavailable.
    
    (o)  A municipality is not required to provide solid waste collection services under Subsection (b) to a person who continues to use the services of a privately owned solid waste management service provider as provided by Subsection (n).

    Sec. 43.0565.  ACCESS TO SERVICES BY CERTAIN MUNICIPALITIES IN ANNEXED AREA.  (a)  A municipality with a population of 350,000 or less shall provide access to services provided to an annexed area under a service plan described by Section [43.056](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=43.056) that is identical or substantially similar to access to those services in the municipality.

(a)  This section applies only to a municipality that includes solid waste collection services in the list of services that will be provided in the area proposed for annexation on or before the second anniversary of the effective date of the annexation of the area under a written agreement under Section [43.0672](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=43.0672) or a resolution under Section [43.0682](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=43.0682) or [43.0692](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=43.0692).
    
    (b)  A municipality is not required to provide solid waste collection services to a person who continues to use the services of a privately owned solid waste management service provider as provided by Subsection (c).

    Sec. 43.0662.  AUTHORITY OF MUNICIPALITY WITH POPULATION OF 74,000 TO 99,700 IN URBAN COUNTY TO ANNEX SMALL, SURROUNDED GENERAL-LAW MUNICIPALITY.  (a)  Notwithstanding Subchapter C-4 or C-5, a municipality that has a population of 74,000 to 99,700, that is located wholly or partly in a county with a population of more than 1.8 million, and that completely surrounds and is contiguous to a general-law municipality with a population of less than 600, may annex the general-law municipality as provided by this section.
    
    (b)  The governing body of the smaller municipality may adopt an ordinance ordering an election on the question of consenting to the annexation of the smaller municipality by the larger municipality.  The governing body of the smaller municipality shall adopt the ordinance if it receives a petition to do so signed by a number of qualified voters of the municipality equal to at least 10 percent of the number of voters of the municipality who voted in the most recent general election.  If the ordinance ordering the election is to be adopted as a result of a petition, the ordinance shall be adopted within 30 days after the date the petition is received.
    
    (c)  The ordinance ordering the election must provide for the submission of the question at an election to be held on the first uniform election date prescribed by Chapter [41](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=EL&Value=41), Election Code, that occurs after the 30th day after the date the ordinance is adopted and that affords enough time to hold the election in the manner required by law.
    
    (d)  Within 10 days after the date on which the election is held, the governing body of the smaller municipality shall canvass the election returns and by resolution shall declare the results of the election.  If a majority of the votes received is in favor of the annexation, the secretary of the smaller municipality or other appropriate municipal official shall forward by certified mail to the secretary of the larger municipality a certified copy of the resolution.
    
    (e)  The larger municipality, within 90 days after the date the resolution is received, must complete the annexation by ordinance in accordance with its municipal charter or the general laws of the state.  If the annexation is not completed within the 90-day period, any annexation proceeding is void and the larger municipality may not annex the smaller municipality under this section.  However, the failure to complete the annexation as provided by this subsection does not prevent the smaller municipality from holding a new election on the question to enable the larger municipality to annex the smaller municipality as provided by this section.
    
    (f)  If the larger municipality completes the annexation within the prescribed period, the incorporation of the smaller municipality is abolished.  The records, public property, public buildings, money on hand, credit accounts, and other assets of the smaller municipality become the property of the larger municipality and shall be turned over to the officers of that municipality.  The offices in the smaller municipality are abolished and the persons holding those offices are not entitled to further remuneration or compensation.  All outstanding liabilities of the smaller municipality are assumed by the larger municipality.
    
    (g)  In the annexation ordinance, the larger municipality shall adopt, for application in the area zoned by the smaller municipality, the identical comprehensive zoning ordinance that the smaller municipality applied to the area at the time of the election.  Any attempted annexation of the smaller municipality that does not include the adoption of that comprehensive zoning ordinance is void.  That comprehensive zoning ordinance may not be repealed or amended for a period of 10 years unless the written consent of the landowners who own at least two-thirds of the surface land of the annexed smaller municipality is obtained.
    
    (h)  If the annexed smaller municipality has on hand any bond funds for public improvements that are not appropriated or contracted for, the funds shall be kept in a separate special fund to be used only for public improvements in the area for which the bonds were voted.
    
    (i)  On the annexation, all claims, fines, debts, or taxes due and payable to the smaller municipality become due and payable to the larger municipality and shall be collected by it.  If taxes for the year in which the annexation occurs have been assessed in the smaller municipality before the annexation, the amounts assessed remain as the amounts due and payable from the inhabitants of the smaller municipality for that year.
    
    (j)  This section does not affect a charter provision of a home-rule municipality.  This section grants additional power to the municipality and is cumulative of the municipal charter.

    Sec. 43.071.  AUTHORITY TO ANNEX WATER OR SEWER DISTRICT.  (a)  In this section, "water or sewer district" means a district or authority created under Article III, Section 52, Subsections (b)(1) and (2), or under Article XVI, Section [59](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=16.59), of the Texas Constitution that provides or proposes to provide, as its principal function, water services or sewer services or both to household users.  The term does not include a district or authority the primary function of which is the wholesale distribution of water.
    
    (b)  A municipality may not annex area in a water or sewer district unless it annexes the entire part of the district that is outside the municipality's boundaries.  This restriction does not apply to the annexation of area in a water or sewer district if the district is wholly or partly in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of more than one municipality.
    
    (c)  An annexation subject to Subsection (b) is exempt from the provisions of this chapter that limit annexation authority to a municipality's extraterritorial jurisdiction if:
    
    (1)  immediately before the annexation, at least one-half of the area of the water or sewer district is in the municipality or its extraterritorial jurisdiction;  and
    
    (2)  the municipality does not annex in the annexation proceeding any area outside its extraterritorial jurisdiction except the part of the district that is outside its extraterritorial jurisdiction.
    
    (d)  Area annexed under Subsection (b) is included in computing the amount of area that a municipality may annex under Section [43.055](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=43.055) in a calendar year.  If the area to be annexed exceeds the amount of area the municipality would otherwise be able to annex, the municipality may annex the area but may not annex additional area during the remainder of that calendar year, except area subject to Subsection (b) and area that is excluded from the computation under Section [43.055](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=43.055).
    
    (e)  Subsections (b)-(d) do not apply to the annexation of:
    
    (1)  an area within a water or sewer district if:
    
    (A)  the governing body of the district consents to the annexation;
    
    (B)  the owners in fee simple of the area to be annexed consent to the annexation; and
    
    (C)  the annexed area does not exceed 525 feet in width at its widest point;
    
    (2)  a water or sewer district that has a noncontiguous part that is not within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the municipality;
    
    (3)  a part of a special utility district created or operating under Chapter [65](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&Value=65), Water Code; or
    
    (4)  a property by a municipality with a population of less than 3,000 if the governing body of a water or sewer district the boundaries of which include the property consents to the annexation.
    
    (f)  To annex the entire part of a water or sewer district that is outside the municipality's boundaries, a general-law municipality incorporated after 1983 that is, after incorporation of the district, incorporated over all or any part of the district may annex territory by ordinance without the consent of the inhabitants or property owners of the territory.
    
    (g)  For an annexation of an area in a water or sewer district that is wholly or partly in the overlapping extraterritorial jurisdiction of two or more municipalities, any one of those municipalities is not required to obtain under Section [42.023](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=42.023) the written consent of any of the other municipalities in order to annex the area if:
    
    (1)  the area contains less than 100 acres;
    
    (2)  the annexing municipality, before June 1, 2005, annexed more than 50 percent of the territory of the water or sewer district, as the district existed on the date of its creation; and
    
    (3)  the entire water or sewer district would be contained in the annexing municipality after completion of the annexation.

    Sec. 43.0712.  INVALIDATION OF ANNEXATION OF SPECIAL DISTRICT;  REIMBURSEMENT OF DEVELOPER.  (a)  If a municipality enacts an ordinance to annex a special district and assumes control and operation of utilities within the district, and the annexation is invalidated by a final judgment of a court after all appeals have been exhausted, the municipality is deemed, by enactment of its annexation ordinance, to have acquired title to utilities owned by a developer within the special district and is obligated to pay the developer all amounts related to the utilities as provided in Section [43.0715](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=43.0715).
    
    (b)  Upon resumption of the functions of the special district:
    
    (1)  the municipality shall succeed to the contractual rights of the developer to be reimbursed by the special district for the utilities the municipality acquires from the developer;  and
    
    (2)  the special district shall resume the use of the utilities acquired and paid for by the municipality and shall thereafter acquire the utilities from the municipality and reimburse the municipality for amounts the municipality paid the developer.  The payment to the municipality shall be governed by the requirements of the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission.

    Sec. 43.0715.  ANNEXATION OF WATER-RELATED SPECIAL DISTRICT:  REIMBURSEMENT OF LANDOWNER OR DEVELOPER;  CONTINUATION OF DISTRICT AND TAXING AUTHORITY.  (a)  In this section:
    
    (1)  "Special district" means a political subdivision one purpose of which is to supply fresh water for domestic or commercial use or to furnish sanitary sewer services or drainage.
    
    (2)  "Delinquent sum" means the sum a municipality has failed to timely pay to a landowner or developer under Subsection (b).
    
    (b)  If a municipality with a population of less than 1.5 million annexes a special district for full or limited purposes and the annexation precludes or impairs the ability of the district to issue bonds, the municipality shall, prior to the effective date of the annexation, pay in cash to the landowner or developer of the district a sum equal to all actual costs and expenses incurred by the landowner or developer in connection with the district that the district has, in writing, agreed to pay and that would otherwise have been eligible for reimbursement from bond proceeds under the rules and requirements of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality as such rules and requirements exist on the date of annexation. 
    
    (c)  At the time notice of the municipality's intent to annex the land within the district is first given in accordance with Section [43.0683](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=43.0683) or [43.0693](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=43.0693), as applicable, the municipality shall proceed to initiate and complete a report for each developer conducted in accordance with the format approved by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for audits.  In the event the municipality is unable to complete the report prior to the effective date of the annexation as a result of the developer's failure to provide information to the municipality which cannot be obtained from other sources, the municipality shall obtain from the district the estimated costs of each project previously undertaken by a developer which are eligible for reimbursement.  The amount of such costs, as estimated by the district, shall be escrowed by the municipality for the benefit of the persons entitled to receive payment in an insured interest-bearing account with a financial institution authorized to do business in the state.  To compensate the developer for the municipality's use of the infrastructure facilities pending the determination of the reimbursement amount, all interest accrued on the escrowed funds shall be paid to the developer whether or not the annexation is valid.  Upon placement of the funds in the escrow account, the annexation may become effective.  In the event a municipality timely escrows all estimated reimbursable amounts as required by this subsection and all such amounts, determined to be owed, including interest, are subsequently disbursed to the developer within five days of final determination in immediately available funds as required by this section, no penalties or interest shall accrue during the pendency of the escrow.  Either the municipality or developer may, by written notice to the other party, require disputes regarding the amount owed under this section to be subject to nonbinding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association.
    
    (d)  A delinquent sum incurs a penalty of six percent of the amount of the sum for the first calendar month it is delinquent plus one percent for each additional month or portion of a month the sum remains unpaid.  For an annexation occurring prior to the effective date of the changes in law made by this Act in amending Subsection (b), a delinquent sum begins incurring a penalty on the first day of the eighth month following the month in which the municipality enacted its annexation ordinance.  For an annexation occurring after the effective date of this Act, a delinquent sum begins incurring a penalty on the first day after the date the municipality enacts its annexation ordinance.

    Sec. 43.072.  AUTHORITY TO ANNEX MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT BY HOME-RULE MUNICIPALITY.  (a)  This section applies to a municipal utility district that is located entirely in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of a single general-law municipality and that has a common boundary with at least one home-rule municipality.
    
    (b)  A home-rule municipality having a common boundary with a district subject to this section may annex the area of the district if:
    
    (1)  the annexation is approved by a majority of the qualified voters who vote on the question at an election held under this section;
    
    (2)  the annexation is completed before the date that is one year after the date of the election;  and
    
    (3)  all the area of the district is annexed.
    
    (c)  Area annexed under Subsection (b) is included in computing the amount of area that a municipality may annex under Section [43.055](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=43.055) in a calendar year.  If the area to be annexed exceeds the amount of area the municipality would otherwise be able to annex, the municipality may annex the area but may not annex additional area during the remainder of that calendar year, except area subject to Subsection (b) and area that is excluded from the computation under Section [43.055](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=43.055).
    
    (d)  Annexation of area under this section is exempt from the provisions of this chapter that prohibit:
    
    (1)  a municipality from annexing area outside its extraterritorial jurisdiction;
    
    (2)  annexation of area narrower than the minimum width prescribed by Section [43.054](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=43.054); or
    
    (3)  reduction of the extraterritorial jurisdiction of a municipality without the written consent of the municipality's governing body.
    
    (e)  If the district is composed of two or more tracts, at least one of which is not contiguous to the home-rule municipality, the fact that the annexation will result in one or more parts of the home-rule municipality being not contiguous to the rest of the municipality does not affect the municipality's authority to annex the district.
    
    (f)  The extraterritorial jurisdiction of a home-rule municipality is not expanded by the annexation of area under this section.
    
    (g)  The board of directors of the district may order an election under this section.  The board shall conduct the election in the area composed of the district and the general-law municipality.  A person who is qualified to vote in the general-law municipality or the district is eligible to vote in the election.
    
    (h)  The board of directors shall set the date of the election for the first uniform election date that falls on or after the 30th day after the date of the order.  If a state law prescribing uniform election dates is not in effect on the date of the order, the board shall set the election for a date that falls on or after the 30th day but before the 60th day after the date of the order.
    
    (i)  The board of directors shall give notice of the election in the manner provided for an election of the members of the board.  The ballot for the election shall be printed to provide for voting for or against the proposition:  "Authorizing the municipality of (name of the home-rule municipality) to annex the unincorporated area of the (name of the district)."
    
    (j)  Promptly after the board of directors declares the result of the election:
    
    (1)  the board shall mail or deliver a certified copy of the resolution declaring the result of the election to the mayor and the secretary of each of the two affected municipalities;  and
    
    (2)  if the election authorizes annexation of the district by the home-rule municipality, the board shall file a certified copy of the resolution in the deed records of each county in which the district is located.
    
    (k)  During the time that an election under this section is pending, the general-law municipality may not annex area in the district.  For the purposes of this requirement, an election is pending during the period that begins on the date the board of directors adopts the election order and ends on the date the board declares the result of the election.  If, on the date the election order is adopted, the general-law municipality has instituted but not completed proceedings to annex area in the district, the general-law municipality may complete the annexation while the election is pending.  If proceedings are completed while the election is pending, the annexation, to the extent that it includes area in the district, takes effect only if the election results in the defeat of the question and, in that case, it takes effect on the date the result of the election is officially declared.
    
    (l)  If the question is approved, the period during which the general-law municipality is prohibited from annexing area in the district is extended to the date that is one year after the date of the election.
    
    (m)  If a district holds an election under this section, the district may not hold another election under this section before the date that is one year after the date of the earlier election, except that if an election is held on a uniform election date prescribed by law, the subsequent election may be held on the corresponding uniform election date of the following year.

    Sec. 43.073.  ABOLITION OF, OR DIVISION OF FUNCTIONS OF, LEVEE IMPROVEMENT DISTRICT ANNEXED BY MUNICIPALITY WITH POPULATION OF MORE THAN 500,000.  (a)  This section applies to a municipality with a population of more than 500,000 that annexes all or part of the area in a levee improvement district organized under the laws of this state.
    
    (b)  If the municipality annexes all the area in the district, the municipality:
    
    (1)  shall take over the property and other assets of the district;
    
    (2)  assumes all the debts, liabilities, and obligations of the district;  and
    
    (3)  shall perform all the functions of the district, including the provision of services.
    
    (c)  The district is abolished on the annexation of all of its area by the municipality.  The abolition of the district does not impair or otherwise affect a contract between the district and a flood control district or other governmental agency for the operation or maintenance of levees or other flood control works, but the municipality assumes the rights and obligations of the district under the contract.  On the annexation of all of the area of the district, the municipality may refund, in whole or in part, any outstanding bonded indebtedness and may provide for a sufficient sinking fund to meet any refunding bonds issued.
    
    (d)  If the municipality annexes only part of the area in the district, the governing bodies of the municipality and the district may make contracts relating to the division and allocation between themselves of their duplicate and overlapping powers, duties, and other functions and relating to the use, management, control, purchase, conveyance, assumption, and disposition of the property and other assets, debts, liabilities, and obligations of the district.  The amount of taxes levied by the district against a parcel of real estate subsequently annexed by the municipality shall be credited against any property taxes levied against the parcel by the municipality.
    
    (e)  If the municipality annexes only part of the area in the district, the district may contract with the municipality for the municipal operation of the district's utility systems and other property and for the transfer, conveyance, or sale of those systems and that property, regardless of kind or location inside or outside municipal boundaries, to the municipality on terms to which the governing bodies of the district and municipality agree.  That operating contract may extend for a period, not to exceed 30 years, stipulated in the contract and is subject to amendment, renewal, or termination by the mutual consent of the governing bodies.  The contract may not impair the obligation of another contract of the municipality or district.  In the absence of such a contract, the district may continue to exercise, unaffected by the annexation, the powers, duties, and other functions granted or imposed on the district by law.  The municipality may not be required to perform any drainage functions in the district.  The municipality may, with the consent of the district, construct and maintain drainage facilities in the district that are consistent with the reclamation plan of the district.  The municipality may perform all other municipal functions that the municipality is authorized to perform and that the district is not engaged in performing nor authorized to perform.

    Sec. 43.074.  ABOLITION OF WATER-RELATED SPECIAL DISTRICT CREATED WHOLLY IN MUNICIPALITY.  (a)  A water control and improvement district, fresh water supply district, or municipal utility district created from area that, at the time of the district's creation, is located wholly in a municipality may be abolished as provided by this section.
    
    (b)  On a vote of at least two-thirds of the entire membership of the governing body of the municipality, the governing body may adopt an ordinance abolishing the district if the governing body finds:
    
    (1)  that:
    
    (A)  the district is no longer needed;  or
    
    (B)  the services furnished and functions performed by the district can be furnished and performed by the municipality;  and
    
    (2)  that the abolition of the district is in the best interests of the residents and property in the municipality and the district.
    
    (c)  If before the effective date of the ordinance or if within 30 days after the effective date or the date of the publication of the ordinance, a petition that is signed and verified by a number of qualified voters of the municipality equal to at least 10 percent of the total votes cast at the most recent election for municipal officers is filed with the secretary of the municipality protesting the enactment or enforcement of the ordinance, the ordinance is suspended and any action taken under the ordinance is void.  Immediately after the filing of the petition, the secretary shall present it to the governing body.  Immediately after the presentation of the petition, the governing body shall reconsider the ordinance.  If the governing body does not repeal the ordinance, the governing body shall submit it to a popular vote at the next municipal election or at a special election the governing body may order for that purpose.  The ordinance does not take effect unless a majority of the votes received in the election favor the ordinance.
    
    (d)  On the adoption of the ordinance, the district is abolished, the property and other assets of the district vest in the municipality, and the municipality assumes and becomes liable for the bonds and other obligations of the district.  The municipality shall perform the services and other functions that were performed by the district.
    
    (e)  If a district bond, warrant, or other obligation payable in whole or in part from property taxes is assumed by the municipality, the governing body shall levy and collect taxes on all taxable property in the municipality in an amount sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the bond, warrant, or other obligation as it becomes due and payable.
    
    (f)  The municipality may issue refunding bonds in its own name to refund bonds, warrants, or other obligations, including unpaid accrued interest on an obligation, that is assumed by the municipality.  The refunding bonds must be issued in the manner provided by Chapter [1207](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=1207), Government Code.

    Sec. 43.075.  ABOLITION OF, OR DIVISION OF FUNCTIONS OF, WATER-RELATED SPECIAL DISTRICT THAT BECOMES PART OF NOT MORE THAN ONE MUNICIPALITY.  (a)  This section applies to:
    
    (1)  a municipality that annexes all or part of the area in a water control and improvement district, fresh water supply district, or municipal utility district organized for the primary purpose of providing municipal functions such as the supplying of fresh water for domestic or commercial uses or the furnishing of sanitary sewer service or drainage service;  or
    
    (2)  a municipality:
    
    (A)  that, by incorporation of the municipality, includes in the municipality all or part of the area in a district described by Subdivision (1);  and
    
    (B)  the governing body of which adopts, by a vote of at least two-thirds of its entire membership, an ordinance making this section applicable to the municipality.
    
    (b)  This section does not apply if the district includes area located in more than one municipality.
    
    (c)  The municipality succeeds to the powers, duties, assets, and obligations of the district as provided by this section.  This section does not prohibit the municipality from continuing to operate utility facilities in the district that are owned and operated by the municipality on the date the area becomes a part of the municipality.
    
    (d)  If all the area in the district becomes a part of the municipality, the municipality:
    
    (1)  shall take over all the property and other assets of the district;
    
    (2)  assumes all the debts, liabilities, and obligations of the district;  and
    
    (3)  shall perform all the functions of the district, including the provision of services.
    
    (e)  The governing body of the municipality by ordinance shall designate the date on which the duties and the assumption under Subsection (d) take effect.  The date must be set for a day within 90 days after the date the area becomes a part of the municipality.  If the governing body fails to adopt the ordinance, the duties and the assumption automatically take effect on the 91st day after the date the area becomes a part of the municipality.  The district is abolished on the date the duties and assumption take effect.
    
    (f)  If only part of the area in the district becomes a part of the municipality, the governing bodies of the municipality and the district may make contracts relating to the division and allocation between themselves of their duplicate and overlapping powers, duties, and other functions and relating to the use, management, control, purchase, conveyance, assumption, and disposition of the property and other assets, debts, liabilities, and obligations of the district.
    
    (g)  If only part of the area in the district becomes a part of the municipality, the district may contract with the municipality for the municipal operation of the district's utility systems and other property and for the transfer, conveyance, or sale of those systems and that property, regardless of kind or location inside or outside municipal boundaries, to the municipality on terms to which the governing bodies of the district and municipality agree.  That operating contract may extend for a period, not to exceed 30 years, stipulated in the contract and is subject to amendment, renewal, or termination by the mutual consent of the governing bodies.  The contract may not impair the obligation of another contract of the municipality or district.  In the absence of such a contract, the district may continue to exercise the powers and other functions that it was authorized to exercise before the area became a part of the municipality, and the municipality may not, without the district's consent, duplicate the services rendered by the district in the district.  However, the municipality may perform in the district all other municipal functions in which the district is not engaged.
    
    (h)  If a district bond, warrant, or other obligation payable in whole or in part from property taxes is assumed under this section by the municipality, the governing body shall levy and collect taxes on all taxable property in the municipality in an amount sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the bond, warrant, or other obligation as it becomes due and payable.  The municipality may issue refunding bonds or warrants to refund bonds, warrants, or other obligations, including unpaid earned interest on them, that is assumed by the municipality.  The refunding bonds or warrants must be issued in the manner provided by Chapter [1207](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=1207), Government Code. A refunding bond must bear interest at the same rate or at a lower rate than that borne by the refunded obligation unless it is shown mathematically that a different rate results in a savings in the total amount of interest to be paid.
    
    (i)  If all the area in the district becomes a part of the municipality and if the district has outstanding bonds, warrants, or other obligations payable solely from the net revenues from the operation of any utility system or property, the municipality shall take over and operate the system or property and shall apply the net revenues from the operation to the payment of the outstanding revenue bonds, warrants, or other obligations as if the district had not been abolished.  The municipality may combine the district system or property with the municipality's similar system or property if:
    
    (1)  the municipality has no outstanding revenue bonds, warrants, or other obligations payable from and secured by a pledge of the net revenue of its own utility system or property;  or
    
    (2)  the municipality:
    
    (A)  has outstanding obligations payable from and secured by a pledge of net revenues sufficient to meet the outstanding obligations;  and
    
    (B)  those revenues have produced, during the five-year period before May 30, 1959, an annual surplus in an amount sufficient to meet the annual obligations for which the district revenues are pledged.
    
    (j)  If the municipality combines the systems or property as provided by Subsection (i), it shall levy on all property subject to taxation by the municipality an annual property tax at a rate that, when combined with other available municipal funds and revenues, is sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the outstanding obligations.
    
    (k)  If all the area in the district becomes a part of the municipality, the municipality, unless the refunding authorized by Subsection (l) has been accomplished, shall separately operate the district and municipal systems and property and may not commingle revenue if the municipality has outstanding bonds, warrants, or other bonded obligations payable from and secured by a pledge of the net revenue of its own utility system or property and does not have an amount annually accruing to its surplus revenue fund that exceeds the amount of the fund pledged to the payment of outstanding municipal obligations and that is sufficient to meet the annual obligations for which the district revenues are pledged.  The municipality shall perform the duties and other functions imposed by law or contract on the governing body of the district relating to the district's outstanding bonds, warrants, or other obligations and shall separately perform the duties and other functions relating to the bonds, warrants, and other obligations of the municipal system.  The municipality may allocate overhead expenses between any two or more systems in direct proportion to the gross income of each system.
    
    (l)  The municipality may issue revenue refunding bonds in its own name for the purpose of refunding outstanding district revenue bonds, warrants, or other obligations, including unpaid accrued interest on them, that are assumed by the municipality under this section.  The municipality may combine different issues of district and municipal revenue bonds, warrants, or other obligations into one series of revenue refunding bonds and may pledge the net revenues of the utility systems or property to the payment of the refunding bonds as the governing body considers proper.  Except as otherwise provided by this section, Chapter [1502](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=1502), Government Code, applies to the revenue refunding bonds, but an election for the issuance of the bonds is not required.  Refunding bonds must bear interest at the same rate or at a lower rate than that borne by the refunded obligations unless it is shown mathematically that a different rate results in a savings in the total amount of interest to be paid.

    (o)  This section is cumulative of all other authority to make, enter into, and perform a regional participation agreement.  In case of any conflict or ambiguity between this section and any other law or municipal charter provision, this section shall prevail and control.
    
    (p)  This section shall be liberally construed so as to give effect to its legislative purposes and to sustain the validity of a regional participation agreement if the agreement was entered into under or in anticipation of enactment of this section.

(a)  This section applies to a municipality that contains, as a result of the annexation by or the incorporation of the municipality, any part of the area in a water control and improvement district, fresh water supply district, or municipal utility district organized for the primary purpose of providing municipal functions such as the supplying of fresh water for domestic or commercial uses or the furnishing of sanitary sewer service, if:
    
    (1)  the balance of the area in the district is located in one or more other municipalities;  
    
    (2)  the district is not created by a special act of the legislature and the balance of the area is located in one or more other municipalities and in an unincorporated area;  or
    
    (3)  the district is a conservation and reclamation district of more than 10,000 acres which provides water and sanitary sewer service to households and parts of which are located in two or more municipalities, one of which has a population of more than 1.6 million.
    
    (b)  The municipality succeeds to the powers, duties, assets, and obligations of the district as provided by this section.  This section does not prohibit the municipality from continuing to operate utility facilities in the district that are owned and operated by the municipality on the date the part of the district area becomes a part of the municipality.
    
    (c)  If the district is located wholly in two or more municipalities, the district may be abolished by agreement among the district and the municipalities in which the district is located.  Subject to Subsection (f), the agreement must provide for the distribution among the municipalities of the property and other assets of the district and for the pro rata assumption by the municipalities of all the debts, liabilities, and obligations of the district.  The assumption by each municipality must be based on the ratio that the value of the property and other assets distributed to that municipality bears to the total value of all the property and other assets of the district.  The determination of value may be made on an original cost basis, a reproduction cost basis, a fair market value basis, or by any other valuation method agreed on by the parties that reasonably reflects the value of the property and other assets, debts, liabilities, and obligations of the district.  The agreement must specify the date on which the district is abolished.
    
    (d)  If the district is located wholly in two or more municipalities and in unincorporated area, the district may be abolished by agreement among the district and all of the municipalities in which parts of the district are located.  The abolition agreement must provide for the distribution of assets and liabilities as provided by Subsection (c).  The agreement must also provide for the distribution among one or more of the municipalities of the pro rata assets and liabilities located in the unincorporated area and must provide for service to customers in unincorporated areas in the service area of the abolished district.  The municipality that provides the service in the unincorporated area may charge its usual and customary fees and assessments to the customers in that area.
    
    (e)  An agreement made under Subsection (c) or (d) must be approved by an ordinance adopted by the governing body of each municipality and by an order or resolution adopted by the governing board of the district before the date specified in the agreement for the abolition, distribution, and assumption.
    
    (f)  If the abolished district has outstanding bonds, warrants, or other obligations payable in whole or in part from the net revenue from the operation of the district utility system or property, the affected municipalities shall take over and operate the system or property through a board of trustees as provided by this section.  The municipalities shall apply the net revenue from the operation of the system or property to the payment of outstanding revenue bonds, warrants, or other obligations as if the district had not been abolished.  The system or property shall be operated in that manner until all the revenue bonds, warrants, or obligations are retired in full by payment or by the refunding of the bonds, warrants, or other obligations into municipal obligations.  The board of trustees must be composed of not more than five members appointed by the governing bodies of the municipalities.  The trustees are appointed for the terms and shall perform the duties as provided by the agreement made under Subsection (c) or (d).  The board also shall perform the duties and other functions that are imposed by law or by contract on the abolished district and its governing board and that relate to the outstanding revenue bonds.  The board shall charge and collect sufficient rates for the services of the system or property and shall apply the revenue to comply with each covenant or agreement contained in the proceedings relating to the revenue bonds, warrants, or other obligations with respect to the payment of principal and interest and the maintenance of reserves and other funds.  When all the revenue bonds, warrants, and other obligations are retired in full, the property and other assets of the district shall be distributed among the municipalities as provided by Subsection (c) or (d).  On the distribution, the board is abolished.
    
    (g)  When the pro rata share of any district bonds, warrants, or other obligations payable in whole or in part from property taxes has been assumed by the municipality, the governing body of the municipality shall levy and collect taxes on all taxable property in the municipality to pay the principal of and interest on its share as the principal and interest become due and payable.
    
    (h)  The municipality may issue general obligation refunding bonds in its own name to refund in whole or in part its pro rata share of any outstanding district bonds, warrants, or other obligations, including unpaid earned interest on them, that are assumed by the municipality and that are payable in whole or in part from property taxes.  The refunding bonds must be issued in the manner provided by Chapter [1207](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=1207), Government Code. Refunding bonds must bear interest at the same rate or at a lower rate than that borne by the refunded obligations unless it is shown mathematically that a different rate results in a savings in the total amount of interest to be paid.
    
    (i)  The municipality may issue revenue refunding bonds or general obligation refunding bonds in its own name to refund in whole or in part its pro rata share of any outstanding district bonds, warrants, or other obligations, including unpaid earned interest on them, that are assumed by the municipality and that are payable solely from net revenues.  The municipality may combine the different issues or the bonds of different issues of both district and municipal revenue bonds, warrants, or other obligations into one or more series of revenue refunding bonds.  The municipality may pledge the net revenues of the district utility system or property to the payment of those bonds, warrants, or other obligations.  The municipality may also combine the different issues or the bonds of the different issues into one or more series of general obligation refunding bonds.  An originally issued municipal revenue bond may not be refunded into municipal general obligation refunding bonds.  Except as otherwise provided by this section, Subchapter [B](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=1502.051), Chapter [1502](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=1502), Government Code, applies to the revenue refunding bonds, but an election for the issuance of the bonds is not required.

    Sec. 43.125.  ADOPTION OF REGULATORY PLAN.  (a)  At the time the governing body of the municipality adopts an ordinance annexing an area for limited purposes, the governing body must also adopt by ordinance a regulatory plan for the area.

This requirement may be waived and the date for full-purpose annexation postponed by written agreement between the municipality and a majority of the affected landowners.  A written agreement to waive the municipality's obligation to annex the area for full purposes binds all future owners of land annexed for limited purposes pursuant to that waiver.

By the end of the second year after that date, the municipality must include the area in the municipality's long-range financial forecast and in the municipality's program to identify future capital improvements projects.  By the end of the third year after that date, the municipality must include in its adopted capital improvements program the projects intended to serve the area and must identify potential sources of funding for capital improvements.

    Sec. 43.136.  AUTHORITY OF SPECIAL-LAW MUNICIPALITY TO ANNEX FOR LIMITED PURPOSES ALONG NAVIGABLE STREAM.  (a)  The governing body of a special-law municipality located along or on a navigable stream may extend the boundaries of the municipality to include the area designated by Subsection (b) only to:
    
    (1)  improve navigation on the stream by the United States, the municipality, or a navigation or other improvement district; and
    
    (2)  establish and maintain wharves, docks, railway terminals, side tracks, warehouses, or other facilities or aids relating to navigation or wharves.
    
    (b)  The municipality by ordinance may extend the boundaries to include an area composed of the navigable stream and the land on each side of the stream.  The area may not exceed 2,500 feet in width on either side of the stream as measured from the thread of the stream and may not exceed 20 miles in length as measured in a direct line from the ordinary municipal boundaries, either above or below the boundaries, or both.  Consequently, the area subject to the boundary extension is a strip 5,000 feet wide and 20 miles in length, or as much of that strip as the governing body considers advisable to add to the municipality.  The boundaries are extended on the adoption of the ordinance.

    (e)  A municipality may not tax the property over which the boundaries are extended under this section unless the property is within the general municipal boundaries.
    
    (f)  After the adoption of the ordinance extending the municipal boundaries, the municipality may fully regulate navigation, wharfage, including wharfage rates, and all facilities, conveniences, and aids to navigation or wharfage.  The municipality may adopt ordinances, including those imposing criminal penalties, and may otherwise police navigation on the stream and the use of the wharves or other facilities and aids to navigation or wharfage.
    
    (g)  The municipality may designate all or part of the added area as an industrial district, as the term is customarily used, and may treat the designated area in a manner considered by the governing body to be in the best interest of the municipality.  The governing body may make written contracts or agreements with the owners of land in the industrial district, to guarantee the continuation of the limited purpose annexation status of the district and its immunity from general purpose annexation for a period not to exceed 10 years.  The contract or agreement may contain other terms considered appropriate by the parties.  The governing body and landowners may renew or extend the contract for successive periods not to exceed 10 years each.
    
    (h)  Notwithstanding any other law, including a municipal ordinance or charter provision, the governing body by ordinance may change the status of an area previously annexed for general purposes to limited purpose annexation status governed by this section if:

The governing body shall continue to levy a property tax each year on the property in the area at the same rate that is levied on other property in the municipality until the taxes collected from the area equal its pro rata share of the indebtedness.  Those taxes may be charged only with the cost of levying and collecting the taxes, and the taxes shall be applied exclusively to the payment of the pro rata share of the indebtedness.  This subsection does not prevent the inhabitants of the area from paying in full at any time their pro rata share of the indebtedness.
