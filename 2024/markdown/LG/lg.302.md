    Sec. 302.004.  METHOD OF FINANCING; TERMS OF CONTRACT.  (a)  An energy savings performance contract may be financed:
    
    (1)  under a lease-purchase contract that has a term not to exceed 20 years from the final date of installation and that meets federal tax requirements for tax-free municipal leasing or long-term financing;
    
    (2)  with the proceeds of bonds; or
    
    (3)  under a contract with the provider of the energy or water conservation or usage measures that has a term not to exceed the lesser of 20 years from the final date of installation or the average useful life of the energy or water conservation or usage measures.
    
    (a-1)  Notwithstanding other law, the governing body of a local government may use any available money to pay the provider of the energy or water conservation measures under this section, and the governing body is not required to pay for such costs solely out of the savings realized by the local government under an energy savings performance contract.  The governing body may contract with the provider to perform work that is related to, connected with, or otherwise ancillary to the measures identified in the scope of an energy savings performance contract.
    
    (b)  An energy savings performance contract shall contain provisions requiring the provider of the energy or water conservation or usage measures to provide a guarantee.  If the term of the contract exceeds one year, the local government's contractual obligations in any one year during the term of the contract beginning after the final date of installation may not exceed the total energy and water savings, the net operating cost savings, and the stipulated or agreed upon increase in billable revenues resulting from the estimated increase in meter accuracy, divided by the number of years in the contract term.

Notice of the request for qualifications shall be published in the manner provided for competitive bidding.
    
    (b)  Before entering into an energy savings performance contract, the governing body must require that the energy savings, increase in billable revenues, or increase in meter accuracy estimated or projected by a provider be reviewed by a licensed professional engineer who:
    
    (1)  has a minimum of three years of experience in energy calculation and review;
    
    (2)  is not an officer or employee of a provider for the contract under review; and
    
    (3)  is not otherwise associated with the contract.
    
    (c)  In conducting the review, the engineer shall focus primarily on the proposed improvements from an engineering perspective, the methodology and calculations related to cost savings, increases in revenue, and, if applicable, efficiency or accuracy of metering equipment.  An engineer who reviews a contract shall maintain the confidentiality of any proprietary information the engineer acquires while reviewing the contract.  Sections [1001.053](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=1001.053) and [1001.407](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=1001.407), Occupations Code, apply to work performed under the contract.

    (1)  to perform work that is not related to, connected with, or otherwise ancillary to the measures identified in the original scope of an energy savings performance contract; or
    
    (2)  in a way that increases the price of the original awarded contract by more than 25 percent of the original contract value.
    
    (e)  Subsection (d) applies only to the design or construction of a water supply project, water plant, wastewater plant, water and wastewater distribution or conveyance facility, or drainage project.

    Sec. 302.006.  METER GUARANTEES.  (a)  This section applies to any energy savings performance contract that:
    
    (1)  provides for any metering or related equipment, system, or process or procedure; and
    
    (2)  includes a meter guarantee by the provider, regardless of whether the meter guarantee is a part of a broader guarantee applicable to other energy or water conservation or usage measures or causally connected work.
    
    (b)  Not later than the fifth anniversary of the effective date of an energy savings performance contract, an engineer shall test a statistically relevant sample of the meters installed or implemented under the contract to determine or calculate the actual average accuracy and shall compare the actual average accuracy to the baseline average accuracy of those tested meters.
    
    (c)  A meter guarantee applies if the engineer reports to the local government and the provider that the average accuracy of the tested meters as of the testing date is less than the baseline average accuracy of the tested meters as of the testing date.
    
    (d)  The amount payable under the meter guarantee must be determined for each year subject to the engineer's report and is equal to the difference between:
    
    (1)  the agreed increase in billable revenues based on the estimated accuracy of all of the meters for each year, according to the energy savings performance contract; and
    
    (2)  the revenues for the same year that would result from applying the engineer's reported actual average accuracy of the tested meters to all of the meters subject to the energy savings performance contract, using the same contract components that were used to calculate the agreed increase in billable revenues for that year, assuming the annual decrease in actual average accuracy of all the meters was a pro rata percentage of the reported total decrease in actual average accuracy.
    
    (e)  Notwithstanding Subsection (d), if the meter guarantee in the contract is part of a broader guarantee applicable to other energy or water conservation or usage measures or causally connected work under the contract, the amount payable under the meter guarantee for any year during the measurement period is reduced or offset by the difference between:
    
    (1)  the sum of the energy savings and the increase in billable revenues resulting from the other energy or water conservation or usage measures or causally connected work for that year during the measurement period; and
    
    (2)  the guaranteed amount of the energy savings and the increase in billable revenues from the other energy or water conservation or usage measures or causally connected work for that year during the measurement period.
    
    (f)  A test conducted under this section must be performed in accordance with the procedures established by the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol or succeeding standards of the United States Department of Energy.
    
    (g)  An engineer conducting a test under this section shall:
    
    (1)  verify that the tested meters have been properly maintained and are operating properly; and
    
    (2)  comply with Section [302.005](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=302.005)(c).
