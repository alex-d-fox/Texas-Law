    (b)  The commissioner shall examine the disputed matter at once.  From the information maintained in the General Land Office, the commissioner shall designate to the surveyors the line to be run, stating at what specific point the surveyors shall begin and to what specific point they shall run the line.  In the instructions to the surveyors, the commissioner shall adhere as closely as possible to the line designated in the law that created the county line.  The instructions from the commissioner constitute authority for the surveyors to run that line.  After the survey based on the commissioner's instructions, that line is the true boundary between the counties.

    Sec. 72.009.  SUIT TO ESTABLISH BOUNDARIES.  (a)  A county may bring suit against an adjacent county to establish the common boundary line.  The suit must be brought in the district court of a county in an adjoining judicial district whose boundaries are not affected by the suit and whose county seat is closest to the county seat of the county that brings the suit.  The court shall try the suit in the same manner in which it tries other suits.
    
    (b)  The district court has jurisdiction to determine where the boundary line is located and may order the line to be re-marked and resurveyed.  The line established by the district court shall be treated as the true boundary between the counties unless the court determines that the line in question was established under prior law.  If the district court determines that the boundary line has been established under prior law, the court shall declare that line to be the true boundary between the counties and shall have that line resurveyed and established as the boundary.
    
    (c)  The commissioner of the General Land Office may not mark a contested county line on the maps maintained by the land office until a certified copy of the final judgment is filed in the land office with a certified copy of the field notes of the boundary line established by the judgment.
    
    (d)  The remedy provided by this section is in addition to any other remedy prescribed by this chapter.

    (3)  a taxing unit other than a county that has territory in a county described by Subdivision (1) or (2).
    
    (c)  If, as a result of disputed, overlapping, or erroneously applied geographic boundaries between like taxing units, multiple like taxing units have imposed ad valorem taxes on the same property, the property owner may file suit in the supreme court to:
    
    (1)  establish the correct geographic boundary between the taxing units; and
    
    (2)  determine the amount of taxes owed on the property and the taxing unit or units to which the taxes are owed.
    
    (d)  The supreme court has original jurisdiction to hear and determine a suit filed under Subsection (c) and may issue injunctive or declaratory relief in connection with the suit.
    
    (e)  The supreme court shall enter a final order determining a suit filed under Subsection (c) not later than the 90th day after the date the suit is filed.
