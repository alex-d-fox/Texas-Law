    (b)  A regional military sustainability commission shall establish an advisory committee and appoint six members to the committee.  Three of the members appointed to the committee must represent the military installation for which the commission is established and three members must represent landowners in the area surrounding the military installation.  The committee shall advise the commission on protecting the critical military missions of the military installation with regard to development.
    
    (c)  On receipt of an application for a permit for a new project in the commission's territory, the governing body of the participating governmental entity shall review the application and request a report from the commission regarding the proposed project.  The commission, with the advice of the advisory committee, shall review the compatibility of the new project with the military installation's military missions and related operations based on the commission's compatible development standards.  The commission shall submit a report of its findings, including a recommendation regarding compatibility, to the reviewing governmental entity not later than the 15th calendar day after the date the request was made.  The report must include an estimate of the fiscal impact on the affected property of any recommendations submitted by the commission as part of the report.
    
    (d)  The reviewing governmental entity may not take action on the permit application until it receives the report of the commission.  If the commission finds that the proposed new project is not compatible with the military installation's missions and recommends denial of the permit application, the reviewing governmental entity may disapprove the permit application.
    
    (e)  On annexation of an area in the commission's territory for full or limited purposes by a municipality, the area is removed from the commission's territory.  If the municipality disannexes the area, the area is included in the commission's territory.
