    Sec. 320.075.  APPROVAL AND REGISTRATION.  (a)  After any bonds have been authorized by the commissioners court, the bonds and the records relating to their issuance shall be submitted to the attorney general for examination and approval.  The attorney general shall approve the bonds if issued in accordance with this subchapter.
    
    (b)  After the bonds have been approved by the attorney general, they shall be registered by the comptroller of public accounts.

    Sec. 320.076.  FEES AND REVENUE.  (a)  In this section, "fee" includes any fee, charge, or toll.
    
    (b)  The necessary and reasonable expenses of operation and maintenance of the properties and facilities whose revenues are pledged to the payment of the revenue bonds are a first lien on and charge against the income of the properties and facilities.  While any of the bonds or interest remains outstanding, the board shall charge and require the payment of fees for the use of the properties and facilities.  The board shall determine the rates of fees charged by it for the use, operation, or lease of the properties and facilities.  Fees must be equal and uniform within classes and must be in amounts that yield revenues at all times at least sufficient to pay the expenses of operation and maintenance, and to provide for the payments prescribed in the bond order for the establishment and maintenance of the funds provided for in the bond order, including the interest and sinking fund and each reserve fund.  The bond order may make additional covenants with respect to the bonds and the pledged revenues and the operation, maintenance, and upkeep of those properties and facilities, the income of which is pledged.
    
    (c)  The commissioners court shall ensure that the fees charged by the board are sufficient to comply with this subchapter.  If for any reason the fees are not sufficient, the commissioners court shall impose additional fees so that the revenue will be sufficient.
    
    (d)  If any part of the security for the bonds consists of money to be received by the board as consideration for properties or facilities belonging to the county but operated by a person other than the board under a lease or operating contract, the board shall fix and authorize fees to be charged by the person for services rendered by the properties or facilities.  The fees must be in amounts at least sufficient to assure receipt by the board of money that the board is committed to pay from that source for the benefit of the revenue bonds under the bond order.

    Sec. 320.077.  REFUNDING BONDS.  (a)  The commissioners court may issue fully negotiable revenue bonds for the purpose of refunding bonds issued under this subchapter.  An election is not necessary for the issuance of refunding bonds.
    
    (b)  The refunding bonds may be secured in the manner provided by this subchapter for securing original revenue bonds.
    
    (c)  Refunding bonds may be issued to refund bonds of more than one series or issue of outstanding revenue bonds and may combine pledges for the outstanding bonds for the security of the refunding bonds.  Refunding bonds may be secured by other and additional revenues if the refunding bonds will not impair the contract rights of the holders or any of the outstanding bonds that are not to be refunded.
    
    (d)  Refunding bonds must be authorized by order of the commissioners court and shall be executed and mature as provided by this subchapter for original bonds.
    
    (e)  Refunding bonds must bear interest at the same or lower rate than that of the bonds refunded unless it is shown mathematically that a saving will result in the total amount of interest to be paid.
    
    (f)  Refunding bonds shall be approved by the attorney general as in the case of original bonds and shall be registered by the comptroller of public accounts on surrender and cancellation of the bonds to be refunded, unless the order authorizing issuance provides that the bonds are to be sold and the proceeds deposited in the place or places where the original bonds are payable.  In that case, the refunding bonds may be issued in an amount sufficient to pay the interest on the original bonds to their option or maturity date, and the comptroller shall register them without the surrender and cancellation of the original bonds.
    
    (g)  Refunding bonds, after they have been approved by the attorney general and registered by the comptroller, are incontestable.

    Sec. 320.078.  BONDS NOT STATE OR COUNTY DEBT.  (a)  The revenue bonds are not a debt of the county or of the state but are payable solely from the revenues pledged to their payment.
    
    (b)  The principal of or interest on revenue bonds or any refunding bonds is not a debt against the tax revenues of the county but is solely a charge on the pledged revenues.
    
    (c)  The revenue bonds or refunding bonds may not be considered in determining the power of the county to incur obligations payable from taxation.
    
    (d)  Each bond must contain on its face substantially the following provision:  "The holder hereof shall never have the right to demand payment of his obligation out of any funds raised or to be raised by taxation."

    Sec. 320.079.  MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.  (a)  This section applies to revenue bonds and refunding bonds issued under this subchapter.
    
    (b)  The bond order may require that the bonds contain a recital to the effect that they are issued pursuant to and in strict conformity with this subchapter.  That recital is conclusive evidence of the validity of the bonds and the regularity of their issuance.
    
    (c)  Each bond is exempt from taxation by this state or by a municipal corporation, county, or other political subdivision or taxing district or entity of the state.
    
    (d)  If provided for in the bond order, an indenture securing the bonds may be entered into between, and executed by, the county and a corporate trustee, or entered into between, and executed by, the county and a corporate trustee and a corporate or individual cotrustee.  A corporate trustee or corporate cotrustee must be a trust company or bank in or outside this state that has the powers of a trust company.
    
    (e)  The bond order or any indenture may:
    
    (1)  contain provisions for protecting or enforcing the rights or remedies of the bondholders as the commissioners court considers reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the county and the board in reference to maintenance, operation, repair, and insurance (including insurance against loss of use and occupancy) of the properties or facilities whose revenues are pledged, and the custody, safeguarding, and application of the bond proceeds and of the revenues to be received from the operation of the properties or facilities;
    
    (2)  provide for the flow of funds and the establishment and maintenance of the interest and sinking fund, reserve fund or funds, and other funds;  and
    
    (3)  include additional covenants with respect to the bonds and the pledged revenues and the operation, maintenance, and upkeep of those properties and facilities the income of which is pledged, as the commissioners court considers appropriate.
    
    (f)  Any bank or trust company in this state may act as depository for the proceeds obtained from the sale of the bonds.  The depository shall be selected by the commissioners court without the necessity of seeking competitive bids and without reference to any other statute.  The money deposited must be secured in the manner and amount as prescribed by the commissioners court or by the bond order, indenture, or separate escrow agreement.
    
    (g)  The bond order shall provide for and designate the depository or depositories of the interest and sinking fund, reserve fund or funds, and any other funds established by the order.  The depository or depositories may be any bank or trust company in or outside this state and may be selected and designated without the necessity of seeking competitive bids and without reference to any other statute.  The money in those funds must be secured in the manner and to the extent as provided in the bond order, and the bond order may require that the money be secured by direct obligations of the United States or obligations unconditionally guaranteed by the United States.
    
    (h)  The bond order or indenture may:
    
    (1)  set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may, subject to Subsection (i), restrict the individual rights of action of the bondholders;  and
    
    (2)  set forth and contain other provisions and covenants as considered reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders, including:
    
    (A)  provisions prescribing occurrences that constitute events of default and the terms and conditions on which any or all of the bonds become due, or may be declared to be due, before maturity;  and
    
    (B)  provisions as to the rights, liabilities, powers, and duties arising from the breach by the board or by the commissioners court of any of its duties or obligations.
    
    (i)  Any holders of the bonds or of interest coupons originally attached to the bonds may either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceeding, enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this subchapter to be performed by the board or by the commissioners court, including:
    
    (1)  the making and collection of reasonable and sufficient fees, charges, and tolls for the use of the properties and facilities the income of which is pledged;
    
    (2)  the segregation of the income and revenues of such properties and facilities;  and
    
    (3)  the application of the income and revenues pursuant to the bond order, indenture, and this subchapter.
    
    (j)  The bond order or the indenture may contain provisions to the effect that while any bonds are outstanding either as to principal or interest, no free service may be rendered by any of the properties or facilities the income of which is pledged.
    
    (k)  The bonds are negotiable instruments under Chapter [3](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=3), Business & Commerce Code, and are legal and authorized investments for banks, savings banks, trust companies, savings and loan associations, insurance companies, fiduciaries, trustees, guardians, and for the sinking funds of municipalities, counties, school districts, and other political subdivisions or corporations of this state.  The bonds are eligible to secure the deposit of public funds of this state and of a municipality, county, school district, or other political subdivision or corporation of this state.  The bonds are lawful and sufficient security for those deposits to the extent of their face value when accompanied by all unmatured appurtenant coupons.
    
    (l)  The bond order, the indenture, and this subchapter constitute an irrevocable contract between the board and commissioners court and the holders of the bonds.
