    SUBCHAPTER A. DANGEROUS STRUCTURES
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 214.001.  AUTHORITY REGARDING SUBSTANDARD BUILDING.  (a)  A municipality may, by ordinance, require the vacation, relocation of occupants, securing, repair, removal, or demolition of a building that is:
    
    (1)  dilapidated, substandard, or unfit for human habitation and a hazard to the public health, safety, and welfare;
    
    (2)  regardless of its structural condition, unoccupied by its owners, lessees, or other invitees and is unsecured from unauthorized entry to the extent that it could be entered or used by vagrants or other uninvited persons as a place of harborage or could be entered or used by children;  or
    
    (3)  boarded up, fenced, or otherwise secured in any manner if:
    
    (A)  the building constitutes a danger to the public even though secured from entry;  or
    
    (B)  the means used to secure the building are inadequate to prevent unauthorized entry or use of the building in the manner described by Subdivision (2).
    
    (b)  The ordinance must:
    
    (1)  establish minimum standards for the continued use and occupancy of all buildings regardless of the date of their construction;
    
    (2)  provide for giving proper notice, subject to Subsection (b-1), to the owner of a building;  and
    
    (3)  provide for a public hearing to determine whether a building complies with the standards set out in the ordinance.
    
    (b-1)  For a condominium, as defined by Section [81.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=81.002) or [82.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=82.003), Property Code, located wholly or partly in a municipality with a population of more than 1.9 million, notice to a unit owner in accordance with Section [82.118](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=82.118), Property Code, and notice to the registered agent for the unit owners' association in the manner provided for service of process to a condominium association under Section [54.035](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=54.035)(a-1) satisfy the notice requirements under this section.
    
    (c)  A notice of a hearing sent to an owner, lienholder, or mortgagee under this section must include a statement that the owner, lienholder, or mortgagee will be required to submit at the hearing proof of the scope of any work that may be required to comply with the ordinance and the time it will take to reasonably perform the work.
    
    (d)  After the public hearing, if a building is found in violation of standards set out in the ordinance, the municipality may order that the building be vacated, secured, repaired, removed, or demolished by the owner within a reasonable time as provided by this section.  The municipality also may order that the occupants be relocated within a reasonable time.  If the owner does not take the ordered action within the allotted time, the municipality shall make a diligent effort to discover each mortgagee and lienholder having an interest in the building or in the property on which the building is located.  The municipality shall personally deliver, send by certified mail with return receipt requested, or deliver by the United States Postal Service using signature confirmation service, to each identified mortgagee and lienholder a notice containing:
    
    (1)  an identification, which is not required to be a legal description, of the building and the property on which it is located;
    
    (2)  a description of the violation of municipal standards that is present at the building; and
    
    (3)  a statement that the municipality will vacate, secure, remove, or demolish the building or relocate the occupants of the building if the ordered action is not taken within a reasonable time.
    
    (e)  As an alternative to the procedure prescribed by Subsection (d), the municipality may make a diligent effort to discover each mortgagee and lienholder before conducting the public hearing and may give them a notice of and an opportunity to comment at the hearing.  In addition, the municipality may file notice of the hearing in the Official Public Records of Real Property in the county in which the property is located.  The notice must contain the name and address of the owner of the affected property if that information can be determined, a legal description of the affected property, and a description of the hearing.  The filing of the notice is binding on subsequent grantees, lienholders, or other transferees of an interest in the property who acquire such interest after the filing of the notice, and constitutes notice of the hearing on any subsequent recipient of any interest in the property who acquires such interest after the filing of the notice.  If the municipality operates under this subsection, the order issued by the municipality may specify a reasonable time as provided by this section for the building to be vacated, secured, repaired, removed, or demolished by the owner or for the occupants to be relocated by the owner and an additional reasonable time as provided by this section for the ordered action to be taken by any of the mortgagees or lienholders in the event the owner fails to comply with the order within the time provided for action by the owner.  Under this subsection, the municipality is not required to furnish any notice to a mortgagee or lienholder other than a copy of the order in the event the owner fails to timely take the ordered action.
    
    (f)  Within 10 days after the date that the order is issued, the municipality shall:
    
    (1)  file a copy of the order in the office of the municipal secretary or clerk, if the municipality has a population of 1.9 million or less;  and
    
    (2)  publish in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality in which the building is located a notice containing:
    
    (A)  the street address or legal description of the property;
    
    (B)  the date of the hearing;
    
    (C)  a brief statement indicating the results of the order;  and
    
    (D)  instructions stating where a complete copy of the order may be obtained.
    
    (g)  After the hearing, the municipality shall promptly mail by certified mail with return receipt requested, deliver by the United States Postal Service using signature confirmation service, or personally deliver a copy of the order to the owner of the building and to any lienholder or mortgagee of the building.  The municipality shall use its best efforts to determine the identity and address of any owner, lienholder, or mortgagee of the building.
    
    (h)  In conducting a hearing authorized under this section, the municipality shall require the owner, lienholder, or mortgagee of the building to within 30 days:
    
    (1)  secure the building from unauthorized entry;  or
    
    (2)  repair, remove, or demolish the building, unless the owner or lienholder establishes at the hearing that the work cannot reasonably be performed within 30 days.
    
    (i)  If the municipality allows the owner, lienholder, or mortgagee more than 30 days to repair, remove, or demolish the building, the municipality shall establish specific time schedules for the commencement and performance of the work and shall require the owner, lienholder, or mortgagee to secure the property in a reasonable manner from unauthorized entry while the work is being performed, as determined by the hearing official.
    
    (j)  A municipality may not allow the owner, lienholder, or mortgagee more than 90 days to repair, remove, or demolish the building or fully perform all work required to comply with the order unless the owner, lienholder, or mortgagee:
    
    (1)  submits a detailed plan and time schedule for the work at the hearing;  and
    
    (2)  establishes at the hearing that the work cannot reasonably be completed within 90 days because of the scope and complexity of the work.
    
    (k)  If the municipality allows the owner, lienholder, or mortgagee more than 90 days to complete any part of the work required to repair, remove, or demolish the building, the municipality shall require the owner, lienholder, or mortgagee to regularly submit progress reports to the municipality to demonstrate compliance with the time schedules established for commencement and performance of the work.  The order may require that the owner, lienholder, or mortgagee appear before the hearing official or the hearing official's designee to demonstrate compliance with the time schedules.  If the owner, lienholder, or mortgagee owns property, including structures or improvements on property, within the municipal boundaries that exceeds $100,000 in total value, the municipality may require the owner, lienholder, or mortgagee to post a cash or surety bond in an amount adequate to cover the cost of repairing, removing, or demolishing a building under this subsection.  In lieu of a bond, the municipality may require the owner, lienholder, or mortgagee to provide a letter of credit from a financial institution or a guaranty from a third party approved by the municipality.  The bond must be posted, or the letter of credit or third party guaranty provided, not later than the 30th day after the date the municipality issues the order.
    
    (l)  In a public hearing to determine whether a building complies with the standards set out in an ordinance adopted under this section, the owner, lienholder, or mortgagee has the burden of proof to demonstrate the scope of any work that may be required to comply with the ordinance and the time it will take to reasonably perform the work.
    
    (m)  If the building is not vacated, secured, repaired, removed, or demolished, or the occupants are not relocated within the allotted time, the municipality may vacate, secure, remove, or demolish the building or relocate the occupants at its own expense.  This subsection does not limit the ability of a municipality to collect on a bond or other financial guaranty that may be required by Subsection (k).
    
    (n)  If a municipality incurs expenses under Subsection (m), the municipality may assess the expenses on, and the municipality has a lien against, unless it is a homestead as protected by the Texas Constitution, the property on which the building was located.  The lien is extinguished if the property owner or another person having an interest in the legal title to the property reimburses the municipality for the expenses.  The lien arises and attaches to the property at the time the notice of the lien is recorded and indexed in the office of the county clerk in the county in which the property is located.  The notice must contain the name and address of the owner if that information can be determined with a reasonable effort, a legal description of the real property on which the building was located, the amount of expenses incurred by the municipality, and the balance due.
    
    (o)  If the notice is given and the opportunity to relocate the tenants of the building or to repair, remove, or demolish the building is afforded to each mortgagee and lienholder as authorized by Subsection (d), (e), or (g), the lien is a privileged lien subordinate only to tax liens.
    
    (p)  A hearing under this section may be held by a civil municipal court.
    
    (q)  A municipality satisfies the requirements of this section to make a diligent effort, to use its best efforts, or to make a reasonable effort to determine the identity and address of an owner, a lienholder, or a mortgagee if the municipality searches the following records:
    
    (1)  county real property records of the county in which the building is located;
    
    (2)  appraisal district records of the appraisal district in which the building is located;
    
    (3)  records of the secretary of state;
    
    (4)  assumed name records of the county in which the building is located;
    
    (5)  tax records of the municipality;  and
    
    (6)  utility records of the municipality.
    
    (r)  When a municipality mails a notice in accordance with this section to a property owner, lienholder, mortgagee, or registered agent and the United States Postal Service returns the notice as "refused" or "unclaimed," the validity of the notice is not affected, and the notice is considered delivered.
    
    (s)  A court shall expedite any proceeding, including an appeal in accordance with Section [214.0012](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=214.0012), related to a substandard building determination under this section by a municipality with a population of 500,000 or more.

    (b)  On the filing of the petition, the court may issue a writ of certiorari directed to the municipality to review the order of the municipality and shall prescribe in the writ the time within which a return on the writ must be made, which must be longer than 10 days, and served on the relator or the relator's attorney.
    
    (c)  The municipality may not be required to return the original papers acted on by it, but it is sufficient for the municipality to return certified or sworn copies of the papers or of parts of the papers as may be called for by the writ.

    (e)  The issuance of the writ does not stay proceedings on the decision appealed from.
    
    (f)  Appeal in the district court shall be limited to a hearing under the substantial evidence rule.  The court may reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, or may modify the decision brought up for review.

    (b)  In addition to the authority granted to the municipality by Section [214.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=214.001), after the expiration of the time allotted under Section [214.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=214.001)(d) or (e) for the repair, removal, or demolition of a building, the municipality may:
    
    (1)  repair the building at the expense of the municipality and assess the expenses on the land on which the building stands or to which it is attached and may provide for that assessment, the mode and manner of giving notice, and the means of recovering the repair expenses;  or
    
    (2)  assess a civil penalty against the property owner for failure to repair, remove, or demolish the building and provide for that assessment, the mode and manner of giving notice, and the means of recovering the assessment.
    
    (c)  The municipality may repair a building under Subsection (b) only to the extent necessary to bring the building into compliance with the minimum standards and only if the building is a residential building with 10 or fewer dwelling units.  The repairs may not improve the building to the extent that the building exceeds minimum housing standards.
    
    (d)  The municipality shall impose a lien against the land on which the building stands or stood, unless it is a homestead as protected by the Texas Constitution, to secure the payment of the repair, removal, or demolition expenses or the civil penalty.  Promptly after the imposition of the lien, the municipality must file for record, in recordable form in the office of the county clerk of the county in which the land is located, a written notice of the imposition of the lien.  The notice must contain a legal description of the land.
    
    (e)  Except as provided by Section [214.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=214.001), the municipality's lien to secure the payment of a civil penalty or the costs of repairs, removal, or demolition is inferior to any previously recorded bona fide mortgage lien attached to the real property to which the municipality's lien attaches if the mortgage lien was filed for record in the office of the county clerk of the county in which the real property is located before the date the civil penalty is assessed or the repair, removal, or demolition is begun by the municipality.  The municipality's lien is superior to all other previously recorded judgment liens.
    
    (f)  Any civil penalty or other assessment imposed under this section accrues interest at the rate of 10 percent a year from the date of the assessment until paid in full.
    
    (g)  The municipality's right to the assessment lien may not be transferred to third parties.
    
    (h)  In any judicial proceeding regarding enforcement of municipal rights under this section, the prevailing party is entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees from the nonprevailing party.
    
    (i)  A lien acquired under this section by a municipality for repair expenses may not be foreclosed if the property on which the repairs were made is occupied as a residential homestead by a person 65 years of age or older.
    
    (j)  The municipality by order may assess and recover a civil penalty against a property owner at the time of an administrative hearing on violations of an ordinance, in an amount not to exceed $1,000 a day for each violation or, if the owner shows that the property is the owner's lawful homestead, in an amount not to exceed $10 a day for each violation, if the municipality proves:
    
    (1)  the property owner was notified of the requirements of the ordinance and the owner's need to comply with the requirements;  and
    
    (2)  after notification, the property owner committed an act in violation of the ordinance or failed to take an action necessary for compliance with the ordinance.
    
    (k)  An assessment of a civil penalty under Subsection (j) is final and binding and constitutes prima facie evidence of the penalty in any suit brought by a municipality in a court of competent jurisdiction for a final judgment in accordance with the assessed penalty.
    
    (l)  To enforce a civil penalty under this subchapter, the clerk or secretary of the municipality must file with the district clerk of the county in which the municipality is located a certified copy of an order issued under Subsection (j) stating the amount and duration of the penalty.  No other proof is required for a district court to enter a final judgment on the penalty.

    Sec. 214.003.  RECEIVER.
    
    (a)  A home-rule municipality may bring an action in district court against an owner of property that is not in substantial compliance with:
    
    (1)  the municipal ordinances regarding:
    
    (A)  fire protection;
    
    (B)  structural integrity;
    
    (C)  zoning; or
    
    (D)  disposal of refuse; or
    
    (2)  a municipal ordinance described by Section [54.012](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=54.012)(1), (2), (5), (6), (7), or (9).
    
    (b)  Except as provided by Subsections (b-1) and (c), the court may appoint as a receiver for the property a nonprofit organization or an individual with a demonstrated record of rehabilitating properties if the court finds that:
    
    (1)  the structures on the property are in violation of the standards set forth in Section [214.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=214.001)(b) and an ordinance described by Subsection (a);
    
    (2)  notice of violation was given to the record owner of the property; and
    
    (3)  a public hearing as required by Section [214.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=214.001)(b) has been conducted.
    
    (b-1)  This subsection applies only to a municipality wholly or partly located in a county that is located along the international border and contains a municipality with a population of 500,000 or more.  The court may appoint as a receiver under Subsection (b) an individual without a demonstrated record of rehabilitating properties if the municipality demonstrates that:
    
    (1)  no individual with a demonstrated record of rehabilitating properties is available; and
    
    (2)  the individual being appointed is competent and able to fulfill the duties of a receiver.
    
    (c)  A receiver appointed under Subsection (b) may act as a receiver for any property, including historic property subject to Section [214.00111](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=214.00111).
    
    (d)  For the purposes of this section, if the record owner does not appear at the hearing required by Section [214.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=214.001)(b), the hearing shall be conducted as if the owner had personally appeared.
    
    (e)  In the action, the record owners and any lienholders of record of the property shall be served with personal notice of the proceedings or, if not available after due diligence, may be served by publication.  Actual service or service by publication on the record owners or lienholders constitutes notice to all unrecorded owners or lienholders.
    
    (f)  The court may issue, on a showing of imminent risk of injury to any person occupying the property or a person in the community, any mandatory or prohibitory temporary restraining orders and temporary injunctions necessary to protect the public health and safety.
    
    (g)  A receiver appointed by the court may:
    
    (1)  take control of the property;
    
    (2)  collect rents due on the property;
    
    (3)  make or have made any repairs necessary to bring the property into compliance with:
    
    (A)  minimum standards in local ordinances;  or
    
    (B)  guidelines for rehabilitating historic properties established by the secretary of the interior under 16 U.S.C.A. Section 470 et seq. or the municipal historic preservation board, if the property is considered historic property under Section [214.00111](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=214.00111);
    
    (4)  make payments necessary for the maintenance or restoration of utilities to the properties;
    
    (5)  purchase materials necessary to accomplish repairs;
    
    (6)  renew existing rental contracts and leases;
    
    (7)  enter into new rental contracts and leases;
    
    (8)  affirm, renew, or enter into a new contract providing for insurance coverage on the property;  and
    
    (9)  exercise all other authority that an owner of the property would have except for the authority to sell the property.
    
    (h)  On the completion of the restoration of the property to the minimum code standards of the municipality or guidelines for rehabilitating historic property, or before petitioning a court for termination of the receivership under Subsection (l):
    
    (1)  the receiver shall file with the court a full accounting of all costs and expenses incurred in the repairs, including reasonable costs for labor and supervision, all income received from the property, and, at the receiver's discretion, a receivership fee of 10 percent of those costs and expenses;
    
    (2)  if the income exceeds the total of the cost and expense of rehabilitation and any receivership fee, the rehabilitated property shall be restored to the owners and any net income shall be returned to the owners; and
    
    (3)  if the total of the costs and expenses and any receivership fee exceeds the income received during the receivership, the receiver may maintain control of the property until the time all rehabilitation and maintenance costs and any receivership fee are recovered, or until the receivership is terminated.
    
    (h-1)  A receiver shall have a lien on the property under receivership for all of the receiver's unreimbursed costs and expenses and any receivership fee.
    
    (i)  Any record lienholder may, after initiation of an action by a municipality:
    
    (1)  intervene in the action; and
    
    (2)  request appointment as a receiver:
    
    (A)  under the same conditions as the nonprofit organization or individual; and
    
    (B)  on a demonstration to the court of an ability and willingness to rehabilitate the property.
    
    (j)  For the purposes of this section, the interests and rights of an unrecorded lienholder or unrecorded property owner are, in all respects, inferior to the rights of a duly appointed receiver.
    
    (k)  The court may not appoint a receiver for any property that is an owner-occupied, single-family residence.
    
    (l)  A receiver appointed by a district court under this section, or the home-rule municipality that filed the action under which the receiver was appointed, may petition the court to terminate the receivership and order the sale of the property after the receiver has been in control of the property for more than one year, if an owner has been served with notice but has failed to assume control or repay all rehabilitation and maintenance costs and any receivership fee of the receiver.
    
    (m)  In the action, the record owners and any lienholders of record of the property shall be served with personal notice of the proceedings or, if not found after due diligence, may be served by publication.  Actual service or service by publication on all record owners and lienholders of record constitutes notice to all unrecorded owners and lienholders.
    
    (n)  The court may order the sale of the property if the court finds that:
    
    (1)  notice was given to each record owner of the property and each lienholder of record;
    
    (2)  the receiver has been in control of the property for more than one year and an owner has failed to repay all rehabilitation and maintenance costs and any receivership fee of the receiver; and
    
    (3)  no lienholder of record has intervened in the action and offered to repay the costs and any receivership fee of the receiver and assume control of the property.
    
    (o)  The court shall order the sale to be conducted by the petitioner in the same manner that a sale is conducted under Chapter [51](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=51), Property Code.  If the record owners and lienholders are identified, notice of the date and time of the sale must be sent in the same manner as provided by Chapter [51](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=51), Property Code.  If the owner cannot be located after due diligence, the owner may be served notice by publication.  The receiver may bid on the property at the sale and may use a lien granted under Subsection (h-1) as credit toward the purchase.  The petitioner shall make a report of the sale to the court.
    
    (p)  The court shall confirm the sale and order a distribution of the proceeds of the sale in the following order:
    
    (1)  court costs;
    
    (2)  costs and expenses of the receiver, and any lien held by the receiver; and
    
    (3)  other valid liens.
    
    (q)  Any remaining sums must be paid to the owner.  If the owner is not identified or cannot be located, the court shall order the remaining sums to be deposited in an interest-bearing account with the district clerk's office in the district in which the action is pending, and the clerk shall hold the funds as provided by other law.
    
    (r)  After the proceeds are distributed, the court shall award fee title to the purchaser subject to any recorded bona fide liens that were not paid by the proceeds of the sale.

    (1)  "Eligible nonprofit housing organization" means a nonprofit housing organization that is certified by a home-rule municipality to bring an action under this section.
    
    (2)  "Multifamily residential property" means any residential dwelling complex consisting of four or more units.

    (2)  the prevention of an adverse health impact to any person.
    
    (d)  A municipality that grants authority to an eligible nonprofit housing organization to initiate an action under this section has standing to intervene in the proceedings at any time as a matter of right.
    
    (e)  The court may appoint a receiver if the court finds that:
    
    (1)  the property is in violation of one or more ordinances of the municipality described by Subsection (c);
    
    (2)  the condition of the property constitutes a serious and imminent public health or safety hazard; and

    Sec. 214.101.  AUTHORITY REGARDING SWIMMING POOL ENCLOSURES.  (a)  A municipality may by ordinance establish minimum standards for swimming pool fences and enclosures and may adopt other ordinances as necessary to carry out this subchapter.

    (b)  A municipality that adopts an ordinance under this subchapter may repair, replace, secure, or otherwise remedy an enclosure or fence that is damaged, deteriorated, substandard, dilapidated, or otherwise in a state that poses a hazard to the public health, safety, and welfare.
    
    (c)  A municipality may require the owner of the property on which the swimming pool or enclosure or fence is situated, after notice and hearing as provided in Sections [214.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=214.001)(d) and (e), to repair, replace, secure, or otherwise remedy an enclosure or fence of a swimming pool that the municipality or an appropriate municipal official, agent, or employee determines violates the minimum standards adopted under this subchapter.
    
    (d)  If the enclosure or fence is on unoccupied property or is on property occupied only by persons who do not have a right of possession to the property, the municipality shall give notice to the owner, in accordance with the procedures set out in Sections [214.0011](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=214.0011)(c) and (d), of the municipality's action to repair, replace, secure, or otherwise remedy an enclosure or fence of a swimming pool.

The lien is extinguished if the property owner or another person having an interest in the legal title to the property reimburses the municipality for the expenses.  The lien arises and attaches to the property at the time the notice of the lien is recorded in the office of the county clerk in the county in which the property is situated.  The notice must contain the name and address of the owner if that information can be determined with a reasonable effort, a legal description of the real property on which the swimming pool or the enclosure or fence is situated, the amount of expenses incurred by the municipality, and the balance due.  The lien is a privileged lien subordinate only to tax liens and all previously recorded bona fide mortgage liens attached to the real property to which the municipality's lien attaches.

A municipality and its officials, agents, or employees shall be immune from liability for any acts or omissions not knowingly done that are associated with actions taken in an effort to eliminate the dangerous conditions posed by an enclosure or fence that is damaged, deteriorated, substandard, dilapidated, or otherwise in a state that poses a hazard to the public health, safety, and welfare and for any previous or subsequent conditions on the property.
    
    (h)  The authority granted by this subchapter is in addition to that granted by any other law.
