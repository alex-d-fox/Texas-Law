    (b)  In determining the best value for the municipality, the municipality may consider:
    
    (1)  the purchase price;
    
    (2)  the reputation of the bidder and of the bidder's goods or services;

Section 121.201.
    
    (c)  Before awarding a contract under this section, a municipality must indicate in the bid specifications and requirements that the contract may be awarded either to the lowest responsible bidder or to the bidder who provides goods or services at the best value for the municipality.
    
    (d)  Except as provided by Subsection (d-1), the contract must be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder if the competitive sealed bidding requirement applies to the contract for construction of:

    (f)  The governing body may reject any and all bids.
    
    (g)  A bid that has been opened may not be changed for the purpose of correcting an error in the bid price.  This chapter does not change the common law right of a bidder to withdraw a bid due to a material mistake in the bid.
    
    (h)   If the competitive sealed proposals requirement applies to the contract, the contract must be awarded to the responsible offeror whose proposal is determined to be the most advantageous to the municipality considering the relative importance of price and the other evaluation factors included in the request for proposals.
