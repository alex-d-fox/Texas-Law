    Sec. 393.002.  LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS;  PURPOSE.  (a)  The legislature has found in the Housing Authorities Law (Chapter [392](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=392)) that:
    
    (1)  unsafe and unsanitary housing conditions exist in this state for persons of low income;
    
    (2)  there is a shortage of safe and sanitary dwellings for those persons;
    
    (3)  those conditions require excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for crime prevention and punishment, public health and safety, fire and accident protection, and other public services and facilities;  and
    
    (4)  the public interest requires the remedying of those conditions.
    
    (b)  The legislature finds and declares that:
    
    (1)  the assistance provided under this chapter to remedy the conditions described in the Housing Authorities Law constitutes a public purpose and an essential governmental function for which public money may be spent and other aid given;
    
    (2)  it is a proper public purpose for a public body to aid a housing authority that operates within the boundaries or jurisdiction of the public body or to aid a housing project within its boundaries or jurisdiction because the public body derives immediate benefits and advantages from the authority or project;  and
    
    (3)  this chapter is necessary in the public interest.

The notice must state that at the expiration of 60 days the governing body will consider the question of whether to enter into a cooperation agreement.
    
    (b)  If, during the 60-day period, a petition signed by at least 2,000 of the qualified voters of the public body or by at least five percent of the qualified voters of the public body is presented to the governing body requesting that an election be held on the question, and if the petition is determined to have been signed by the requisite number of qualified voters, the governing body shall order an election to be held in the public body on the question.  Two weeks' notice of the election must be given in the manner required by law for elections on the question of issuing tax-supported bonds.  If a majority of the votes received in the election favor the cooperation agreement, the governing body shall execute the agreement.
    
    (c)  The governing body may also order such an election on its own motion.  If a majority of the votes received in the election favor the cooperation agreement, the governing body may execute the agreement.
    
    (d)  If the governing body fails or refuses to give notice of its intention to enter a cooperation agreement with a housing authority or fails or refuses to submit the question to an election as provided by Subsection (c), then, on filing of a petition demanding an election and signed by at least 2,000 of the qualified voters of the public body or by at least five percent of the qualified voters of the public body, the governing body shall order an election to be held in the public body for the purpose of submitting a proposition for the approval of the cooperation agreement.
