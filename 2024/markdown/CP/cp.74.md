(a)  In a suit against a physician or health care provider involving a health care liability claim that is based on the negligent failure of the physician or health care provider to disclose or adequately disclose the risks and hazards involved in the medical care or surgical procedure rendered by the physician or health care provider:
    
    (1)  both disclosure made as provided in Section [74.104](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=74.104) and failure to disclose based on inclusion of any medical care or surgical procedure on the panel's list for which disclosure is not required shall be admissible in evidence and shall create a rebuttable presumption that the requirements of Sections [74.104](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=74.104) and [74.105](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=74.105) have been complied with and this presumption shall be included in the charge to the jury;  and
    
    (2)  failure to disclose the risks and hazards involved in any medical care or surgical procedure required to be disclosed under Sections [74.104](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=74.104) and [74.105](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=74.105) shall be admissible in evidence and shall create a rebuttable presumption of a negligent failure to conform to the duty of disclosure set forth in Sections [74.104](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=74.104) and [74.105](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=74.105), and this presumption shall be included in the charge to the jury;  but failure to disclose may be found not to be negligent if there was an emergency or if for some other reason it was not medically feasible to make a disclosure of the kind that would otherwise have been negligence.
    
    (b)  If medical care or surgical procedure is rendered with respect to which the disclosure panel has made no determination either way regarding a duty of disclosure, the physician or health care provider is under the duty otherwise imposed by law.

    (6)  a description of the risks and hazards involved in the performance of the procedure;  and

    (2)  the individual who suffered injury or death was diagnosed or reasonably suspected to be infected with a pandemic disease at the time of the care, treatment, or failure to provide care or treatment.

The date for serving the report may be extended by written agreement of the affected parties.  Each defendant physician or health care provider whose conduct is implicated in a report must file and serve any objection to the sufficiency of the report not later than the later of the 21st day after the date the report is served or the 21st day after the date the defendant's answer is filed, failing which all objections are waived.

    SUBCHAPTER I. EXPERT WITNESSES
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 74.401.  QUALIFICATIONS OF EXPERT WITNESS IN SUIT AGAINST PHYSICIAN.  (a)  In a suit involving a health care liability claim against a physician for injury to or death of a patient, a person may qualify as an expert witness on the issue of whether the physician departed from accepted standards of medical care only if the person is a physician who:
    
    (1)  is practicing medicine at the time such testimony is given or was practicing medicine at the time the claim arose;
    
    (2)  has knowledge of accepted standards of medical care for the diagnosis, care, or treatment of the illness, injury, or condition involved in the claim;  and
    
    (3)  is qualified on the basis of training or experience to offer an expert opinion regarding those accepted standards of medical care.
    
    (b)  For the purpose of this section, "practicing medicine" or "medical practice" includes, but is not limited to, training residents or students at an accredited school of medicine or osteopathy or serving as a consulting physician to other physicians who provide direct patient care, upon the request of such other physicians.
    
    (c)  In determining whether a witness is qualified on the basis of training or experience, the court shall consider whether, at the time the claim arose or at the time the testimony is given, the witness:
    
    (1)  is board certified or has other substantial training or experience in an area of medical practice relevant to the claim;  and
    
    (2)  is actively practicing medicine in rendering medical care services relevant to the claim.
    
    (d)  The court shall apply the criteria specified in Subsections (a), (b), and (c) in determining whether an expert is qualified to offer expert testimony on the issue of whether the physician departed from accepted standards of medical care, but may depart from those criteria if, under the circumstances, the court determines that there is a good reason to admit the expert's testimony.  The court shall state on the record the reason for admitting the testimony if the court departs from the criteria.
    
    (e)  A pretrial objection to the qualifications of a witness under this section must be made not later than the later of the 21st day after the date the objecting party receives a copy of the witness's curriculum vitae or the 21st day after the date of the witness's deposition.  If circumstances arise after the date on which the objection must be made that could not have been reasonably anticipated by a party before that date and that the party believes in good faith provide a basis for an objection to a witness's qualifications, and if an objection was not made previously, this subsection does not prevent the party from making an objection as soon as practicable under the circumstances.  The court shall conduct a hearing to determine whether the witness is qualified as soon as practicable after the filing of an objection and, if possible, before trial.  If the objecting party is unable to object in time for the hearing to be conducted before the trial, the hearing shall be conducted outside the presence of the jury.  This subsection does not prevent a party from examining or cross-examining a witness at trial about the witness's qualifications.
    
    (f)  This section does not prevent a physician who is a defendant from qualifying as an expert.
    
    (g)  In this subchapter, "physician" means a person who is:
    
    (1)  licensed to practice medicine in one or more states in the United States;  or
    
    (2)  a graduate of a medical school accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education or the American Osteopathic Association only if testifying as a defendant and that testimony relates to that defendant's standard of care, the alleged departure from that standard of care, or the causal relationship between the alleged departure from that standard of care and the injury, harm, or damages claimed.

    (2)  serving as a consulting health care provider and being licensed, certified, or registered in the same field as the defendant health care provider.
    
    (b)  In a suit involving a health care liability claim against a health care provider, a person may qualify as an expert witness on the issue of whether the health care provider departed from accepted standards of care only if the person:
    
    (1)  is practicing health care in a field of practice that involves the same type of care or treatment as that delivered by the defendant health care provider, if the defendant health care provider is an individual, at the time the testimony is given or was practicing that type of health care at the time the claim arose;
    
    (2)  has knowledge of accepted standards of care for health care providers for the diagnosis, care, or treatment of the illness, injury, or condition involved in the claim;  and
    
    (3)  is qualified on the basis of training or experience to offer an expert opinion regarding those accepted standards of health care.
    
    (c)  In determining whether a witness is qualified on the basis of training or experience, the court shall consider whether, at the time the claim arose or at the time the testimony is given, the witness:
    
    (1)  is certified by a licensing agency of one or more states of the United States or a national professional certifying agency, or has other substantial training or experience, in the area of health care relevant to the claim;  and
    
    (2)  is actively practicing health care in rendering health care services relevant to the claim.
    
    (d)  The court shall apply the criteria specified in Subsections (a), (b), and (c) in determining whether an expert is qualified to offer expert testimony on the issue of whether the defendant health care provider departed from accepted standards of health care but may depart from those criteria if, under the circumstances, the court determines that there is good reason to admit the expert's testimony.  The court shall state on the record the reason for admitting the testimony if the court departs from the criteria.
    
    (e)  This section does not prevent a health care provider who is a defendant, or an employee of the defendant health care provider, from qualifying as an expert.
    
    (f)  A pretrial objection to the qualifications of a witness under this section must be made not later than the later of the 21st day after the date the objecting party receives a copy of the witness's curriculum vitae or the 21st day after the date of the witness's deposition.  If circumstances arise after the date on which the objection must be made that could not have been reasonably anticipated by a party before that date and that the party believes in good faith provide a basis for an objection to a witness's qualifications, and if an objection was not made previously, this subsection does not prevent the party from making an objection as soon as practicable under the circumstances.  The court shall conduct a hearing to determine whether the witness is qualified as soon as practicable after the filing of an objection and, if possible, before trial.  If the objecting party is unable to object in time for the hearing to be conducted before the trial, the hearing shall be conducted outside the presence of the jury.  This subsection does not prevent a party from examining or cross-examining a witness at trial about the witness's qualifications.
