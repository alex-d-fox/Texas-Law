(a)  An action for damages for the death or personal injury of a citizen of this state, of the United States, or of a foreign country may be enforced in the courts of this state, although the wrongful act, neglect, or default causing the death or injury takes place in a foreign state or country, if:
    
    (1)  a law of the foreign state or country or of this state gives a right to maintain an action for damages for the death or injury;
    
    (2)  the action is begun in this state within the time provided by the laws of this state for beginning the action;  
    
    (3)  for a resident of a foreign state or country, the action is begun in this state within the time provided by the laws of the foreign state or country in which the wrongful act, neglect, or default took place;  and
    
    (4)  in the case of a citizen of a foreign country, the country has equal treaty rights with the United States on behalf of its citizens.
    
    (b)  Except as provided by Subsection (a), all matters pertaining to procedure in the prosecution or maintenance of the action in the courts of this state are governed by the law of this state.

    SUBCHAPTER D. FORUM NON CONVENIENS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 71.051.  FORUM NON CONVENIENS.  (a)  Repealed by Acts 2003, 78th Leg., ch. 204, Sec. 3.09.
    
    (b)  If a court of this state, on written motion of a party, finds that in the interest of justice and for the convenience of the parties a claim or action to which this section applies would be more properly heard in a forum outside this state, the court shall decline to exercise jurisdiction under the doctrine of forum non conveniens and shall stay or dismiss the claim or action.  In determining whether to grant a motion to stay or dismiss an action under the doctrine of forum non conveniens, the court shall consider whether:
    
    (1)  an alternate forum exists in which the claim or action may be tried;
    
    (2)  the alternate forum provides an adequate remedy;
    
    (3)  maintenance of the claim or action in the courts of this state would work a substantial injustice to the moving party;
    
    (4)  the alternate forum, as a result of the submission of the parties or otherwise, can exercise jurisdiction over all the defendants properly joined to the plaintiff's claim;
    
    (5)  the balance of the private interests of the parties and the public interest of the state predominate in favor of the claim or action being brought in an alternate forum, which shall include consideration of the extent to which an injury or death resulted from acts or omissions that occurred in this state; and
    
    (6)  the stay or dismissal would not result in unreasonable duplication or proliferation of litigation.
    
    (c)  The court may set terms and conditions for staying or dismissing a claim or action under this section as the interests of justice may require, giving due regard to the rights of the parties to the claim or action.  If a moving party violates a term or condition of a stay or dismissal, the court shall withdraw the order staying or dismissing the claim or action and proceed as if the order had never been issued.  Notwithstanding any other law, the court shall have continuing jurisdiction for purposes of this subsection.
    
    (d)  A request for stay or dismissal under this section is timely if it is filed not later than 180 days after the time required for filing a motion to transfer venue of the claim or action. The court may rule on a motion filed under this section only after a hearing with notice to all parties not less than 21 days before the date specified for the hearing.  The court shall afford all of the parties ample opportunity to obtain discovery of information relevant to the motion prior to a hearing on a motion under this section.  The moving party shall have the responsibility to request and obtain a hearing on such motion at a reasonable time prior to commencement of the trial, and in no case shall the hearing be held less than 30 days prior to trial.
    
    (e)  The court may not stay or dismiss a plaintiff's claim under Subsection (b) if the plaintiff is a legal resident of this state or a derivative claimant of a legal resident of this state.  The determination of whether a claim may be stayed or dismissed under Subsection (b) shall be made with respect to each plaintiff without regard to whether the claim of any other plaintiff may be stayed or dismissed under Subsection (b) and without regard to a plaintiff's country of citizenship or national origin.  If an action involves both plaintiffs who are legal residents of this state and plaintiffs who are not, the court shall consider the factors provided by Subsection (b) and determine whether to deny the motion or to stay or dismiss the claim of any plaintiff who is not a legal resident of this state.
    
    (f)  A court that grants a motion to stay or dismiss an action under the doctrine of forum non conveniens shall set forth specific findings of fact and conclusions of law.
    
    (g)  Any time limit established by this section may be extended by the court at the request of any party for good cause shown.
    
    (h)  For purposes of Subsection (e):
    
    (1)  "Derivative claimant" means a person whose damages were caused by personal injury to or the wrongful death of another.
    
    (2)  "Plaintiff" means a party seeking recovery of damages for personal injury or wrongful death.   The term does not include:
    
    (A)  a counterclaimant, cross-claimant, or third-party plaintiff or a person who is assigned a cause of action for personal injury; or
    
    (B)  a representative, administrator, guardian, or next friend who is not otherwise a derivative claimant of a legal resident of this state.
    
    (i)  This section applies to actions for personal injury or wrongful death.  This section shall govern the courts of this state in determining issues under the doctrine of forum non conveniens in the actions to which it applies, notwithstanding Section [71.031](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=71.031)(a) or any other law.
