    SUBCHAPTER A. DEFINITIONS;  GENERAL RULES
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 15.001.  DEFINITIONS.  In this chapter:
    
    (a)  "Principal office" means a principal office of the corporation, unincorporated association, or partnership in this state in which the decision makers for the organization within this state conduct the daily affairs of the organization.  The mere presence of an agency or representative does not establish a principal office.
    
    (b)  "Proper venue" means:
    
    (1)  the venue required by the mandatory provisions of Subchapter B or another statute prescribing mandatory venue;  or
    
    (2)  if Subdivision (1) does not apply, the venue provided by this subchapter or Subchapter C.
    
    
    
    
    Added by Acts 1995, 74th Leg., ch. 138, Sec. 1, eff. Aug. 28, 1995.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 15.002.  VENUE:  GENERAL RULE.  (a)  Except as otherwise provided by this subchapter or Subchapter B or C, all lawsuits shall be brought:
    
    (1)  in the county in which all or a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred;
    
    (2)  in the county of defendant's residence at the time the cause of action accrued if defendant is a natural person;
    
    (3)  in the county of the defendant's principal office in this state, if the defendant is not a natural person;  or
    
    (4)  if Subdivisions (1), (2), and (3) do not apply, in the county in which the plaintiff resided at the time of the accrual of the cause of action.
    
    (b)  For the convenience of the parties and witnesses and in the interest of justice, a court may transfer an action from a county of proper venue under this subchapter or Subchapter C to any other county of proper venue on motion of a defendant filed and served concurrently with or before the filing of the answer, where the court finds:
    
    (1)  maintenance of the action in the county of suit would work an injustice to the movant considering the movant's economic and personal hardship;
    
    (2)  the balance of interests of all the parties predominates in favor of the action being brought in the other county;  and
    
    (3)  the transfer of the action would not work an injustice to any other party.
    
    (c)  A court's ruling or decision to grant or deny a transfer under Subsection (b) is not grounds for appeal or mandamus and is not reversible error.

    Sec. 15.003.  MULTIPLE PLAINTIFFS AND INTERVENING PLAINTIFFS.  (a)  In a suit in which there is more than one plaintiff, whether the plaintiffs are included by joinder, by intervention, because the lawsuit was begun by more than one plaintiff, or otherwise, each plaintiff must, independently of every other plaintiff, establish proper venue.  If a plaintiff cannot independently establish proper venue, that plaintiff's part of the suit, including all of that plaintiff's claims and causes of action, must be transferred to a county of proper venue or dismissed, as is appropriate, unless that plaintiff, independently of every other plaintiff, establishes that:
    
    (1)  joinder of that plaintiff or intervention in the suit by that plaintiff is proper under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure;
    
    (2)  maintaining venue as to that plaintiff in the county of suit does not unfairly prejudice another party to the suit;
    
    (3)  there is an essential need to have that plaintiff's claim tried in the county in which the suit is pending;  and
    
    (4)  the county in which the suit is pending is a fair and convenient venue for that plaintiff and all persons against whom the suit is brought.
    
    (b)  An interlocutory appeal may be taken of a trial court's determination under Subsection (a) that:
    
    (1)  a plaintiff did or did not independently establish proper venue;  or
    
    (2)  a plaintiff that did not independently establish proper venue did or did not establish the items prescribed by Subsections (a)(1)-(4).
    
    (c)  An interlocutory appeal permitted by Subsection (b) must be taken to the court of appeals district in which the trial court is located under the procedures established for interlocutory appeals.  The appeal may be taken by a party that is affected by the trial court's determination under Subsection (a). The court of appeals shall:
    
    (1)  determine whether the trial court's order is proper based on an independent determination from the record and not under either an abuse of discretion or substantial evidence standard;  and
    
    (2)  render judgment not later than the 120th day after the date the appeal is perfected.
    
    (d)  An interlocutory appeal under Subsection (b) has the effect of staying the commencement of trial in the trial court pending resolution of the appeal.
