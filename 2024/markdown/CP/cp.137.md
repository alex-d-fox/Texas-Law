    NOTICE TO PERSON MAKING A DECLARATION FOR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT
    
      
    
    
    This is an important legal document.  It creates a declaration for mental health treatment.  Before signing this document, you should know these important facts:
    
    This document allows you to make decisions in advance about mental health treatment and specifically three types of mental health treatment:  psychoactive medication, convulsive therapy, and emergency mental health treatment.  The instructions that you include in this declaration will be followed only if a court believes that you are incapacitated to make treatment decisions.  Otherwise, you will be considered able to give or withhold consent for the treatments.
    
    This document will continue in effect for a period of three years unless you become incapacitated to participate in mental health treatment decisions.  If this occurs, the directive will continue in effect until you are no longer incapacitated.
    
    You have the right to revoke this document in whole or in part at any time you have not been determined to be incapacitated.  YOU MAY NOT REVOKE THIS DECLARATION WHEN YOU ARE CONSIDERED BY A COURT TO BE INCAPACITATED. A revocation is effective when it is communicated to your attending physician or other health care provider.
    
    If there is anything in this document that you do not understand, you should ask a lawyer to explain it to you.  This declaration is not valid unless it is either acknowledged before a notary public or signed by two qualified witnesses who are personally known to you and who are present when you sign or acknowledge your signature.
