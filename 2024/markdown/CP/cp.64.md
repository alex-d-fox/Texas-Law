    Sec. 64.092.  RECEIVER FOR CONTINGENT INTERESTS IN MINERALS.  (a)  On the application of a person who has a vested, contingent, or possible interest in land or an estate subject to a contingent future interest, a district court of the county in which all or part of the land is located may appoint a receiver for the land or estate, pending the occurrence of the contingency and the vesting of the future interest, if:
    
    (1)  the land or estate is susceptible to drainage of oil, gas, or other minerals;
    
    (2)  lease of the land for oil, gas, or mineral development and the safe and proper investment of the proceeds will inure to the benefit and advantage of the persons entitled to the proceeds;  or
    
    (3)  lease of the land for the production of oil, gas, or other minerals is necessary for the conservation, preservation, or protection of the land or estate or of a present, contingent, or future interest in the land or estate.
    
    (b)  As authorized or directed by the court, a receiver appointed under Subsection (a) may:
    
    (1)  lease the land for the development of oil, gas, or other minerals at public or private sale and on terms and conditions directed by the court;  and
    
    (2)  receive, hold, and invest the proceeds of the lease for the benefit of persons who are entitled or may become entitled to those proceeds according to their respective rights and interests.
    
    (c)  On the application of a person who has a vested, contingent, or possible interest in land or an estate that is under an oil, gas, or mineral lease and is subject to a contingent future interest, a district court of the county in which all or part of the land is located may appoint a receiver for the contingent future interests, pending the occurrence of the contingency and the vesting of the future interest, if:
    
    (1)  the lease fails to provide for pooling or contains pooling provisions that are ineffective as to the contingent future interest covered by the lease;  and
    
    (2)  the pooling of the contingent future interest:
    
    (A)  is necessary to protect correlative rights;
    
    (B)  is necessary to prevent the physical or economic waste of oil, gas, or other minerals;
    
    (C)  will inure to the benefit and advantage of the persons entitled to the future interest;  or
    
    (D)  is necessary for the conservation, preservation, or protection of the land or estate or of a present, contingent, or future interest in the land or estate.
    
    (d)  The lessee or an assignee of the lessee may apply for appointment of a receiver under Subsection (c).  As authorized or directed by the court, the receiver appointed under that subsection may:
    
    (1)  amend the lease to authorize pooling for the contingent future interest on terms and conditions and for additional consideration directed by the court;  and
    
    (2)  receive, hold, and invest the additional consideration for the benefit of the persons who are entitled or may become entitled to that consideration, according to their respective rights and interests.
    
    (e)  A court appointing a receiver under this section may confer on the receiver all powers necessary to the exercise of the receiver's authority.
    
    (f)  A lease executed or amended by a receiver under this section may authorize the lessee and his assigns to pool all or part of the land subject to the lease with adjacent land into a unit not to exceed 160 acres for an oil well or 640 acres for a gas well plus 10 percent tolerance or into a unit that substantially conforms to a larger unit prescribed or permitted by governmental rule.
    
    (g)  In an action for appointment of a receiver under this section, a person who has a vested, contingent, or possible interest in the land must be cited in the manner and for the time provided for in actions concerning title to land.  A person not in being must be cited in the manner and for the time provided in actions against unknown owners or claimants of interest in land.  In an action brought under Subsection (c), a person is not a necessary party if:
    
    (1)  the person's interest in the land subject to the lease is effectively subject to pooling authority under the lease;  and
    
    (2)  enlargement of the pooling authority as to the person's interest is not sought.
    
    (h)  The court appointing a receiver under this section may order that, after payment of court costs, money paid to the receiver be deposited in the registry of the court for the use and benefit of the persons who are entitled or may become entitled to the money, according to their respective rights and interests.  If the court then discharges the receiver, it may order that later payments under the lease accruing to the contingent future interest be deposited in the same manner and for the same purpose.
    
    (i)  This section does not apply to a mineral lease on land on which drilling began before October 5, 1949.  This section does not authorize a lease of mineral interests on land subject to existing homestead rights without the written consent of the owner of the homestead rights given in the manner provided by law for the conveyance of homesteads.
    
    (j)  In this section, "contingent future interest" means a legal or equitable interest arising by way of remainder, reversion, possibility of reverter, executory devise, on the occurrence of a condition subsequent, or otherwise.

    Sec. 64.093.  RECEIVER FOR ROYALTY INTERESTS OWNED BY NONRESIDENT OR ABSENTEE.  (a)  A district court may appoint a receiver for the royalty interest owned by a nonresident or absent defendant in an action that:
    
    (1)  is brought by a person claiming or owning an undivided mineral interest in land in this state or an undivided leasehold interest under a mineral lease of land in the state;  and
    
    (2)  has one or more defendants who have, claim, or own an undivided royalty interest in that property.
    
    (b)  The defendant for whom the receiver is sought must:
    
    (1)  be a person whose residence or identity is unknown or a nonresident;  and
    
    (2)  not have paid taxes on the interest or rendered it for taxes during the five-year period immediately preceding the filing of the action.
    
    (c)  The plaintiff in the action must allege by verified petition and prove that the plaintiff:
    
    (1)  has made a diligent but unsuccessful effort to locate the defendant;  and
    
    (2)  will suffer substantial damage or injury unless the receiver is appointed.
    
    (d)  In an action under Subsection (a):
    
    (1)  the plaintiff, in the petition, must name the last known owner or the last record owner of the interest as defendant;
    
    (2)  the plaintiff must serve notice on the defendant by publication as provided by the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure;
    
    (3)  the court may appoint as receiver the county judge or any other resident of the county in which the land is located;
    
    (4)  notwithstanding the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, the applicant is not required to post bond; and
    
    (5)  the receiver is not required to post bond.
    
    (e)  A receivership created under this section continues as long as the defendant or the defendant's heirs, assigns, or personal representatives fail to appear in court in person or by agent or attorney to claim the defendant's interest.
    
    (f)  As ordered by the court, the receiver shall immediately:
    
    (1)  ratify a mineral lease executed by a person owning an undivided mineral interest in the property;
    
    (2)  ratify a pooling agreement executed by a person owning an undivided mineral interest in the property or an undivided leasehold interest in the property;  or
    
    (3)  enter into a unitization agreement authorized by the Railroad Commission of Texas.
    
    (g)  A lease ratified by a receiver under this section may authorize the lessee to pool and unitize land subject to the lease with adjacent land into a unit not to exceed 160 acres for an oil well or 640 acres for a gas well plus 10 percent tolerance or into a unit that substantially conforms to a larger unit prescribed or permitted by governmental rule.  A pooling agreement ratified by a receiver under this section may allow a pooled unit not to exceed 160 acres for an oil well or 640 acres for a gas well plus 10 percent tolerance or into a unit that substantially conforms to a larger unit prescribed or permitted by governmental rule.
    
    (h)  The monetary consideration, if any, due for the execution of a ratification, pooling agreement, or unitization agreement by the receiver must be paid to the clerk of the court in which the case is pending before the receiver executes the instrument.  It is, however, recognized that, because ratifications, pooling agreements, and unitization agreements are typically entered into in consideration of the future benefits accruing to the grantor thereof, an initial monetary consideration is not typically paid for the execution of such instruments.  The court shall apply the money to the costs accruing in the case and retain any balance for the owner of the royalty interest.  Payments made at a later time under the lease, pooled unit, or unitization agreement shall be paid into the registry of the court and impounded for the owner of the royalty interest.
    
    (i)  This section is cumulative of other laws relating to removal of a cloud from title or appointment of a receiver.
    
    (j)  In this section:
    
    (1)  "Mineral lease" includes any lease of oil, gas, or other minerals that contains provisions necessary or incident to the orderly exploration, development, and recovery of oil, gas, or other minerals.
    
    (2)  "Leasehold interest" includes ownership created under a mineral lease or carved out of a leasehold estate granted under a mineral lease, including production payments, overriding royalty interests, and working interests.
    
    (3)  "Pooling agreement" includes any agreement that pools or unitizes land with adjacent land for production of oil, gas, or other minerals.
    
    (4)  "Royalty interest" includes any interest in the lands entitled to share in the production of oil, gas, or other minerals that is not required to execute a mineral lease or any other instrument in order to vest in the mineral interest owner or mineral leasehold interest owner the right and power, as to that interest, to develop oil, gas, or other minerals produced solely from those lands.
    
    (k)  To the extent that Subsection (d)(2) conflicts with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, Subsection (d)(2) controls.
