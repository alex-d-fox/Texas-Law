    CHAPTER 121. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND PROOFS OF WRITTEN INSTRUMENTS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 121.001.  OFFICERS WHO MAY TAKE ACKNOWLEDGMENTS OR PROOFS.  (a)  An acknowledgment or proof of a written instrument may be taken in this state by:

    (2)  a judge or clerk of a county court;
    
    (3)  a notary public;
    
    (4)  a county tax assessor-collector or an employee of the county tax assessor-collector if the instrument is required or authorized to be filed in the office of the county tax assessor-collector;  or
    
    (5)  an employee of a personal bond office if the acknowledgment or proof of a written instrument is required or authorized by Article [17.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=17.04), Code of Criminal Procedure.
    
    (b)  An acknowledgment or proof of a written instrument may be taken outside this state, but inside the United States or its territories, by:
    
    (1)  a clerk of a court of record having a seal;
    
    (2)  a commissioner of deeds appointed under the laws of this state;  or

    (c)  An acknowledgment or proof of a written instrument may be taken outside the United States or its territories by:

    (d)  A commissioned officer of the United States Armed Forces or of a United States Armed Forces Auxiliary may take an acknowledgment or proof of a written instrument of a member of the armed forces, a member of an armed forces auxiliary, or a member's spouse.  If an acknowledgment or a proof is taken under this subsection, it is presumed, absent pleading and proof to the contrary, that the commissioned officer who signed was a commissioned officer on the date that the officer signed, and that the acknowledging person was a member of the authorized group of military personnel or spouses.  The failure of the commissioned officer to attach an official seal to the certificate of acknowledgment or proof of an instrument does not invalidate the acknowledgment or proof.
