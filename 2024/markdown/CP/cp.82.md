    (e)  The duty to indemnify under this section:
    
    (1)  applies without regard to the manner in which the action is concluded;  and
    
    (2)  is in addition to any duty to indemnify established by law, contract, or otherwise.

    Sec. 82.003.  LIABILITY OF NONMANUFACTURING SELLERS.  (a)  A seller that did not manufacture a product is not liable for harm caused to the claimant by that product unless the claimant proves:
    
    (1)  that the seller participated in the design of the product;
    
    (2)  that the seller altered or modified the product and the claimant's harm resulted from that alteration or modification;
    
    (3)  that the seller installed the product, or had the product installed, on another product and the claimant's harm resulted from the product's installation onto the assembled product;
    
    (4)  that:
    
    (A)  the seller exercised substantial control over the content of a warning or instruction that accompanied the product;
    
    (B)  the warning or instruction was inadequate;  and
    
    (C)  the claimant's harm resulted from the inadequacy of the warning or instruction;
    
    (5)  that:
    
    (A)  the seller made an express factual representation about an aspect of the product;
    
    (B)  the representation was incorrect;
    
    (C)  the claimant relied on the representation in obtaining or using the product;  and
    
    (D)  if the aspect of the product had been as represented, the claimant would not have been harmed by the product or would not have suffered the same degree of harm;
    
    (6)  that:
    
    (A)  the seller actually knew of a defect to the product at the time the seller supplied the product;  and
    
    (B)  the claimant's harm resulted from the defect;  or
    
    (7)  that the manufacturer of the product is:
    
    (A)  insolvent;  or

In the event of a conflict, Chapter [2301](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=2301), Occupations Code, prevails over this section.
    
    (c)  If after service on a nonresident manufacturer through the secretary of state in the manner prescribed by Subchapter [C](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=17.041), Chapter [17](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=17), the manufacturer fails to answer or otherwise make an appearance in the time required by law, it is conclusively presumed for the purposes of Subsection (a)(7)(B) that the manufacturer is not subject to the jurisdiction of the court unless the seller is able to secure personal jurisdiction over the manufacturer in the action.

    Sec. 82.005.  DESIGN DEFECTS.  (a)  In a products liability action in which a claimant alleges a design defect, the burden is on the claimant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that:
    
    (1)  there was a safer alternative design;  and
    
    (2)  the defect was a producing cause of the personal injury, property damage, or death for which the claimant seeks recovery.
    
    (b)  In this section, "safer alternative design" means a product design other than the one actually used that in reasonable probability:

    Sec. 82.006.  FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION.  (a)  In a products liability action brought against a manufacturer or seller of a firearm or ammunition that alleges a design defect in the firearm or ammunition, the burden is on the claimant to prove, in addition to any other elements that the claimant must prove, that:
    
    (1)  the actual design of the firearm or ammunition was defective, causing the firearm or ammunition not to function in a manner reasonably expected by an ordinary consumer of firearms or ammunition;  and
    
    (2)  the defective design was a producing cause of the personal injury, property damage, or death.
    
    (b)  The claimant may not prove the existence of the defective design by a comparison or weighing of the benefits of the firearm or ammunition against the risk of personal injury, property damage, or death posed by its potential to cause such injury, damage, or death when discharged.

    Sec. 82.007.  MEDICINES.  (a)  In a products liability action alleging that an injury was caused by a failure to provide adequate warnings or information with regard to a pharmaceutical product, there is a rebuttable presumption that the defendant or defendants, including a health care provider, manufacturer, distributor, and prescriber, are not liable with respect to the allegations involving failure to provide adequate warnings or information if:
    
    (1)  the warnings or information that accompanied the product in its distribution were those approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for a product approved under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. Section 301 et seq.), as amended, or Section 351, Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. Section 262), as amended;  or
    
    (2)  the warnings provided were those stated in monographs developed by the United States Food and Drug Administration for pharmaceutical products that may be distributed without an approved new drug application.
    
    (b)  The claimant may rebut the presumption in Subsection (a) as to each defendant by establishing that:
    
    (1)  the defendant, before or after pre-market approval or licensing of the product, withheld from or misrepresented to the United States Food and Drug Administration required information that was material and relevant to the performance of the product and was causally related to the claimant's injury;
    
    (2)  the pharmaceutical product was sold or prescribed in the United States by the defendant after the effective date of an order of the United States Food and Drug Administration to remove the product from the market or to withdraw its approval of the product;
    
    (3)(A) the defendant recommended, promoted, or advertised the pharmaceutical product for an indication not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration;
    
    (B)  the product was used as recommended, promoted, or advertised;  and
    
    (C)  the claimant's injury was causally related to the recommended, promoted, or advertised use of the product;

    (B)  the product was used as prescribed;  and
    
    (C)  the claimant's injury was causally related to the prescribed use of the product;  or
    
    (5)  the defendant, before or after pre-market approval or licensing of the product, engaged in conduct that would constitute a violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 201 and that conduct caused the warnings or instructions approved for the product by the United States Food and Drug Administration to be inadequate.

    Sec. 82.008.  COMPLIANCE WITH GOVERNMENT STANDARDS.  (a)  In a products liability action brought against a product manufacturer or seller, there is a rebuttable presumption that the product manufacturer or seller is not liable for any injury to a claimant caused by some aspect of the formulation, labeling, or design of a product if the product manufacturer or seller establishes that the product's formula, labeling, or design complied with mandatory safety standards or regulations adopted and promulgated by the federal government, or an agency of the federal government, that were applicable to the product at the time of manufacture and that governed the product risk that allegedly caused harm.
    
    (b)  The claimant may rebut the presumption in Subsection (a) by establishing that:
    
    (1)  the mandatory federal safety standards or regulations applicable to the product were inadequate to protect the public from unreasonable risks of injury or damage;  or
    
    (2)  the manufacturer, before or after marketing the product, withheld or misrepresented information or material relevant to the federal government's or agency's determination of adequacy of the safety standards or regulations at issue in the action.
    
    (c)  In a products liability action brought against a product manufacturer or seller, there is a rebuttable presumption that the product manufacturer or seller is not liable for any injury to a claimant allegedly caused by some aspect of the formulation, labeling, or design of a product if the product manufacturer or seller establishes that the product was subject to pre-market licensing or approval by the federal government, or an agency of the federal government, that the manufacturer complied with all of the government's or agency's procedures and requirements with respect to pre-market licensing or approval, and that after full consideration of the product's risks and benefits the product was approved or licensed for sale by the government or agency.  The claimant may rebut this presumption by establishing that:
    
    (1)  the standards or procedures used in the particular pre-market approval or licensing process were inadequate to protect the public from unreasonable risks of injury or damage;  or
    
    (2)  the manufacturer, before or after pre-market approval or licensing of the product, withheld from or misrepresented to the government or agency information that was material and relevant to the performance of the product and was causally related to the claimant's injury.
    
    (d)  This section does not extend to manufacturing flaws or defects even though the product manufacturer has complied with all quality control and manufacturing practices mandated by the federal government or an agency of the federal government.
    
    (e)  This section does not extend to products covered by Section [82.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=82.007).

    (1)  routine maintenance; or

    (3)  that is not a motor vehicle that was manufactured primarily for use in the transportation of not more than 10 individuals.
    
    (c)  Except as provided by Subsection (d), in any civil action, including a products liability action, alleging negligence, gross negligence, or strict liability, a seller who rents or leases a motor vehicle to which this section applies to another person is not liable for failing to retrofit the vehicle with component parts or equipment, or for failing to select component parts or equipment included in the vehicle, that were not required by applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards under 49 C.F.R. Section 571.1 et seq. in effect at the time the vehicle was manufactured or sold.
    
    (d)  Subsection (c) does not apply if the seller fails to comply with a law or regulation, issued after the seller's motor vehicle was manufactured or sold, requiring a mandatory recall or retrofit of the vehicle.
