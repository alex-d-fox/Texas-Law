    Sec. 90.010.  MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION PROCEEDINGS.  (a)  The MDL rules apply to any action pending on the date this chapter becomes law in which the claimant alleges personal injury or death from exposure to asbestos or silica unless:
    
    (1)  the action was filed before September 1, 2003, and trial has commenced or is set to commence on or before the 90th day after the date this chapter becomes law, except that the MDL rules shall apply to the action if the trial does not commence on or before the 90th day after the date this chapter becomes law;
    
    (2)  the action was filed before September 1, 2003, and the claimant serves a report that complies with Section [90.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=90.003) or [90.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=90.004) on or before the 90th day after the date this chapter becomes law; or
    
    (3)  the action was filed before September 1, 2003, and the exposed person has been diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma, other malignant asbestos-related cancer, or malignant silica-related cancer.
    
    (b)  If the claimant fails to serve a report complying with Section [90.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=90.003) or [90.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=90.004) on or before the 90th day after the date this chapter becomes law under Subsection (a)(2), the defendant may file a notice of transfer to the MDL pretrial court.  If the MDL pretrial court determines that the claimant served a report that complies with Section [90.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=90.003) or [90.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=90.004) on or before the 90th day after the date this chapter becomes law, the MDL pretrial court shall remand the action to the court in which the action was filed.  If the MDL pretrial court determines that the report was not served on or before the 90th day after the date this chapter becomes law or that the report served does not comply with Section [90.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=90.003) or [90.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=90.004), the MDL pretrial court shall retain jurisdiction over the action pursuant to the MDL rules.
    
    (c)  In an action transferred to an MDL pretrial court in which the exposed person is living and has been diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma, other malignant asbestos-related cancer, malignant silica-related cancer, or acute silicosis, the MDL pretrial court shall expedite the action in a manner calculated to provide the exposed person with a trial or other disposition in the shortest period that is fair to all parties and consistent with the principles of due process.  The MDL pretrial court should, as far as reasonably possible, ensure that such action is brought to trial or final disposition within six months from the date the action is transferred to the MDL pretrial court, provided that all discovery and case management requirements of the MDL pretrial court have been satisfied.
    
    (d)  In an action that was pending on August 31, 2005, that was transferred to and remains pending in an MDL pretrial court, the MDL pretrial court shall not remand such action for trial unless:
    
    (1)  the claimant serves a report complying with Section [90.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=90.003) or [90.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=90.004); or

    (1)  the claimant serves a report that complies with Subsection (f)(1); and
    
    (2)  the court, on motion and hearing, makes the findings required by Subsection (f)(2).
    
    (f)  In an action in which the claimant seeks remand for trial under Subsection (d)(2) or denial of a motion to dismiss under Subsection (e):
    
    (1)  the claimant shall serve on each defendant a report that:
    
    (A)  complies with the requirements of Sections [90.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=90.003)(a)(2)(A), (B), (E), and (F) and [90.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=90.003)(b) or Sections [90.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=90.004)(a)(1), (2), and (4) and [90.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=90.004)(e); and
    
    (B)  verifies that:
    
    (i)  the physician making the report has a physician-patient relationship with the exposed person;
    
    (ii)  pulmonary function testing has been performed on the exposed person and the physician making the report has interpreted the pulmonary function testing;
    
    (iii)  the physician making the report has concluded, to a reasonable degree of medical probability, that the exposed person has radiographic, pathologic, or computed tomography evidence establishing bilateral pleural disease or bilateral parenchymal disease caused by exposure to asbestos or silica; and
    
    (iv)  the physician has concluded that the exposed person has asbestos-related or silica-related physical impairment comparable to the impairment the exposed person would have had if the exposed person met the criteria set forth in Section [90.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=90.003) or [90.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=90.004); and
    
    (2)  the MDL pretrial court shall determine whether:
    
    (A)  the report and medical opinions offered by the claimant are reliable and credible;
    
    (B)  due to unique or extraordinary physical or medical characteristics of the exposed person, the medical criteria set forth in Sections [90.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=90.003) and [90.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=90.004) do not adequately assess the exposed person's physical impairment caused by exposure to asbestos or silica; and
    
    (C)  the claimant has produced sufficient credible evidence for a finder of fact to reasonably find that the exposed person is physically impaired as the result of exposure to asbestos or silica to a degree comparable to the impairment the exposed person would have had if the exposed person met the criteria set forth in Section [90.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=90.003) or [90.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=90.004).
    
    (g)  A court's determination under Subsection (f) shall be made after conducting an evidentiary hearing at which the claimant and any defendant to the action may offer supporting or controverting evidence.  The parties shall be permitted a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery before the evidentiary hearing.
    
    (h)  The court shall state its findings under Subsection (f)(2) in writing and shall address in its findings:
    
    (1)  the unique or extraordinary physical or medical characteristics of the exposed person that justify the application of this section; and
    
    (2)  the reasons the criteria set forth in Sections [90.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=90.003) and [90.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=90.004) do not adequately assess the exposed person's physical impairment caused by exposure to asbestos or silica.
    
    (i)  Any findings made by a court under Subsection (f) are not admissible for any purpose at a trial on the merits.
    
    (j)  Subsections (d)(2) and (e)-(i) apply only in exceptional and limited circumstances in which the exposed person does not satisfy the medical criteria of Section [90.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=90.003) or [90.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=90.004) but can demonstrate meaningful asbestos-related or silica-related physical impairment that satisfies the requirements of Subsection (f).  Subsections (d)(2) and (e)-(i) have limited application and shall not be used to negate the requirements of this chapter.
    
    (k)  On or before September 1, 2010, each MDL pretrial court having jurisdiction over cases to which this chapter applies shall deliver a report to the governor, lieutenant governor, and the speaker of the house of representatives stating:
    
    (1)  the number of cases on the court's multidistrict litigation docket as of August 1, 2010;
    
    (2)  the number of cases on the court's multidistrict litigation docket as of August 1, 2010, that do not meet the criteria of Section [90.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=90.003) or [90.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=90.004), to the extent known;
    
    (3)  the court's evaluation of the effectiveness of the medical criteria established by Sections [90.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=90.003) and [90.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=90.004);
    
    (4)  the court's recommendation, if any, as to how medical criteria should be applied to the cases on the court's multidistrict litigation docket as of August 1, 2010; and
    
    (5)  any other information regarding the administration of cases in the MDL pretrial courts that the court deems appropriate.
    
    (l)  A dismissal under Subsection (d-1) is without prejudice to the claimant's right to file a subsequent action seeking damages arising from an asbestos-related injury or a silica-related injury.
    
    (m)  This chapter and Section [16.0031](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=16.0031) apply to a subsequent action for an asbestos-related injury or a silica-related injury filed by a claimant whose action was dismissed under Subsection (d-1) or by a claimant in an action described by Subsection (d) who voluntarily dismissed the action under Section [90.008](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=90.008).
    
    (n)  If a claimant subsequently refiles an action for an asbestos-related injury or a silica-related injury that was dismissed under Subsection (d-1), the refiled action is treated for purposes of determining the applicable law as if that claimant's action had never been dismissed but, instead, had remained pending until the claimant served a report that complied with Section [90.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=90.003), Section [90.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=90.004), or Subsection (f).
    
    (o)  A claimant whose action was dismissed under Subsection (d-1) may serve the petition and citation for any subsequently filed action for an asbestos-related or silica-related injury by certified mail, return receipt requested, or other method approved by the MDL pretrial court that is likely to accomplish service in a cost-effective manner, on a person who was a defendant in the dismissed action.

    (2)  "Trust claim" means any filing with or claim against an asbestos or silica trust seeking recovery of compensation or damages for or arising from the asbestos- or silica-related injury of an exposed person.
    
    (3)  "Trust claim material" means documentation filed as part of or in connection with a trust claim, including:

    (2)  served the notice of, and trust claim material relating to, those trust claims in accordance with Section [90.053](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=90.053).
    
    (b)  If a claimant received compensation from an asbestos or silica trust for an injury that also gave rise to a judgment against a defendant for the same injury and the claimant failed to serve the relevant notice and trust claim material as required by Section [90.053](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=90.053), the trial court, on a defendant's or judgment debtor's motion and after reasonable notice to the parties, may impose an appropriate sanction, including setting aside the judgment and ordering a new trial.
    
    (c)  This section may not be construed to require payment of a trust claim by an asbestos or silica trust before the MDL pretrial court remands the action for trial or before a judgment is rendered in the action.
