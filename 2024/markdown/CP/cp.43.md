    (b)  A surety who pays on a judgment as described by Subsection (a) is subrogated to all of the judgment creditor's rights under the judgment.  A subrogated surety is entitled to execution on the judgment against:

    (c)  A subrogated surety seeking execution on the judgment under Subsection (b) shall apply for execution to the clerk or court.  The execution shall be levied, collected, and returned as in other cases.
