    Sec. 52.006.  AMOUNT OF SECURITY FOR MONEY JUDGMENT.  (a)  Subject to Subsection (b), when a judgment is for money, the amount of security must equal the sum of:
    
    (1)  the amount of compensatory damages awarded in the judgment;
    
    (2)  interest for the estimated duration of the appeal;  and
    
    (3)  costs awarded in the judgment.
    
    (b)  Notwithstanding any other law or rule of court, when a judgment is for money, the amount of security must not exceed the lesser of:
    
    (1)  50 percent of the judgment debtor's net worth;  or
    
    (2)  $25 million.
    
    (c)  On a showing by the judgment debtor that the judgment debtor is likely to suffer substantial economic harm if required to post security in an amount required under Subsection (a) or (b), the trial court shall lower the amount of the security to an amount that will not cause the judgment debtor substantial economic harm.
    
    (d)  An appellate court may review the amount of security as allowed under Rule 24, Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure, except that when a judgment is for money, the appellate court may not modify the amount of security to exceed the amount allowed under this section.
    
    (e)  Nothing in this section prevents a trial court from enjoining the judgment debtor from dissipating or transferring assets to avoid satisfaction of the judgment, but the trial court may not make any order that interferes with the judgment debtor's use, transfer, conveyance, or dissipation of assets in the normal course of business.

    (c)  During an appeal, the judgment debtor shall continue to manage, use, and receive earnings from interests in real or personal property in the normal course of business.
    
    (d)  If an appellate court reduces the amount of the judgment that the trial court used to set security, the judgment debtor is entitled, pending appeal of the judgment to a court of last resort, to a redetermination of the amount of security required to suspend enforcement of a judgment under Section [52.006](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=52.006) or under Rule 24, Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure.
