    Sec. 172.082.  DETERMINATION OF JURISDICTION OF ARBITRATION TRIBUNAL.  (a)  The arbitration tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction, including an objection with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement.  For that purpose, an arbitration clause that is part of a contract is an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract.  A decision by the tribunal that the contract is void does not make the arbitration clause invalid.
    
    (b)  A party may not plead that the arbitration tribunal does not have jurisdiction after the submission of the statement of defense.  A party is not precluded from pleading because the party has appointed or participated in the appointment of an arbitrator.
    
    (c)  A party may plead that the arbitration tribunal is exceeding the scope of its authority only when the matter alleged to be beyond the scope of its authority is raised during the arbitration.
    
    (d)  The arbitration tribunal may allow a plea after the period described by Subsection (b) or (c) if the tribunal considers the delay justified.
    
    (e)  The arbitration tribunal may rule on a plea described by Subsection (b), (c), or (d) as a preliminary question or in an award on the merits.
    
    (f)  If the arbitration tribunal rules as a preliminary question that it has jurisdiction, a party waives objection to the ruling unless the party, not later than the 30th day after the date the party receives notice of that ruling, requests the district court of the county in which the place of arbitration is located to decide the matter.  The decision of the court is not subject to appeal.
    
    (g)  While a request under Subsection (f) is pending before the court, the arbitration tribunal may continue the arbitration and make an award.
