    (1)  a motor vehicle liability insurance policy covering the vehicle that satisfies Subchapter D or a photocopy of the policy;
    
    (2)  a standard proof of motor vehicle liability insurance form prescribed by the Texas Department of Insurance under Section [601.081](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=601.081) and issued by a liability insurer for the motor vehicle;
    
    (2-a)  an image displayed on a wireless communication device that includes the information required by Section [601.081](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=601.081) as provided by a liability insurer;

    Sec. 601.121.  SURETY BOND.  (a)  A person may establish financial responsibility by filing with the department a bond:
    
    (1)  with at least two individual sureties, each of whom owns real property in this state that is not exempt from execution under the constitution or laws of this state;
    
    (2)  conditioned for payment in the amounts and under the same circumstances as required under a motor vehicle liability insurance policy;
    
    (3)  that is not cancelable before the sixth day after the date the department receives written notice of the cancellation;
    
    (4)  accompanied by the fee required by Subsection (e);  and
    
    (5)  approved by the department.
    
    (b)  The real property required by Subsection (a)(1) must be described in the bond approved by a judge of a court of record.  The assessor-collector of the county in which the property is located must certify the property as free of any tax lien.  The sureties in combination must have equity in the property in an amount equal to at least twice the amount of the bond.
    
    (c)  The bond is a lien in favor of the state on the real property described in the bond.  The lien exists in favor of a person who holds a final judgment against the person who filed the bond.
    
    (d)  On filing of a bond, the department shall issue to the person who filed the bond a certificate of compliance with this section.
    
    (e)  The department shall file notice of the bond in the office of the county clerk of the county in which the real property is located.  The notice must include a description of the property described in the bond.  The county clerk or the county clerk's deputy, on receipt of the notice, shall acknowledge the notice and record it in the lien records.  The recording of the notice is notice in accordance with statutes governing the recordation of a lien on real property.
    
    (f)  If a judgment rendered against the person who files a bond under this section is not satisfied before the 61st day after the date the judgment becomes final, the judgment creditor, for the judgment creditor's own use and benefit and at the judgment creditor's expense, may bring an action in the name of the state against the sureties on the bond, including an action to foreclose a lien on the real property of a surety.  The foreclosure action must be brought in the same manner as, and is subject to the law applicable to, an action to foreclose a mortgage on real property.
    
    (g)  Cancellation of a bond filed under this section does not prevent recovery for a right or cause of action arising before the date of the cancellation.

    (d)  The comptroller shall hold a deposit made under this section to satisfy, in accordance with this chapter, an execution on a judgment issued against the person making the deposit for damages that:

    (2)  are for:
    
    (A)  bodily injury to or death of any person, including damages for care and loss of services;  or
    
    (B)  damage to or destruction of property, including the loss of use of the property.

    (d)  The department for cause may cancel a certificate of self-insurance after a hearing.   Cause includes failure to pay a judgment before the 31st day after the date the judgment becomes final.
