    (c)  The court shall exclude real property from the district if:
    
    (1)  the retention of the real property in the district's taxing jurisdiction would:
    
    (A)  be arbitrary and unnecessary to protect the public welfare;
    
    (B)  impair the value of the real property;  and
    
    (C)  arbitrarily impose a confiscatory burden on the real property;
    
    (2)  the retention of the real property in the district and the extension to it of the benefits, service, or protection of the district's roads would create an undue and uneconomical burden on the remainder of the district;  or
    
    (3)  the real property cannot be benefited by the district's proposed improvements.
    
    (d)  If, after considering the engineering information and other evidence presented at the hearing, the commissioners court determines that a ground for exclusion of the real property exists, the court shall enter an order:
    
    (1)  excluding the real property from the road district;  and
    
    (2)  redefining the boundaries of the district.

The petition must describe the real property by:
    
    (1)  metes and bounds;  or
    
    (2)  lot and block number if there is a recorded plat of the real property.
    
    (b)  Before the real property may be annexed to the road district, each petitioner must agree to:
    
    (1)  assume the petitioner's share of:

    (d)  The commissioners court may annex the real property described by the petition to the district if the court determines that:

    (f)  If no qualified voter resides on the real property proposed to be annexed to the district, the commissioners court may order the annexation of the real property without further proceedings.
    
    (g)  If a qualified voter resides on the real property to be added and there are any outstanding bonds, notes, or other obligations of the district that are payable from taxes, the commissioners court shall order an election to be held in the district, including the real property to be annexed to the district, on the question of the assumption by the real property to be annexed of the district's outstanding and approved but unissued bonds, notes, or other obligations and of the taxes imposed to pay those obligations.  Notice of the election shall be given and the election shall be held as provided by law for a bond election in the district.
    
    (h)  The order annexing the real property to the district shall provide that the annexation does not take effect unless a majority of the votes cast at the election held under Subsection (g) favor the assumption of the district's outstanding bonds, notes, and other obligations and the imposition of a tax to pay those obligations.

    (1)  owners of real property the taxable value of which is a majority of the taxable value of real property in the defined area according to the county tax roll;  or
    
    (2)  at least 50 property owners in the defined area if there are more than 50 property owners in the defined area.
    
    (b)  The commissioners court shall give notice of the hearing in the manner required for notice of a hearing on creation of a road district.
    
    (c)  If after the hearing the commissioners court finds that annexation of the defined area to the district is feasible and practical and would benefit the area and the district, the court may annex the area to the district.  The order annexing the area to the district is not required to include all of the real property described by a petition requesting the annexation if the court finds that a modification is necessary or desirable.
    
    (d)  The annexed area is subject to any bonds, notes, or other obligations issued or taxes imposed before the area was annexed to the district.
    
    (e)  The commissioners court shall, in the order annexing the area to the district, order an election to be held in the district, including the area to be annexed, on the questions whether the annexed area should assume:
    
    (1)  the bonds, notes, or other obligations issued or taxes imposed by the district before the area was annexed to the district;  and
    
    (2)  its part of the bonds of the district payable in whole or part from taxes that have been approved by the voters but have not been issued, and the imposition of the district's ad valorem tax on the taxable property in the annexed area for the payment of the bonds.

    (g)  Notice of an election held under this section shall be given and the election shall be held in the manner provided by law for a bond election in the district.
    
    (h)  If the majority of the votes received in the election favor the assumptions proposed under Subsection (e), the district may issue its approved but unissued bonds even though the boundaries of the district have been changed by the annexation since the original election approving the bonds.
    
    (i)  The commissioners court shall provide in its order annexing an area to the district that the annexation does not take effect unless the voters approve the assumptions proposed under Subsection (e).
    
    (j)  The commissioners court may provide in its order annexing an area to the district that the annexation does not take effect unless the voters approve an issuance of bonds proposed under Subsection (f).
