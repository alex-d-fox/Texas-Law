    (b)  If a citation is issued under this section, the commissioners court may assess an administrative penalty against the person cited.
    
    (c)  The commissioners court may assess the administrative penalty in an amount not to exceed $100 for each day the violation exists.  In determining the amount of the penalty, the commissioners court shall consider the seriousness of the violation.
    
    (d)  If, after examination of a possible violation and the facts relating to that possible violation, the commissioners court determines that a violation has occurred, the commissioners court shall issue a preliminary report that states the facts on which the conclusion is based, the fact that an administrative penalty is to be imposed, and the amount to be assessed.  Not later than the 10th day after the date on which the commissioners court issues the preliminary report, the commissioners court shall send a copy of the report to the person charged with the violation, together with a statement of the right of the person to a hearing relating to the alleged violation and the amount of the penalty.
    
    (e)  Not later than the 20th day after the date on which the report is sent, the person charged either may make a written request to the county judge or the judge's representative for a hearing or may remit the amount of the administrative penalty to the commissioners court.  Failure either to request a hearing or to remit the amount of the administrative penalty within the time provided by this subsection results in a waiver of a right to a hearing under this section.  If the person charged requests a hearing, the county judge or the judge's representative shall conduct the hearing in the manner provided for a contested case hearing under Chapter [2001](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code, as if the commissioners court were a state agency under that law.  If it is determined after hearing that the person has committed the alleged violation, the county judge or the judge's representative shall give written notice to the person of the findings established by the hearing and the amount of the penalty, and the commissioners court shall enter an order requiring the person to pay the penalty.  Not later than the 30th day after the date on which the notice is received, the person charged shall pay the administrative penalty in full.
    
    (f)  The person charged is entitled to an appeal by trial de novo in district court on the issue of the amount of the penalty or the fact of the violation.  If, after judicial review, it is determined that no violation occurred or that the amount of the penalty should be reduced, the commissioners court shall remit any appropriate amount to the person charged with the violation not later than the 30th day after the date on which the judicial determination becomes final.
    
    (g)  An administrative penalty recovered under this section shall be deposited in the county treasury to the credit of the general fund.
