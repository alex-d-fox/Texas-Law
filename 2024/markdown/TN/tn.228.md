    (b)  The county is the entity with the primary responsibility for the financing, construction, and operation of a toll project located in the county.  A county may develop, construct, and operate a project described in Subsection (a) at any time, regardless of whether it receives a first option notice from the commission or the department under Subsection (e).
    
    (b-1)  Consistent with federal law, the department shall assist the county in the financing, construction, and operation of a toll project in the county by allowing the county to use state highway right-of-way owned by the department and to access the state highway system.  The commission or the department may not require the county to pay for the use of the right-of-way or access, except to reimburse the department as provided by this subsection.  The county shall pay an amount to reimburse the department for the department's actual costs to acquire the right-of-way.  If the department cannot determine that amount, the amount shall be determined based on the average historical right-of-way acquisition values for right-of-way located in proximity to the project on the date of original acquisition of the right-of-way.  Money received by the department under this subsection shall be deposited in the state highway fund and used in the department district in which the project is located.
    
    (c)  The department and the county must enter into an agreement that includes reasonable terms to accommodate the use of the right-of-way by the county and to protect the interests of the commission and the department in the use of the right-of-way for operations of the department, including public safety and congestion mitigation on the right-of-way.
    
    (d)  Subsection (b) does not limit the authority of the commission or the department to participate in the cost of acquiring, constructing, maintaining, or operating a project of the county under Chapter [284](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=284).
    
    (e)  Before the department may enter into a contract for the financing, construction, or operation of a proposed or existing toll project any part of which is located in the county, the commission or department shall provide the county the first option to finance, construct, or operate, as applicable, the portion of the toll project located in the county:
    
    (1)  on terms agreeable to the county; and
    
    (2)  in a manner determined by the county to be consistent with the practices and procedures by which the county finances, constructs, or operates a project.
    
    (f)  A county's right to exercise the first option under Subsection (e) is effective for six months after the date of the receipt by the county of written notice from the commission or the department meeting the requirements of Subsection (e) and describing in reasonable detail the location of the toll project, a projected cost estimate, sources and uses of funds, and a construction schedule.  If a county exercises the first option with respect to a toll project, the county must enter into one or more contracts for the financing, construction, or operation of the toll project within two years after the date on which all environmental requirements necessary for the development of the project are secured and all legal challenges to development are concluded.  A contract may include agreements for design of the project, acquisition of right-of-way, and utility relocation.  If the county does not enter into a contract during the two-year period, the commission or the department may enter into a contract for the financing, construction, or operation of the toll project with a different entity.
    
    (g)  An agreement entered into by the county and the department in connection with a project under Chapter [284](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=284) that is financed, constructed, or operated by the county and that is on or directly connected to a highway in the state highway system does not create a joint enterprise for liability purposes.
    
    (h)  If the county approves, the commission may remove any right-of-way to be used by a county under this section from the state highway system.  If the right-of-way used by a county under this section remains part of the state highway system, the county must comply with department design and construction standards.
    
    (i)  Notwithstanding an action of a county taken under this section, the commission or department may take any action that is necessary in its reasonable judgment to comply with any federal requirement to enable this state to receive federal-aid highway funds.
    
    (j)  Notwithstanding any other law, the commission and the department are not liable for any damages that result from a county's use of state highway right-of-way or access to the state highway system under this section, regardless of the legal theory, statute, or cause of action under which liability is asserted.

    Sec. 228.102.  ISSUANCE OF BONDS.  (a)  The commission by order may authorize the issuance of toll revenue bonds to pay all or part of the cost of a toll project or system.  The proceeds of a bond issue may be used solely for the payment of the project or system for which the bonds were issued and may not be divided between or among two or more projects.  Each project is a separate undertaking, the cost of which shall be determined separately.
    
    (b)  As determined in the order authorizing the issuance, the bonds of each issue shall:
    
    (1)  be dated;
    
    (2)  bear interest at the rate or rates provided by the order and beginning on the dates provided by the order and as authorized by law, or bear no interest;
    
    (3)  mature at the time or times provided by the order, not exceeding 40 years from their date or dates; and
    
    (4)  be made redeemable before maturity, at the price or prices and under the terms provided by the order.

    (d)  The proceeds of each bond issue shall be disbursed in the manner and under the restrictions, if any, the commission provides in the order authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust agreement securing the bonds.
    
    (e)  If the proceeds of a bond issue are less than the toll project or system cost, additional bonds may be issued in the same manner to pay the costs of a project or system.  Unless otherwise provided in the order authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust agreement securing the bonds, the additional bonds are on a parity with and are payable, without preference or priority, from the same fund as the bonds first issued.  In addition, the commission may issue bonds for a project or system secured by a lien on the revenue of the project or system subordinate to the lien on the revenue securing other bonds issued for the project or system.
    
    (f)  If the proceeds of a bond issue exceed the cost of the toll project or system for which the bonds were issued, the surplus shall be segregated from the other money of the commission and used only for the purposes specified in the order authorizing the issuance.
