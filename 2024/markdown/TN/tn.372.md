    Sec. 372.105.  NONPAYMENT BY VEHICLES NOT REGISTERED IN THIS STATE.  (a)  A toll project entity may, in lieu of mailing a written notice of nonpayment, serve with a written notice of nonpayment in person an owner of a vehicle that is not registered in this state, including the owner of a vehicle registered in another state of the United States, the United Mexican States, a state of the United Mexican States, or another country or territory.  A notice of nonpayment may also be served by an employee of a governmental entity operating an international bridge at the time a vehicle with a record of nonpayment seeks to enter or leave this state.
    
    (b)  Each written notice of nonpayment issued under Subsection (a) shall include a warning that the failure to pay the amounts in the notice may result in the toll project entity's exercise of the habitual violator remedies under this subchapter.
    
    (c)  An owner who is served a written notice of nonpayment under Subsection (a) and fails to pay the proper toll and administrative fee within the time specified in the notice commits an offense.  Each failure to pay a toll or administrative fee under this subsection is a separate offense.
    
    (d)  An offense under Subsection (c) is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed $250.  The court in which an owner is convicted of an offense under this section may also collect the proper toll and administrative fee and forward the toll and fee to the toll project entity.
    
    (e)  It is a defense to prosecution under Subsection (c) that the owner of the vehicle is a lessor of the vehicle and not later than the 30th day after the date the notice of nonpayment is served under Subsection (a) provides to the toll project entity proof that meets applicable toll project entity law establishing that the vehicle was leased to another person at the time of the nonpayment.
    
    (f)  It is a defense to prosecution under Subsection (c) that the vehicle in question was stolen before the failure to pay the proper toll occurred and was not recovered by the time of the failure to pay, but only if the theft was reported to the appropriate law enforcement authority before the earlier of:
    
    (1)  the occurrence of the failure to pay; or

    Sec. 372.106.  HABITUAL VIOLATOR.  (a)  For purposes of this subchapter, a habitual violator is a registered owner of a vehicle who a toll project entity determines:
    
    (1)  was issued at least two written notices of nonpayment that contained:
    
    (A)  in the aggregate, 100 or more events of nonpayment within a period of one year, not including events of nonpayment for which:
    
    (i)  the registered owner has provided to the toll project entity information establishing that the vehicle was subject to a lease at the time of the nonpayment, as provided by applicable toll project entity law; or
    
    (ii)  a defense of theft at the time of the nonpayment has been established as provided by applicable toll project entity law; and
    
    (B)  a warning that the failure to pay the amounts specified in the notices may result in the toll project entity's exercise of habitual violator remedies; and
    
    (2)  has not paid in full the total amount due for tolls and administrative fees under those notices.
    
    (b)  If the toll project entity makes a determination under Subsection (a), the toll project entity shall give written notice to the person at:

    (c)  The notice must:
    
    (1)  be sent by first class mail and is presumed received on the fifth day after the date the notice is mailed; and
    
    (2)  state:

    (d)  The issues that must be proven at the hearing by a preponderance of the evidence are:
    
    (1)  whether the registered owner was issued at least two written notices of nonpayment for an aggregate of 100 or more events of nonpayment within a period of one year, not including events of nonpayment for which:
    
    (A)  the registered owner has provided to the toll project entity information establishing that the vehicle was subject to a lease at the time of the nonpayment, as provided by applicable toll project entity law; or
    
    (B)  a defense of theft at the time of the nonpayment has been established as provided by applicable toll project entity law; and
    
    (2)  whether the total amount due for tolls and administrative fees specified in those notices was not paid in full by the dates specified in the notices and remains not fully paid.
    
    (e)  Proof under Subsection (d) may be by oral testimony, documentary evidence, video surveillance, or any other reasonable evidence.
    
    (f)  If the justice of the peace finds in the affirmative on each issue in Subsection (d), the toll project entity's determination that the registered owner is a habitual violator is sustained and becomes final.  If the justice does not find in the affirmative on each issue in Subsection (d), the toll project entity shall rescind its determination that the registered owner is a habitual violator.  Rescission of the determination does not limit the toll project entity's authority to pursue collection of the outstanding tolls and administrative fees.
    
    (g)  A registered owner who requests a hearing and fails to appear without just cause waives the right to a hearing, and the toll project entity's determination is final and not subject to appeal.
    
    (h)  A justice of the peace court may adopt administrative hearings processes to expedite hearings conducted under this section.
