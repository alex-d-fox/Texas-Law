    (1)  contain an estimate of the cost of the improvement;
    
    (2)  list each lot or part of a lot abutting the street or alley to be improved and list the number and size of the lot, the number of the block in which the lot is located, the owner of the lot or a statement that the owner is unknown, and other information required by the governing body;  and
    
    (3)  state, opposite a lot's listing, one-third the estimated cost of the improvement of the street or alley abutting the lot.
    
    (e)  On the acceptance and approval of the report, the governing body shall impose the assessment as taxes.  After the assessment is imposed, the individual or committee that prepared the report shall give, as may be required by ordinance, notice of the time in which the payment of the assessment is due and shall begin to collect the payment.
    
    (f)  The assessment is a lien on the land until it is paid.  After an assessment on the land becomes delinquent, the individual or committee that prepared the report on the assessments may seize any part of the land that is sufficient to pay the assessment.  The individual or committee shall sell the seized land if the assessment is not paid before the day of the sale.  The municipality shall give the same notice of the sale that is required to be given in other sales to collect delinquent taxes.  The sale is subject to the same ordinance provisions that govern the name, circumstances, and conditions under which a sale of land may be made and the extent to which a sale may be made to collect delinquent taxes owed the municipality.  The individual or committee shall execute a deed to the purchaser at the sale.  The deed used in the sale is subject to another statute that governs a deed prepared by an assessor or collector of taxes for a general-law municipality.
    
    (g)  The governing body may initiate a suit in the municipality's corporate name to recover from a landowner an assessment.
    
    (h)  The governing body may adopt resolutions, ordinances, or regulations necessary to carry out the authority granted by this section.

    (b)  If necessary to collect the cost of the construction, the municipality shall sell the lot, or the part of the lot or block, in the manner the governing body of the municipality by ordinance provides.  The municipality may keep an amount of the sale proceeds that covers the cost of the construction and the cost of collection.  The municipality shall pay to the owner the balance of the sale proceeds.
    
    (c)  The sale of the lot, or the part of the lot or block, under this section conveys a good title to the purchaser.
