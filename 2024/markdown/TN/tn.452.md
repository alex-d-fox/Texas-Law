    (b)  An authority's operating cost per passenger is computed by dividing the authority's annual operating cost by the passenger trips for the same period.
    
    (c)  The sales and use tax receipts per passenger are computed by dividing the annual receipts from authority sales and use taxes by passenger trips for the same period.
    
    (c-1)  The subsidy per passenger is computed by subtracting annual operating revenues from annual operating costs and dividing that amount by the total number of passengers for the same period.
    
    (d)  The operating cost per revenue hour is computed by dividing the annual operating cost by the total of scheduled hours that authority revenue vehicles are in revenue service for the same period.

    (g)  The number of passengers per hour is computed by dividing the total number of annual passengers by the total number of revenue vehicle hours for the same period.
    
    (h)  On-time performance is computed by determining an annual percentage of revenue vehicle trips of revenue vehicles that depart from selected locations at a time not earlier than the published departure time and not later than five minutes after that published time.  On-time performance is computed only for fixed route revenue service.
    
    (i)  The number of collisions per 100,000 miles is computed by multiplying the annual number of collisions by 100,000 and dividing the product by the number of miles for all service, including charter and nonrevenue service for the same period.  In this subsection, "collision" includes:
    
    (1)  a collision that involves an authority's revenue vehicle, other than a lawfully parked revenue vehicle, and results in property damage, injury, or death; and
    
    (2)  an operating incident resulting in the injury or death of a person on board or boarding or alighting from an authority's revenue vehicle.

In this subsection, "mechanical service call" means an interruption in revenue service that is caused by revenue vehicle equipment failure that requires assistance from a person other than the vehicle operator before the vehicle can be operated normally.
    
    (k)  In this section:

    (5)  the amount necessary for the full and timely payment of the obligations of the authority, to avoid a default or impairment of those obligations, including contingent liabilities.
    
    (c)  The apportioned share of a unit's obligation or assets is the amount of the obligation or assets times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of inhabitants of the withdrawing unit of election and the denominator of which is the number of inhabitants of the authority, including the number of inhabitants of the unit.
