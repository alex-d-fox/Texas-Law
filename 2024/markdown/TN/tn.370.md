    (c)  The authority shall use its best efforts to provide an affected utility with plans and drawings of the project that are sufficient to enable the utility to develop plans for, and determine the cost of, the necessary relocation of a public utility facility.

    (g)  The 90-day period under Subsection (e) may be extended:
    
    (1)  by mutual agreement between the authority and the utility;  or

    (1)  a material action or inaction of the authority;
    
    (2)  an inability of the public utility facility owner or operator to obtain necessary line clearances to perform the removal or relocation;  or
    
    (3)  conditions beyond the reasonable control of the owner or operator of the facility, including:
    
    (A)  an act of God;  or
    
    (B)  a labor shortage or strike.
    
    (j)  The owner or operator of a public utility facility relocated or removed under Subsection (f) shall reimburse the authority for the expenses the authority reasonably incurred for the relocation or removal of the facility, less any costs that would have been payable to the owner or operator under Subsection (h) had the owner or operator relocated or removed the facility, except that the owner or operator is not required to reimburse the authority if the failure of the owner or operator to timely relocate or remove the facility was the result of circumstances beyond the control of the owner or operator.

    Sec. 370.177.  FAILURE OR REFUSAL TO PAY TURNPIKE PROJECT TOLL;  OFFENSE;  ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY.  (a)  Except as provided by Subsection (a-1), the operator of a vehicle, other than an authorized emergency vehicle as defined by Section [541.201](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=541.201), that is driven or towed through a toll collection facility of a turnpike project shall pay the proper toll.  The operator of a vehicle who drives or tows a vehicle through a toll collection facility and does not pay the proper toll commits an offense.  An offense under this subsection is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed $250.  The exemption from payment of a toll for an authorized emergency vehicle applies regardless of whether the vehicle is:
    
    (1)  responding to an emergency;
    
    (2)  displaying a flashing light; or
    
    (3)  marked as an emergency vehicle.
    
    (a-1)  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), the board may waive the requirement of the payment of a toll or may authorize the payment of a reduced toll for any vehicle or class of vehicles.
    
    (b)  In the event of nonpayment of the proper toll as required by Subsection (a), on issuance of a written notice of nonpayment, the registered owner of the nonpaying vehicle is liable for the payment of both the proper toll and an administrative fee.
    
    (c)  The authority may impose and collect the administrative fee to recover the cost of collecting the unpaid toll, not to exceed $100.  The authority shall send a written notice of nonpayment to the registered owner of the vehicle at that owner's address as shown in the vehicle registration records of the department by first class mail not later than the 30th day after the date of the alleged failure to pay and may require payment not sooner than the 30th day after the date the notice was mailed.  The registered owner shall pay a separate toll and administrative fee for each event of nonpayment under Subsection (a).
    
    (d)  The registered owner of a vehicle for which the proper toll was not paid who is mailed a written notice of nonpayment under Subsection (c) and fails to pay the proper toll and administrative fee within the time specified by the notice of nonpayment commits an offense.  Each failure to pay a toll or administrative fee under this subsection is a separate offense.
    
    (e)  It is an exception to the application of Subsection (b) or (d) that the registered owner of the vehicle is a lessor of the vehicle and not later than the 30th day after the date the notice of nonpayment is mailed provides to the authority:
    
    (1)  a copy of the rental, lease, or other contract document covering the vehicle on the date of the nonpayment under Subsection (a), with the name and address of the lessee clearly legible; or
    
    (2)  electronic data, other than a photocopy or scan of a rental or lease contract, that contains the information required under Sections [521.460](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=521.460)(c)(1), (2), and (3) covering the vehicle on the date of the nonpayment under Subsection (a).
    
    (e-1)  If the lessor provides the required information within the period prescribed under Subsection (e), the authority may send a notice of nonpayment to the lessee at the address provided under Subsection (e) by first class mail before the 30th day after the date of receipt of the required information from the lessor.  The lessee of the vehicle for which the proper toll was not paid who is mailed a written notice of nonpayment under this subsection and fails to pay the proper toll and administrative fee within the time specified by the notice of nonpayment commits an offense.  The lessee shall pay a separate toll and administrative fee for each event of nonpayment.  Each failure to pay a toll or administrative fee under this subsection is a separate offense.
    
    (f)  It is an exception to the application of Subsection (b) or (d) that the registered owner of the vehicle transferred ownership of the vehicle to another person before the event of nonpayment under Subsection (a) occurred, submitted written notice of the transfer to the department in accordance with Section [501.147](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=501.147), and before the 30th day after the date the notice of nonpayment is mailed, provides to the authority the name and address of the person to whom the vehicle was transferred.  If the former owner of the vehicle provides the required information within the period prescribed, the authority may send a notice of nonpayment to the person to whom ownership of the vehicle was transferred at the address provided by the former owner by first class mail before the 30th day after the date of receipt of the required information from the former owner.  The subsequent owner of the vehicle for which the proper toll was not paid who is mailed a written notice of nonpayment under this subsection and fails to pay the proper toll and administrative fee within the time specified by the notice of nonpayment commits an offense.  The subsequent owner shall pay a separate toll and administrative fee for each event of nonpayment under Subsection (a).  Each failure to pay a toll or administrative fee under this subsection is a separate offense.
    
    (g)  An offense under Subsection (d), (e-1), or (f) is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed $250.
    
    (h)  The court in which a person is convicted of an offense under this section shall also collect the proper toll and administrative fee and forward the toll and fee to the authority.
    
    (i)  In the prosecution of an offense under this section, proof that the vehicle passed through a toll collection facility without payment of the proper toll together with proof that the defendant was the registered owner or the driver of the vehicle when the failure to pay occurred, establishes the nonpayment of the registered owner.  The proof may be by testimony of a peace officer or authority employee, video surveillance, or any other reasonable evidence, including:
    
    (1)  evidence obtained by automated enforcement technology that the authority determines is necessary, including automated enforcement technology described by Sections [228.058](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=228.058)(a) and (b); or
    
    (2)  a copy of the rental, lease, or other contract document or the electronic data provided to the authority under Subsection (e) that shows the defendant was the lessee of the vehicle when the underlying event of nonpayment occurred.
    
    (j)  It is a defense to prosecution under this section that the motor vehicle in question was stolen before the failure to pay the proper toll occurred and was not recovered by the time of the failure to pay, but only if the theft was reported to the appropriate law enforcement authority before the earlier of:
    
    (1)  the occurrence of the failure to pay;  or
    
    (2)  eight hours after the discovery of the theft.
    
    (k)  In this section, "registered owner" means the owner of a vehicle as shown on the vehicle registration records of the department or the analogous department or agency of another state or country.
    
    (l)  In addition to the other powers and duties provided by this chapter, with regard to its toll collection and enforcement powers for its turnpike projects or other toll projects developed, financed, constructed, and operated under an agreement with the authority or another entity, an authority has the same powers and duties as the department under Chapter [228](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=228), a county under Chapter [284](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=284), and a regional tollway authority under Chapter [366](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=366).

    (n)  As authorized under Section [322.008](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=322.008)(d)(2), Business & Commerce Code, an authority may provide an invoice or notice required under this section to be sent by first class mail instead as an electronic record:
    
    (1)  if the recipient of the information agrees to the transmission of the information as an electronic record; and
    
    (2)  on terms acceptable to the recipient.

    (d)  If six-year terms are permitted under the constitution of this state, one director appointed to the initial board of an authority by the commissioners court of a county shall be designated by the court to serve a term of two years and one director designated to serve a term of four years.  If six-year terms are not permitted under the constitution, one director appointed to the initial board of an authority by the commissioners court of a county shall be designated by the court to serve a term of one year and one director designated to serve a term of two years.

    (1)  the authority decides to issue a request for qualifications for a proposed project;  or
    
    (2)  the authority authorizes the further evaluation of an unsolicited proposal.
    
    (d)  A proposal submitted in response to a request published under Subsection (c) must contain, at a minimum, the information required by Subsections (b)(2) and (3).
    
    (e)  An authority may interview a private entity submitting an unsolicited proposal or responding to a request under Subsection (c).  The authority shall evaluate each proposal based on the criteria described in the notice.  The authority must qualify at least two private entities to submit detailed proposals for a project under Subsection (f) unless the authority does not receive more than one proposal or one response to a request under Subsection (c).
    
    (f)  An authority shall issue a request for detailed proposals from all private entities qualified under Subsection (e) if the authority proceeds with the further evaluation of a proposed project.  A request under this subsection may require additional information relating to:
    
    (1)  the private entity's qualifications and demonstrated technical competence;
    
    (2)  the feasibility of developing the project as proposed;
    
    (3)  detailed engineering or architectural designs;

    (1)  incorporation of aspects of other proposals for the purpose of achieving the overall best value for the authority;
    
    (2)  clarifications and minor adjustments in scheduling, cash flow, and similar items;  and
    
    (3)  matters that have arisen since the submission of the proposal.
    
    (j)  If at any point in discussions under Subsection (i), it appears to the authority that the highest ranking proposal will not provide the authority with the overall best value, the authority may enter into discussions with the private entity submitting the next-highest ranking proposal.
    
    (k)  An authority may withdraw a request for competing proposals and qualifications or a request for detailed proposals at any time.  The authority may then publish a new request for competing proposals and qualifications.

A stipulated amount must be stated in the request for proposals and may not exceed the value of any work product contained in the proposal that can, as determined by the authority, be used by the authority in the performance of its functions.  The use by the authority of any design element contained in an unsuccessful proposal is at the sole risk and discretion of the authority and does not confer liability on the recipient of the stipulated amount under this subsection.  After payment of the stipulated amount:
    
    (1)  the authority owns the exclusive rights to, and may make use of any work product contained in, the proposal, including the technologies, techniques, methods, processes, and information contained in the project design; and

    (b)  An authority may request in writing a transit provider to transfer the provider's transit system and taxing authority to the authority if the board determines that the traffic needs of the counties in which the authority operates could be most efficiently and economically met by the transfer.
    
    (c)  On receipt of a written request under Subsection (b), the governing body of the transit provider may authorize the authority to solicit public comment and conduct at least one public hearing on the proposed transfer in each unit of election in the transit provider's service area.  Notice of a hearing must be published in the Texas Register, one or more newspapers of general circulation in the transit provider's service area, and a newspaper, if any, published in the counties of the requesting authority.  The notice shall also solicit written comments on the proposed transfer.  The transit provider may participate fully with the authority in conducting a public hearing.
    
    (d)  A board may approve the acquisition of the transit provider if the governing body of the transit provider approves transfer of its operations to the authority and dissolution of the transit provider is approved in an election ordered under Subsection (e).  Before approving the acquisition, the board shall consider public comments received under Subsection (c).
    
    (e)  After considering public comments received under Subsection (c), the governing body of the transit provider may order an election to dissolve the transit provider and transfer all services, property, funds, assets, employees, debts, and obligations to the authority.  The governing body of the transit provider shall submit to the qualified voters in the units of election in the transit provider's service area a proposition that reads substantially as follows: "Shall (name of transit provider) be dissolved and its services, property, funds, assets, employees, debts, and obligations be transferred to (name of regional mobility authority)?"

    (g)  The governing body of the transit provider shall canvass the returns and declare the results of the election separately with respect to each unit of election.  If a majority of the votes received in a unit of election are in favor of the proposition, the proposition is approved in that unit of election.  The transit provider is dissolved and its services, property, funds, assets, employees, debts, and obligations are transferred to the authority only if the proposition is approved in every unit of election.  If the proposition is not approved in every unit of election, the proposition does not pass and the transit provider is not dissolved.
    
    (h)  A certified copy of the order or resolution recording the results of the election shall be filed with the department, the comptroller, and the governing body of each unit of election in the transit provider's service area.
