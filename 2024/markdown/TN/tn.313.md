    (1)  supply any deficiency in the assessment proceedings;

    Sec. 313.051.  NO LIEN ON EXEMPT PROPERTY;  LIABILITY OF OWNER.  (a)  This chapter does not authorize a lien against an interest in property that, at the time an improvement is ordered, is exempt from any lien created by an assessment for a street improvement.
    
    (b)  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), the owner of exempt property is personally liable for an assessment in connection with the property.
    
    (c)  The omission of an improvement fronting exempt property does not invalidate the lien or liability for an assessment made against nonexempt property.

The certificate may declare the lien on the property and the liability of the owner of the property regardless of whether the owner is correctly named.  The governing body may determine the terms of the certificate.
    
    (b)  A recital in a certificate that states substantially that the procedure for making the improvement was in compliance with law and that all prerequisites to creating the assessment lien on the property the certificate describes and to creating the personal liability of the property owner were performed is prima facie evidence of those matters.
    
    (c)  Subsection (b) applies to a recital in a certificate that evidences an assessment under Section [313.048](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=313.048) or [313.050](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=313.050).

    (b)  A change that substantially affects the nature or quality of an improvement may not be made unless the governing body determines, by a two-thirds vote, that it is impractical to proceed with the improvement.
    
    (c)  If a substantial change is made after a hearing has been ordered or held, the governing body, in the same manner and with the same effect as provided for an original notice and hearing, shall:

    (2)  order and hold a new hearing;  and

    (f)  If an improvement is abandoned, a municipality shall adopt an ordinance that has the effect of canceling:
    
    (1)  any assessment imposed for the abandoned improvement;  and
    
    (2)  all other proceedings relating to the abandoned improvement.

    Sec. 313.054.  ENFORCEMENT OF ASSESSMENT;  PRIORITY OF LIEN;  DEFENSES.  (a)  An assessment under this subchapter:
    
    (1)  is collectible with interest, expense of collection, and reasonable attorney's fees, if incurred;
    
    (2)  is a first and prior lien on the property on which the lien is created from the date the municipality orders the improvement;  and
    
    (3)  is superior to any other lien or claim other than a lien or claim for county, school district, or municipal ad valorem taxes.
    
    (b)  A lien against property or the personal liability of a property owner that arises from an assessment made under this subchapter may be enforced by:
    
    (1)  suit;  or
    
    (2)  sale of the property assessed in the manner provided by law for sale of property for municipal ad valorem taxes.
    
    (c)  In a suit on an assessment for which a certificate has been issued, it is sufficient to allege the substance of the recitals in the certificate and that the recitals are true.  Additional allegations about the assessment proceedings are not necessary in the suit.
