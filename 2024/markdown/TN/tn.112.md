(a)  In an action under Section [112.152](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=112.152), the employee's contributory negligence is not a bar to recovery but the fact finder shall reduce the employee's damages in proportion to the amount of contributory negligence attributable to the employee.
    
    (b)  An employee may not be found contributorily negligent in a case in which the railroad operator's violation of a statute enacted for the safety of employees contributed to the employee's injury or death.

(a)  The plea of assumed risk is not available as a bar to recovery of damages in a suit brought in a court in this state against a corporation, receiver, or other person operating a railroad, interurban railway, or street railway in this state for the recovery of damages for the death of or personal injury to an employee caused by the wrong or negligence of the railroad or railway operator.  An employee assumes the ordinary risk incident to the employee's employment but does not assume the risk resulting from any negligence of the employee's employer, regardless of whether the negligence is known to the employee.
    
    (b)  If in a suit described by Subsection (a) it is alleged and proven that the deceased or injured employee was negligent in continuing in the service of the railroad or railway operator in view of the risk, dangers, and hazards of which the employee knew or must necessarily have known, in the ordinary performance of the employee's duties, that fact does not bar the employee's recovery, but is considered contributory negligence.  If contributory negligence described by this subsection proximately caused or contributed to the cause of the death or injury, the damages recoverable by the employee or the employee's heirs or representatives shall be reduced only in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the employee.
    
    (c)  An employee of a railway company who is injured while engaged in the operation of a train in this state that is propelled by two or more engines is not considered to have assumed the risk of that injury if the injury is a result of the operation of two or more engines on the train rather than one.
    
    (d)  In an action against a railroad operator under Section [112.152](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=112.152), an employee may not be held to have assumed the risk of the employee's employment in a case in which the railroad operator's violation of a statute enacted for the safety of employees contributed to the employee's injury or death.
