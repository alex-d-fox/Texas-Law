    (e)  After the date has passed, according to department records, for successful completion of the educational program designed to rehabilitate persons who operated motor vehicles while intoxicated, the director shall revoke the license of a person who does not successfully complete the program or, if the person is a resident without a license to operate a motor vehicle in this state, shall issue an order prohibiting the person from obtaining a license.

    (g)  A revocation, suspension, or prohibition order under Subsection (e) or (f) remains in effect until the department receives notice of successful completion of the educational program.  The director shall promptly send notice of a revocation or prohibition order issued under Subsection (e) or (f) by:
    
    (1)  first class mail to the person at the person's most recent address as shown in the records of the department; or
    
    (2)  e-mail if the person has provided an e-mail address to the department and has elected to receive notice electronically.
    
    (g-1)  The notice provided under Subsection (g) must include the date of the revocation or prohibition order, the reason for the revocation or prohibition, and a statement that the person has the right to request in writing that a hearing be held on the revocation or prohibition.  Notice is considered received on the fifth day after the date the notice is sent. A revocation or prohibition under Subsection (e) or (f) takes effect on the 30th day after the date the notice is sent. The person may request a hearing not later than the 20th day after the date the notice is sent. If the department receives a request under this subsection, the department shall set the hearing for the earliest practical time and the revocation or prohibition does not take effect until resolution of the hearing.
    
    (h)  The hearing shall be held in a municipal or justice court in the county of the person's residence in the manner provided for a suspension hearing under Subchapter N.  The issues to be determined at the hearing are whether the person has successfully completed a required educational program and whether the period for completion of the program has passed.  If the presiding officer determines that the educational program has not been completed and the period for completion has passed, the officer shall confirm the revocation or prohibition and shall notify the department of that fact.  The director may not revoke or prohibit the license if the officer finds that the program has been completed, that, before the hearing, the court that originally imposed the requirement to attend an educational program has granted an extension that has not expired, or that the period for completion has not passed.  If the person or the person's agent fails to appear at the hearing, the department shall revoke the person's license until the department receives notice of successful completion of the educational program.
    
    (i)  On the date that a suspension order under Section [521.343](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=521.343)(c) is to expire, the period of suspension or the corresponding period in which the department is prohibited from issuing a license is automatically increased to two years unless the department receives notice of successful completion of the educational program as required by Article [42A.406](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=42A.406), Code of Criminal Procedure.  At the time a person is convicted of an offense under Section [49.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=49.04) or [49.045](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=49.045), Penal Code, the court shall warn the person of the effect of this subsection.  On the person's successful completion of the program, the person's instructor shall give notice to the department and to the community supervision and corrections department in the manner required by Article [42A.406](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=42A.406)(b), Code of Criminal Procedure.  If the department receives proof of completion after a period has been extended under this subsection, the department shall immediately end the suspension or prohibition.

    Sec. 521.347.  REPORTS;  RECOMMENDED SUSPENSION.  (a)  The court in which a person is convicted of an offense for which this chapter or Chapter [522](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=522) requires automatic suspension of the person's driver's license may require the person to surrender to the court each driver's license held by the person.  Not later than the 10th day after the date on which the license is surrendered to the court, the clerk of the court shall send to the department:
    
    (1)  the license;  and
    
    (2)  a record of the conviction that states whether the vehicle involved in the offense was a commercial motor vehicle as defined by Chapter [522](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=522) or was involved in the transport of hazardous materials.
    
    (b)  Each court with jurisdiction of an offense under this chapter or another law of this state regulating the operation of a motor vehicle on a highway shall send to the department a record of conviction of any person convicted in the court of such a violation.

    (c)  For purposes of this section, "conviction" means a final conviction.  A conviction is a final conviction regardless of whether any portion of the sentence for the conviction was suspended or probated but is not a final conviction if the defendant receives a deferred adjudication in the case or if the court defers final disposition of the case, unless the court subsequently proceeds with an adjudication of guilt and imposes a sentence on the defendant.  For purposes of this section, a final judgment of forfeiture of bail or collateral deposited to secure a defendant's appearance in court is a conviction if the forfeiture is not vacated.
