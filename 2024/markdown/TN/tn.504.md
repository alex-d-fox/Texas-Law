    Sec. 504.801.  CREATION OF NEW SPECIALTY LICENSE PLATES BY THE DEPARTMENT.  (a)  The department may create new specialty license plates on its own initiative or on receipt of an application from a potential sponsor.  A new specialty license plate created under this section must comply with each requirement of Section [504.702](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=504.702) unless the license is created by the department on its own initiative.  The department may permit a specialty license plate created under this section to be personalized.  The redesign of an existing specialty license plate at the request of a sponsor shall be treated like the issuance of a new specialty license plate.
    
    (b)  Any nonprofit entity may submit an application to the department to sponsor a new specialty license plate.  An application may nominate a state agency to receive funds derived from the issuance of the license plates.  The application may also identify uses to which those funds should be appropriated.
    
    (c)  The department shall design each new specialty license plate in consultation with the sponsor, if any, that applied for creation of that specialty license plate.  The department may refuse to create a new specialty license plate if the design might be offensive to any member of the public, if the nominated state agency does not consent to receipt of the funds derived from issuance of the license plate, if the uses identified for those funds might violate a statute or constitutional provision, or for any other reason established by rule.  At the request of the sponsor, distribution of the license plate may be limited by the department.
    
    (d)  The fee for issuance of license plates created under this subchapter before November 19, 2009, is $30 unless the department sets a higher fee.  This subsection does not apply to a specialty license plate marketed and sold by a private vendor at the request of the specialty license plate sponsor.
    
    (d-1)  The fee for issuance of license plates created under this subchapter on or after November 19, 2009, is the amount established under Section [504.851](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=504.851).
    
    (e)  For each fee collected for a license plate issued by the department under this section:
    
    (1)  $8 shall be used to reimburse the department for its administrative costs; and
    
    (2)  the remainder shall be deposited to the credit of:
    
    (A)  the specialty license plate fund, which is an account in the general revenue fund, if the sponsor nominated a state agency to receive the funds; or
    
    (B)  the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles fund if the sponsor did not nominate a state agency to receive the funds or if there is no sponsor.
    
    (f)  Subchapter [D](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=316.031), Chapter [316](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=316), Government Code, and Section [403.095](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=403.095), Government Code, do not apply to fees collected under this subchapter.
    
    (g)  The department may report to the legislature at any time concerning implementation of this section.  The report may include recommendations concerning the appropriations, by amount, state agency, and uses, that are necessary to implement the requests of sponsors.
    
    (h)  The department may vary the design of a license plate created under this section to accommodate or reflect its use on a motor vehicle other than a passenger car or light truck.
    
    (i)  The sponsor of a new specialty plate may not be a for-profit enterprise.
