    Sec. 501.076.  LIMITED POWER OF ATTORNEY.  (a)  An owner who has a contractual option to transfer ownership of a vehicle in full or partial satisfaction of the balance owed on the vehicle, as provided in Section [348.123](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=348.123)(b)(5), Finance Code, may execute a written limited power of attorney that authorizes an agent to complete and sign for the owner, and provide to the transferee, the form to transfer the title under Section [501.071](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=501.071) and the odometer disclosure under Section [501.072](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=501.072), and the other documents necessary to transfer title.
    
    (b)  The owner may execute the limited power of attorney at the time the owner enters the contract giving the owner the option to transfer the vehicle or at any time after that date.  The limited power of attorney may only be used if an owner elects to transfer the vehicle in full or partial satisfaction of the contract and may not be used by the holder of the contract as part of the holder's exercise of a remedy for a default by the owner under the contract.
    
    (c)  The person named as the agent in the limited power of attorney must meet the following requirements:
    
    (1)  the person may be a person who has been deputized to perform vehicle registration functions as authorized by rules adopted under Section [520.0071](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=520.0071), a licensed vehicle auction company holding a wholesale general distinguishing number under Section [503.022](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=503.022), a person who has a permit similar to one of the foregoing that is issued by the state in which the owner is located, or another person authorized by law to execute title documents in the state in which the owner executes the documents; and
    
    (2)  the person may not be the transferee or an employee of the transferee.  The person may not act as the agent of both the transferor and transferee in the transaction.  For the purposes of this section, a person is not the agent of both the transferor and transferee in a transaction unless the person has the authority to sign the documents pertaining to the transfer of title on behalf of both the transferor and the transferee.
    
    (d)  If a limited power of attorney is used under Subsection (a), the holder of the contract shall accompany the power of attorney with a written statement that the vehicle was returned at the election of the owner in full or partial satisfaction of the owner's obligations under the contract and not as the result of the exercise by the holder of the contract of its remedies for default.
    
    (e)  A signed and dated written odometer disclosure containing the information described in this subsection may be included on or with the power of attorney if the power of attorney is executed within 120 days before the date of the transfer and is accompanied by the conspicuous written notification described in this subsection.  If an odometer disclosure is not obtained in that manner, the transferee or agent or the person to whom the vehicle is delivered at the time of the transfer shall request an odometer disclosure as provided in this subsection.  Not more than 120 days before the transfer of the vehicle by the owner, the transferee or agent under the power of attorney or person receiving delivery of the vehicle shall in writing request the owner to provide a signed and dated written statement stating the odometer reading (not to include tenths of a mile) as of the date of the statement, and further stating words to the effect that either:  (i) to the best of the owner's knowledge, the odometer reading reflects the actual mileage of the vehicle;  (ii) the actual mileage has gone over the odometer's mechanical limits and the odometer reading reflects the amount of mileage in excess of the mechanical limits of the odometer, if the owner knows that to be the case;  or (iii) the odometer reading is not the actual mileage, if the owner knows that to be the case.  The statement may consist of a form in which the agent or transferee or person receiving the vehicle includes the identification of the vehicle and owner and which allows the owner to fill in the odometer reading and mark an applicable box to indicate which of condition (i), (ii), or (iii) is applicable and to date and sign the statement.  With the request for the owner's statement, the transferee or agent or person receiving the vehicle shall provide a written notification to the owner to the effect that the owner has a duty under law to state the odometer reading, state which of conditions (i), (ii), or (iii) is applicable, and sign, date, and return the statement and that failing to do so or providing false information may result in fines or imprisonment.  Unless the written notification is delivered to the owner at substantially the same time that the owner is delivering the signed and dated owner's statement, the written notification must also state a date by which the owner must provide this information and an address to which it may be delivered.  This written notification to the owner must be in bold letters, underlined, or otherwise conspicuous and may be in a separate document or included as part of a form to be used for the owner's statement or in another document relating to the potential transfer.  The transferee or agent or the person receiving delivery of the vehicle may mail the request and notification to the last known address of the owner or may otherwise send or deliver it to the owner.  If there are multiple owners of the same vehicle, the request and notification may be sent to one or more of them and it shall be sufficient for one owner to sign the statement.  The owner has a duty to return the signed and dated statement as directed in the notification.  In completing the odometer disclosure on the owner's behalf, the agent shall identify the same condition (i), (ii), or (iii) provided in the owner's statement, unless the agent knows that the condition identified in the owner's statement is not correct.  The agent will not indicate in the odometer disclosure it completes on the owner's behalf that the odometer reading is not the actual mileage unless either the owner has so indicated in the owner's statement or the agent knows that the owner's statement is not correct.  The agent shall transmit the owner's statement it receives to the transferee after the title transfer is completed.  The owner's statement received by the transferee under this subsection need not be filed with the filing office for the other title documents, but the transferee shall retain the owner's statement for a time period and in a similar manner to the retention methods used by a lessor to retain statements under 49 C.F.R. Section 580.8(b), as it may from time to time be amended.  The transferee may rely upon the agent's odometer disclosure and the owner's statement unless it knows that they are not correct.  A failure by an owner to comply with an obligation under this subsection subjects the owner to the penalties and enforcement provisions of Subchapter H but does not affect the validity of the transfer of title.
    
    (f)  This section does not in any way impair or impede any transfers made through use of a power of attorney prior to the effective date of this section, and such transfers shall continue to be valid if they comply with the provisions of this section or would otherwise comply with the law in effect prior to the effective date of this section.  This section does not apply to powers of attorney authorized under federal law or regulation that authorize a transferee to act as the agent of the transferor under certain circumstances or to powers of attorney otherwise authorized by the law of this state.  This section does not affect the use of powers of attorney to sign, complete, and deliver the form to transfer title and other documents necessary to transfer title, including the odometer disclosure, in title transfers other than those described in Subsection (a).
    
    (g)  The power of attorney created in this section shall be limited for the purposes and duration specified in this section.

    (b)  An assignee or assignor may, but need not to retain the validity, perfection, and priority of the lien assigned, as evidence of the assignment of a lien recorded under Section [501.113](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=501.113):
    
    (1)  apply  to the county assessor-collector for the assignee to be named as lienholder on the title; and
    
    (2)  notify  the debtor of the assignment.
    
    (c)  Failure to make application under Subsection (b) or notify a debtor of an assignment does not create a cause of action against the recorded lienholder, the assignor, or the assignee or affect the continuation of the perfected status of the assigned lien in favor of the assignee against transferees from and creditors of the debtor, including lien creditors, as defined by Section [9.102](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.102), Business & Commerce Code.
    
    (d)  An application under Subsection (b) must be acknowledged by the assignee.
    
    (e)  On receipt of the completed application and fee, the department may:
    
    (1)  amend the department's records to substitute the assignee for the recorded lienholder; and
    
    (2)  issue a new title as provided by this chapter.
    
    (f)  The issuance of a title under Subsection (e) is recordation of the assignment.
    
    (g)  Regardless of whether application is made for the assignee to be named as lienholder on the title, the time of the recordation of a lien assigned under this section is considered to be the time the lien was initially recorded under Section [501.113](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=501.113).
    
    (h)  Notwithstanding Subsections (a)-(g) and procedures that may be conducted under those subsections, the assignment of a lien does not affect the procedures applicable to the foreclosure of a worker's lien under Chapter [70](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=70), Property Code, or the rights of the holder of a worker's lien.  Notice given to the last known lienholder of record, as provided by that chapter, is adequate to allow foreclosure under that chapter.
    
    (i)  Notwithstanding Subsections (a)-(g) and the procedures that may be conducted under those subsections, the assignment of a lien does not affect the procedures applicable to the release of a holder's lien under Section [348.408](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=348.408), Finance Code.

    (a-1)  On the sale or transfer of a motor vehicle to a dealer who holds a general distinguishing number issued under Chapter [503](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=503), the dealer shall submit the notice of transfer under Subsection (a).
    
    (b)  The notice of transfer shall be provided by the department and must include a place for the seller to state:
    
    (1)  a complete description of the vehicle as prescribed by the department;
    
    (2)  the full name, address, and telephone number of the seller;

    (5)  the signature of the seller; and
    
    (6)  the date the seller signed the form.
    
    (c)  This subsection applies only if the department receives notice under Subsection (a) that includes the full name, address, and telephone number of the purchaser before the 30th day after the date the seller delivered possession of the vehicle to the purchaser or in accordance with Section [152.069](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=152.069), Tax Code.

    (1)  the owner of the vehicle; and
    
    (2)  subject to civil and criminal liability arising out of the use, operation, or abandonment of the vehicle, to the extent that ownership of the vehicle subjects the owner of the vehicle to criminal or civil liability under another provision of law.
    
    (d)  The department may adopt  rules to implement this section.
    
    (e)  This section does not impose or establish civil or criminal liability on the owner of a motor vehicle who transfers ownership of the vehicle but does not disclose the transfer to the department.

Proof by the transferor that the transferor filed a form under this section is a complete defense to an action brought against the transferor for an act or omission, civil or criminal, arising out of the use, operation, or abandonment of the vehicle by another person after the transferor filed the form.  A copy of the form filed under this section is proof of the filing of the form.
