    Sec. 366.038.  TOLLING SERVICES.  (a)  In this section, "tolling services" means the tolling services normally provided through an authority's customer service center, including customer service, customer account maintenance, transponder supply, and toll collection and enforcement.
    
    (b)  An authority shall provide, for reasonable compensation, tolling services for a toll project in the boundaries of the authority, regardless of whether the toll project is developed, financed, constructed, and operated under an agreement, including a comprehensive development agreement, with the authority or another entity.  This section does not restrict an authority from agreeing to provide additional tolling services in an agreement described in Subsection (d).  Additional tolling services provided under an agreement under that subsection are subject to the provisions that apply to tolling services under this section.
    
    (c)  An authority may not provide financial security, including a cash collateral account, for the performance of tolling services the authority provides under this section if:
    
    (1)  the authority determines that providing security could restrict the amount, or increase the cost, of bonds or other debt obligations the authority may subsequently issue under this chapter; or
    
    (2)  the authority is not reimbursed its cost of providing the security.
    
    (d)  Before providing tolling services for a toll project under this section, an authority must enter into a written agreement that sets out the terms and conditions for the tolling services to be provided and the terms of compensation for those services.
    
    (e)  Toll revenues are the property of the entity that is entitled to the revenues under a tolling services agreement for the toll project, regardless of who holds or collects the revenues.  Toll revenues that are held or collected by an authority under a tolling services agreement and are not the property of the authority are not subject to a claim adverse to the authority or a lien on or encumbrance against property of the authority.  Toll revenues that are the property of the authority are not subject to a claim adverse to any other entity or a lien on or encumbrance against property of any other entity.
    
    (f)  An authority may agree in a tolling services agreement that its right and obligation to provide tolling services for the applicable toll project under this section are subject to termination for default and that after a termination for default this section does not apply to that toll project.
    
    (g)  Any public or private entity, including an authority or the department, may agree to fund a cash collateral account for the purpose of providing money that may be withdrawn as provided in the tolling services agreement because of an authority's failure to make any payment as required by the tolling services agreement.  An authority's written commitment to fully or partially fund a cash collateral account is conclusive evidence of the authority's determination that the commitment does not violate Subsection (c).  The department may use money from any available source to fund a cash collateral account under this subsection.
    
    (h)  For purposes of Subchapter [C](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=372.101), Chapter [372](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=372), a toll project for which an authority provides tolling services under a tolling services agreement is considered a toll project of the authority and the authority is considered the toll project entity with respect to all rights and remedies arising under that subchapter regarding the toll project. The authority may not stop, detain, or impound a motor vehicle as authorized under that subchapter on a toll project's active traffic lanes unless a tolling service agreement addresses that action.

    (b)  An authority may transfer an amount from a surplus fund established for a turnpike project or system to the authority's feasibility study fund if the remainder of the surplus fund is not less than any minimum amount required by the bond proceedings to be retained for that turnpike project or system.
    
    (c)  Money in the feasibility study fund may be used only to pay the expenses of studying the cost and feasibility and any other expenses relating to:
    
    (1)  the preparation and issuance of bonds for the acquisition and construction of a proposed turnpike project or system;

    (b-4)  If the registered owner of the nonpaying vehicle fails to pay the unpaid tolls included in the invoice mailed under Subsection (b-2) or (b-3) by the date specified in the invoice, the authority shall send the first notice of nonpayment by first class mail to the registered owner of the nonpaying vehicle as provided by Subsection (d).
    
    (c)  On issuance of the first notice of nonpayment, the registered owner of the nonpaying vehicle shall pay both the unpaid tolls included in the invoice and an administrative fee.  The authority may charge only one administrative fee of not more than $25 for the first notice of nonpayment that is sent to the registered owner of the nonpaying vehicle.
    
    (d)  Unless an authority requires additional time to send a notice of nonpayment because of events outside the authority's reasonable control, the authority shall send the first notice of nonpayment not later than the 30th day after the date the 25-day period expires for the registered owner to pay the invoice issued under Subsection (b-2) or (b-3). If an authority requires additional time as provided by this subsection, the authority must send the notice not later than the 60th day after the date the 25-day period expires for the registered owner to pay the invoice issued under Subsection (b-2) or (b-3). The first notice of nonpayment shall require payment of the unpaid tolls included in the invoice and the administrative fee before the 25th day after the date the first notice of nonpayment is mailed.
    
    (d-1)  If the registered owner of the nonpaying vehicle fails to pay the unpaid tolls and the administrative fee by the date specified in the first notice of nonpayment, the authority shall send a second notice of nonpayment by first class mail to the registered owner of the nonpaying vehicle.  The second notice of nonpayment must specify the date by which payment must be made and may require payment of:
    
    (1)  the unpaid tolls and administrative fee included in the first notice of nonpayment; and
    
    (2)  an additional administrative fee of not more than $25 for each unpaid toll included in the notice, not to exceed a total of $200.
    
    (d-2)  If the registered owner of the nonpaying vehicle fails to pay the amount included in the second notice of nonpayment by the date specified in that notice, the authority shall send a third notice of nonpayment by first class mail to the registered owner of the nonpaying vehicle.  The third notice of nonpayment must specify the date by which payment must be made and may require payment of:
    
    (1)  the amount included in the second notice of nonpayment; and
    
    (2)  any third-party collection service fees incurred by the authority.
    
    (e)  If the registered owner of the vehicle fails to pay the amount included in the third notice of nonpayment by the date specified in the notice, the owner may be cited as for other traffic violations as provided by law, and the owner shall pay a fine of not more than $250 for each nonpayment of a toll.
    
    (f)  Except as provided by Subsection (f-1), in the prosecution of a violation for nonpayment, proof that the vehicle passed through a toll assessment facility and that the amount included in the third notice of nonpayment was not paid before the date specified in the notice, together with proof that the defendant was the registered owner or the driver of the vehicle when the unpaid toll was assessed, establishes the nonpayment of the registered owner.  The proof may be by testimony of a peace officer or authority employee, video surveillance, or any other reasonable evidence, including a copy of the rental, lease, or other contract document or the electronic data provided to the authority under Subsection (i) that shows the defendant was the lessee of the vehicle when the unpaid toll was assessed.
    
    (f-1)  Nonpayment by the registered owner of the vehicle may be established by:
    
    (1)  a copy of a written agreement between the authority and the registered owner for the payment of unpaid tolls and administrative fees; and
    
    (2)  evidence that the registered owner is in default under the agreement.
    
    (g)  The court of the local jurisdiction in which the unpaid toll was assessed may assess and collect the fine in addition to any court costs. The court may collect and forward to the authority properly assessed unpaid tolls, administrative fees, and third-party collection service fees incurred by the authority as determined by:
    
    (1)  the court after a hearing; or
    
    (2)  written agreement of the registered owner.
    
    (h)  It is a defense to nonpayment under this section that the motor vehicle in question was stolen before the failure to pay the proper toll occurred and was not recovered by the time of the failure to pay, but only if the theft was reported to the appropriate law enforcement authority before the earlier of:
    
    (1)  the occurrence of the failure to pay;  or
    
    (2)  eight hours after the discovery of the theft.
    
    (i)  A registered owner who is the lessor of a vehicle for which an invoice is mailed under Subsection (b-2) or (b-3) is not liable if, not later than the 30th day after the date the invoice is mailed, the registered owner provides to the authority:
    
    (1)  a copy of the rental, lease, or other contract document covering the vehicle on the date the unpaid toll was assessed, with the name and address of the lessee clearly legible; or
    
    (2)  electronic data, other than a photocopy or scan of a rental or lease contract, that contains the information required under Sections [521.460](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=521.460)(c)(1), (2), and (3) covering the vehicle on the date the unpaid toll was assessed under this section.
    
    (i-1)  If the lessor timely provides the required information under Subsection (i), the lessee of the vehicle on the date the unpaid toll was assessed is considered to be the registered owner of the vehicle for purposes of this section, and the authority shall follow the procedures provided by this section as if the lessee were the registered owner of the vehicle, including sending an invoice to the lessee by first-class mail not later than the 30th day after the date of the receipt of the information from the lessor.
    
    (j)  In addition to the other powers and duties provided by this chapter, an authority has the same powers and duties as the department under Chapter [228](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=228), a county under Chapter [284](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=284), and a regional mobility authority under Chapter [370](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=370), regarding the authority's toll collection and enforcement powers for:
    
    (1)  the authority's turnpike projects; and
    
    (2)  other toll projects developed, financed, constructed, or operated under an agreement, including a comprehensive development agreement, with the authority.
    
    (k)  As authorized under Section [322.008](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=322.008)(d)(2), Business & Commerce Code, an authority may provide information, including an invoice or notice, required under this section to be sent first class mail instead as an electronic record:
    
    (1)  if the recipient of the information agrees to the transmission of the information as an electronic record; and
    
    (2)  on terms acceptable to the recipient.
