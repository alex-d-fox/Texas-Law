    Sec. 703.002.  ENACTMENT;  TERMS OF COMPACT.  The Nonresident Violator Compact of 1977 is enacted and entered into as follows:
    
    NONRESIDENT VIOLATOR COMPACT OF 1977
    
      
    
    
    Art. I. FINDINGS, DECLARATION OF POLICY, AND PURPOSE
    
      
    
    
    (a)  The party jurisdictions find that:
    
    (1)  In most instances, a motorist who is cited for a traffic violation in a jurisdiction other than his home jurisdiction:
    
    (i)  Must post collateral or bond to secure appearance for trial at a later date;  or
    
    (ii)  If unable to post collateral or bond, is taken into custody until the collateral or bond is posted;  or
    
    (iii)  Is taken directly to court for his trial to be held.
    
    (2)  In some instances, the motorist's driver's license may be deposited as collateral to be returned after he has complied with the terms of the citation.
    
    (3)  The purpose of the practices described in paragraphs (1) and (2) above is to ensure compliance with the terms of a traffic citation by the motorist who, if permitted to continue on his way after receiving the traffic citation, could return to his home jurisdiction and disregard his duty under the terms of the traffic citation.
    
    (4)  A motorist receiving a traffic citation in his home jurisdiction is permitted, except for certain violations, to accept the citation from the officer at the scene of the violation and to immediately continue on his way after promising or being instructed to comply with the terms of the citation.
    
    (5)  The practice described in paragraph (1) above causes unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, a hardship for the motorist who is unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial, or pay the fine, and thus is compelled to remain in custody until some arrangement can be made.
    
    (6)  The deposit of a driver's license as a bail bond, as described in paragraph (2) above, is viewed with disfavor.
    
    (7)  The practices described herein consume an undue amount of law enforcement time.
    
    (b)  It is the policy of the party jurisdictions to:
    
    (1)  Seek compliance with the laws, ordinances, and administrative rules and regulations relating to the operation of motor vehicles in each of the jurisdictions.
    
    (2)  Allow motorists to accept a traffic citation for certain violations and proceed on their way without delay whether or not the motorist is a resident of the jurisdiction in which the citation was issued.
    
    (3)  Extend cooperation to its fullest extent among the jurisdictions for obtaining compliance with the terms of a traffic citation issued in one jurisdiction to a resident of another jurisdiction.
    
    (4)  Maximize effective utilization of law enforcement personnel and assist court systems in the efficient disposition of traffic violations.
    
    (c)  The purpose of this compact is to:
    
    (1)  Provide a means through which the party jurisdictions may participate in a reciprocal program to effectuate the policies enumerated in paragraph (b) above in a uniform and orderly manner.
    
    (2)  Provide for the fair and impartial treatment of traffic violators operating within party jurisdictions in recognition of the motorist's right of due process and the sovereign status of a party jurisdiction.
    
    Art. II. DEFINITIONS

    (2)  "Collateral" means any cash or other security deposited to secure an appearance for trial, following the issuance by a police officer of a citation for a traffic violation.
    
    (3)  "Court" means a court of law or traffic tribunal.
    
    (4)  "Driver's license" means any license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle issued under the laws of the home jurisdiction.
    
    (5)  "Home jurisdiction" means the jurisdiction that issued the driver's license of the traffic violator.
    
    (6)  "Issuing jurisdiction" means the jurisdiction in which the traffic citation was issued to the motorist.
    
    (7)  "Jurisdiction" means a state, territory, or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
    
    (8)  "Motorist" means a driver of a motor vehicle operating in a party jurisdiction other than the home jurisdiction.
    
    (9)  "Personal recognizance" means an agreement by a motorist made at the time of issuance of the traffic citation that he will comply with the terms of that traffic citation.
    
    (10)  "Police officer" means any individual authorized by the party jurisdiction to issue a citation for a traffic violation.

    (a)  When issuing a citation for a traffic violation, a police officer shall issue the citation to a motorist who possesses a driver's license issued by a party jurisdiction and shall not, subject to the exceptions noted in paragraph (b) of this article, require the motorist to post collateral to secure appearance, if the officer receives the motorist's personal recognizance that he or she will comply with the terms of the citation.
    
    (b)  Personal recognizance is acceptable only if not prohibited by law.  If mandatory appearance is required, it must take place immediately following issuance of the citation.

The report shall be made in accordance with procedures specified by the issuing jurisdiction and shall contain information as specified in the Compact Manual as minimum requirements for effective processing by the home jurisdiction.
    
    (d)  Upon receipt of the report, the licensing authority of the issuing jurisdiction shall transmit to the licensing authority in the home jurisdiction of the motorist the information in a form and content as contained in the Compact Manual.
    
    (e)  The licensing authority of the issuing jurisdiction may not suspend the privilege of a motorist for whom a report has been transmitted.
    
    (f)  The licensing authority of the issuing jurisdiction shall not transmit a report on any violation if the date of transmission is more than six months after the date on which the traffic citation was issued.
    
    (g)  The licensing authority of the issuing jurisdiction shall not transmit a report on any violation where the date of issuance of the citation predates the most recent of the effective dates of entry for the two jurisdictions affected.
    
    Art. IV. PROCEDURE FOR HOME JURISDICTION
    
      
    
    
    (a)  Upon receipt of a report of a failure to comply from the licensing authority of the issuing jurisdiction, the licensing authority of the home jurisdiction shall notify the motorist and initiate a suspension action, in accordance with the home jurisdiction's procedures, to suspend the motorist's driver's license until satisfactory evidence of compliance with the terms of the traffic citation has been furnished to the home jurisdiction licensing authority.  Due process safeguards will be accorded.
    
    (b)  The licensing authority of the home jurisdiction shall maintain a record of actions taken and make reports to issuing jurisdictions as provided in the Compact Manual.
    
    Art. V. APPLICABILITY OF OTHER LAWS
