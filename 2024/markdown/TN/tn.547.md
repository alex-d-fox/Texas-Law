    (b)  A motorcycle, other than a motorcycle equipped with a motor that has an engine piston displacement of 250 cubic centimeters or less, shall be equipped with multiple-beam lighting equipment that produces:
    
    (1)  an uppermost distribution of light that reveals a person or vehicle at a distance of at least 300 feet ahead; and
    
    (2)  a lowermost distribution of light that:
    
    (A)  reveals a person or vehicle at a distance of at least 150 feet ahead; and
    
    (B)  is aimed so that no part of the high-intensity portion of the beam on the motorcycle that is on a straight and level road under any condition of loading projects into the eyes of an approaching vehicle operator.
    
    (c)  A moped or a motorcycle equipped with a motor that has an engine piston displacement of 250 cubic centimeters or less shall be equipped with:
    
    (1)  multiple-beam lighting equipment that complies with the requirements of Subsection (b); or
    
    (2)  single-beam lighting equipment that:
    
    (A)  emits light sufficient to reveal a person or vehicle:
    
    (i)  at a distance of at least 100 feet when the moped or motorcycle is operated at a speed less than 25 miles per hour;
    
    (ii)  at a distance of at least 200 feet when the moped or motorcycle is operated at a speed of 25 miles per hour or more; and
    
    (iii)  at a distance of at least 300 feet when the moped or motorcycle is operated at a speed of 35 miles per hour or more; and
    
    (B)  is aimed so that no part of the high-intensity portion of the beam from the lamp on a loaded moped or motorcycle projects a beam higher than the level center of the lamp for a distance of 25 feet ahead.
    
    (d)  A motorcycle may not be operated at any time unless at least one headlamp on the motorcycle is illuminated.  This subsection does not apply to a motorcycle manufactured before the model year 1975.
