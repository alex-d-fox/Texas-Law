    CHAPTER 461. STATEWIDE COORDINATION OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 461.001.  LEGISLATIVE INTENT AND CONSTRUCTION.  (a)  Public transportation services are provided in this state by many different entities, both public and private.  The multiplicity of public transportation providers and services, coupled with a lack of coordination between state oversight agencies, has generated inefficiencies, overlaps in service, and confusion for consumers.  It is the intent of this chapter:
    
    (1)  to eliminate waste in the provision of public transportation services;
    
    (2)  to generate efficiencies that will permit increased levels of service;  and
    
    (3)  to further the state's efforts to reduce air pollution.
    
    (b)  This chapter shall be liberally construed to achieve its purposes.

It also does not include a person who provides intercity rail or bus service, commercial air transportation, water transportation, or nonstop service to or from a point located outside this state.  If a person provides both public transportation services and services that are not public transportation services, that person is included within the term only with regard to the provision of public transportation services and to the extent of those public transportation services.
    
    (2)  "Public transportation services" means any conveyance of passengers and their hand-carried baggage by a governmental entity or by a private entity if the private entity receives financial assistance for that conveyance from any governmental entity.

    (b)  If public transportation providers do not reach an agreement on a service plan under Subsection (a), the department may develop an interim service plan for that area.
