    (B)  giving to the court a supersedeas bond approved by the court for the amount of the penalty and that is effective until all judicial review of the board's order is final;  or
    
    (2)  request the court to stay enforcement of the penalty by:
    
    (A)  filing with the court a sworn affidavit of the person stating that the person is financially unable to pay the amount of the penalty and is financially unable to give the supersedeas bond;  and

    (m)  If the person does not pay the amount of the penalty and the enforcement of the penalty is not stayed, the commission may refer the matter to the attorney general for collection of the amount of the penalty.
    
    (n)  Judicial review of the order of the commission:

    (2)  is under the substantial evidence rule.
    
    (o)  If the court sustains the occurrence of the violation, the court may uphold or reduce the amount of the penalty and order the person to pay the full or reduced amount of the penalty.  If the court does not sustain the occurrence of the violation, the court shall order that no penalty is owed.
    
    (p)  When the judgment of the court becomes final, the court shall proceed under this subsection.  If the person paid the amount of the penalty and if that amount is reduced or is not upheld by the court, the court shall order that the appropriate amount plus accrued interest be remitted to the person.  The rate of the interest is the rate charged on loans to depository institutions by the New York Federal Reserve Bank, and the interest shall be paid for the period beginning on the date the penalty was paid and ending on the date the penalty is remitted.  If the person gave a supersedeas bond and if the amount of the penalty is not upheld by the court, the court shall order the release of the bond.  If the person gave a supersedeas bond and if the amount of the penalty is reduced, the court shall order the release of the bond after the person pays the amount.
    
    (q)  A penalty collected under this section shall be remitted to the comptroller for the deposit to the credit of the oil-field cleanup fund.
    
    (r)  All proceedings under this section are subject to Chapter [2001](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code.
