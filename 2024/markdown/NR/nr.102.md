    Sec. 102.011.  AUTHORITY OF COMMISSION.  When two or more separately owned tracts of land are embraced in a common reservoir of oil or gas for which the commission has established the size and shape of proration units, whether by temporary or permanent field rules, and where there are separately owned interests in oil and gas within an existing or proposed proration unit in the common reservoir and the owners have not agreed to pool their interests, and where at least one of the owners of the right to drill has drilled or has proposed to drill a well on the existing or proposed proration unit to the common reservoir, the commission, on the application of an owner specified in Section [102.012](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=102.012) of this code and for the purpose of avoiding the drilling of unnecessary wells, protecting correlative rights, or preventing waste, shall establish a unit and pool all of the interests in the unit within an area containing the approximate acreage of the proration unit, which unit shall in no event exceed 160 acres for an oil well or 640 acres for a gas well plus 10 percent tolerance.

    (b)  If the conditions specified in Subsection (a) of this section exist, the commission shall pool the smaller tract with adjacent acreage on a fair and reasonable basis and may authorize a larger allowable for the unit if it exceeds the size of the standard proration unit for the reservoir.

    (b)  Notwithstanding the provisions in Subsection (a) of this section, if the commission finds that allocation on a surface-acreage basis does not allocate to each tract its fair share, the commission shall allocate the production so that each tract will receive its fair share, which for any nonconsenting owner shall be no less than he would receive under a surface-acreage allocation.

    (b)  If only part of a tract is included in the unit, operations on, production from, or a shut-in gas well on the unit shall maintain an oil and gas lease on the tract as to the part excluded from the unit only if the lease would be maintained had the unit been created voluntarily under the provisions of the lease.
