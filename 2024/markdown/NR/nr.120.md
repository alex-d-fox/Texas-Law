    (2)  "Clean energy project" means a project to construct a coal-fueled, natural gas-fueled, or petroleum coke-fueled electric generating facility, including a facility in which the fuel is gasified before combustion, that will:
    
    (A)  have a capacity of at least 200 megawatts;
    
    (B)  meet the emissions profile for an advanced clean energy project under Section [382.003](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=382.003)(1-a)(B), Health and Safety Code;
    
    (C)  capture at least 70 percent of the carbon dioxide resulting from or associated with the generation of electricity by the facility;
    
    (D)  be capable of permanently sequestering in a geological formation the carbon dioxide captured; and
    
    (E)  be capable of supplying the carbon dioxide captured for purposes of an enhanced oil recovery project.
    
    (3)  "Commission" means the Railroad Commission of Texas.
    
    (4)  "Sequester" means to inject carbon dioxide into a geological formation in a manner and under conditions that create a reasonable expectation that at least 99 percent of the carbon dioxide injected will remain sequestered from the atmosphere for at least 1,000 years.
