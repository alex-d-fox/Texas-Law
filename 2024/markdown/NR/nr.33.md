    "(1) The real property described in and subject to this contract adjoins and shares a common boundary with the tidally influenced submerged lands of the state.  The boundary is subject to change and can be determined accurately only by a survey on the ground made by a licensed state land surveyor in accordance with the original grant from the sovereign.  The owner of the property described in this contract may gain or lose portions of the tract because of changes in the boundary.
    
    "NOTICE REGARDING COASTAL AREA PROPERTY
    
      
    
    
    "(2) The seller, transferor, or grantor has no knowledge of any prior fill as it relates to the property described in and subject to this contract.

    "(4) The purchaser or grantee is hereby advised to seek the advice of an attorney or other qualified person as to the legal nature and effect of the facts set forth in this notice on the property described in and subject to this contract.  Information regarding the location of the applicable tide line as to the property described in and subject to this contract may be obtained from the surveying division of the General Land Office in Austin."
    
    (b)  If property described under Subsection (a) of this section is sold, transferred, or conveyed without an executory contract for conveyance, a written statement containing the notice prescribed by that subsection must be delivered to the grantee for execution and acknowledgement of receipt before the conveyance is recorded.
    
    (c)  Failure to include the statement in an executory contract for conveyance shall be grounds for the purchaser to terminate such contract, and upon termination any earnest money shall be returned to the party making the deposit.
    
    (d)  Failure to provide this statement prior to closing, either in the executory contract for conveyance or in a separate written statement, shall constitute a deceptive act under Section [17.46](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=17.46), Business & Commerce Code.
    
    (e)  This section or the action of any party subject to this section does not diminish or modify the beach access and use rights of the public as acquired by statute or under common law.

    Sec. 33.136.  PROPERTY RIGHTS:  PRESERVATION OF LITTORAL RIGHTS.  (a)  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a person may not undertake an action on or immediately landward of a public beach or submerged land, including state mineral lands, relating to erosion response that will cause or contribute to shoreline alteration before the person has conducted and filed a coastal boundary survey in the same manner as the survey of public land required by Chapter [21](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=21) and any applicable rule of the commissioner and has obtained any required lease or other instrument from the commissioner or board, as applicable.  A person is not required to obtain a lease or other instrument from the commissioner or board if the action is confined to land owned by a navigation district or municipality.  On filing of the survey, the shoreline depicted on the survey is a fixed line for the purpose of locating a shoreline boundary, subject to movement landward of that line.  A coastal boundary survey conducted under this section may not be filed until the commissioner gives notice of approval under Subsection (c).
    
    (b)  The survey must contain the following statement:  "NOTICE:  This survey was performed in accordance with Section [33.136](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=33.136), Natural Resources Code, for the purpose of evidencing the location of the shoreline in the area depicted in this survey as that shoreline existed before commencement of erosion response activity, as required by Chapter [33](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=33), Natural Resources Code.  The line depicted on this survey fixes the shoreline for the purpose of locating a shoreline boundary, subject to movement landward as provided by Section [33.136](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=33.136), Natural Resources Code."
    
    (c)  Within 30 days after the date the commissioner approves a coastal boundary survey under this section, the commissioner shall provide notice of that approval by:
    
    (1)  publication in the Texas Register;
    
    (2)  publication for two consecutive weeks on the Internet website of the land office; and
    
    (3)  filing a copy of the approval in the archives and records division of the land office.
    
    (d)  A person who claims title to permanent school fund land as a result of accretion, reliction, or avulsion in the coastal zone on or after September 1, 1999, must, in order to prevail in the claim, prove that:
    
    (1)  a change in the shoreline has occurred;
    
    (2)  the change did not occur as a result of the claimant's actions, the action of any predecessor in title, the action of any grantee, assignee, licensee, or person authorized by the claimant to use the claimant's land, or an erosion response activity;  and
    
    (3)  the claimant is entitled to benefit from the change.
    
    (e)  An upland owner who, because of erosion response activity undertaken by the commissioner, ceases to hold title to land that extends to the shoreline as altered by the erosion response activity is entitled to continue to exercise all littoral rights possessed by that owner before the date the erosion response activity commenced, including rights of ingress, egress, boating, bathing, and fishing.
    
    (f)  In this section, "erosion response" means an action intended to address coastal erosion, mitigate the effect of coastal erosion, or maintain or enhance beach stability or width.  The term includes:
    
    (1)  beach nourishment;
    
    (2)  sediment management;
    
    (3)  beneficial use of dredged material;
    
    (4)  construction of breakwaters;

    Sec. 33.206.  ACTION BY COMMISSIONER OR ATTORNEY GENERAL.  (a)  A proposed action is consistent with the goals and policies of the coastal management program and approved by the commissioner unless the commissioner determines the action to be inconsistent with the coastal management program and protests the action.
    
    (b)  If the commissioner protests the proposed action, the commissioner shall report the commissioner's findings on the matter to the agency or subdivision.  The report shall specify how the proposed action is inconsistent with the goals and policies of the coastal management program and include specific recommendations of the commissioner regarding how the proposed action may be modified or amended to make it consistent with the program.  Before the 21st day after the date the agency or subdivision receives the report, the agency or subdivision shall review the findings and recommendations and determine whether to modify or amend the proposed action to make it consistent with the goals and policies of the coastal management program and shall notify the commissioner of its decision.
    
    (c)  If an agency or subdivision does not modify or amend a proposed action to be consistent with the goals and policies of the coastal management program, the commissioner shall request the attorney general to issue an opinion on the consistency of the proposed action with the coastal management program.  The agency or subdivision is stayed from taking the proposed action until the attorney general issues the opinion.  The attorney general shall issue an opinion before the 26th day after the date the commissioner requests the opinion.
    
    (d)  The commissioner shall adopt guidance and procedural rules for the review of federal actions, activities, and outer continental shelf plans that incorporate the provisions of federal regulations governing those reviews.  The guidance and rules shall provide that the commissioner or any three committee members may request additional information from a federal agency or additional time for review as provided by the federal regulations.
    
    (e)  The commissioner shall review any federal action, activity, or outer continental shelf plan that any three committee members agree presents a significant unresolved issue regarding consistency with the goals and policies of the coastal management program.

The determination regarding the consistency of an action made by the commissioner under this subsection constitutes the state's determination regarding consistency of the equivalent agency or subdivision action or federal action.
    
    (g)  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subchapter, on request for referral, the commissioner may not review a consistency determination of the land office, the commissioner, or the board.  The commissioner shall refer a request for a review of the consistency of such an action to the attorney general not later than the second day after the date the commissioner receives the request.  The attorney general shall determine whether the action is consistent with the goals and policies of the coastal management program in accordance with the applicable provisions of this subchapter governing determinations by the commissioner.  If the attorney general determines the action to be inconsistent with the goals and policies of the coastal management program, the attorney general may protest the action in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter governing protests by the commissioner.  A protest by the attorney general has the same effect as a protest by the commissioner.  The attorney general may adopt rules as necessary to implement this subsection.
