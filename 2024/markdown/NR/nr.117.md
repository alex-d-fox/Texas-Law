    (a-1)  Rules adopted under Subsection (a) that apply to the intrastate transportation of hazardous liquids and carbon dioxide by gathering pipelines in rural locations and intrastate hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide gathering pipeline facilities in rural locations must be based only on the risks the transportation and the facilities present to the public safety, except that the commission shall revise the rules as necessary to comply with Subsection (c) and to maintain the maximum degree of federal delegation permissible under 49 U.S.C. Section 60101 et seq., or a succeeding law, if the federal government adopts rules that include safety standards applicable to the transportation and facilities.
    
    (b)  Rules that adopt safety standards do not apply to production, refining, or manufacturing facilities or storage or in-plant piping systems associated with any of those facilities.

    (1)  mailing a written request for a meeting in person to the appropriate officials by certified mail, return receipt requested;
    
    (2)  sending a request for a meeting in person to the appropriate officials by facsimile transmission; or

    (i)  If the operator or operator's representative cannot arrange a meeting in person after complying with Subsection (h), the operator or the operator's representative shall conduct community liaison activities by one of the following methods:
    
    (1)  holding a telephone conference with the appropriate officials; or
    
    (2)  delivering the community liaison information required to be conveyed by certified mail, return receipt requested.

    (1)  on written request from the school district, provide in writing the following parts of a pipeline emergency response plan that are relevant to the school:
    
    (A)  a description and map of the pipeline facilities that are within 1,000 feet of the school building or facility;
    
    (B)  a list of any product transported in the segment of the pipeline that is within 1,000 feet of the school facility;
    
    (C)  the designated emergency number for the pipeline facility operator;
    
    (D)  information on the state's excavation one-call system;  and
    
    (E)  information on how to recognize, report, and respond to a product release;  and
    
    (2)  mail a copy of the requested items by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the superintendent of the school district in which the school building or facility is located.
    
    (l)  A pipeline operator or the operator's representative shall appear at a regularly scheduled meeting of the school board to explain the items listed in Subsection (k) if requested by the school board or school district.
    
    (m)  The commission may not require the release of parts of an emergency response plan that include security sensitive information including maps or data.  Security sensitive information shall be made available for review by but not provided to the school board.

    (1)  surface mining operations; or
    
    (2)  other entities or occupations if the commission determines in its rulemaking process that exempting those entities or occupations from rules adopted under that subsection:
    
    (A)  is in the public interest; or
    
    (B)  is not likely to cause harm to the safety and welfare of the public.

    (c)  A charge authorized by Subsection (b)(1) may not exceed the cost to the city of administering, supervising, inspecting, and otherwise regulating the location of the pipeline facility, including maintaining records and maps of the location of the pipeline facility.
    
    (d)  The owner or operator of a pipeline facility may appeal the assessment of a charge under Subsection (b)(1) to the commission.  The commission shall hear the appeal de novo.  Unless the city that assessed the charge establishes that the charge is authorized by this section, the commission shall declare the charge invalid or reduce the charge to an amount authorized by this section.  The commission has exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a charge under Subsection (b)(1) is authorized by this section.  The owner or operator of the pipeline facility and the city shall share equally the costs incurred by the commission in connection with the appeal.
    
    (e)  A city must file suit to collect a charge authorized by Subsection (b)(1) not later than the fourth anniversary of the date the charge becomes due.  The running of the limitations period under this subsection is tolled on the filing of an appeal of the charge under Subsection (d) and begins running again on the date the appeal is determined.
    
    (f)  This section may not be construed to prevent a city from:
    
    (1)  recovering the reasonable cost of repairing damage to a city facility, other than a public way, caused by acts of the owner or operator of a pipeline facility; or
    
    (2)  requiring the owner or operator of a pipeline facility to relocate the pipeline facility, at the owner's or operator's expense, to permit the construction, maintenance, modification, or alteration of a city facility.
    
    (g)  Notwithstanding Subsection (f)(2), the city shall pay the cost of relocating a pipeline facility if the pipeline facility is authorized by a property right that has priority over the city's right to use the public way for the city facility.
