    Sec. 101.011.  AUTHORIZED AGREEMENTS FOR SEPARATELY OWNED PROPERTIES.  Subject to the approval of the commission, as provided in this chapter, persons owning or controlling production, leases, royalties, or other interests in separate property in the same oil field, gas field, or oil and gas field may voluntarily enter into and perform agreements for either or both of the following purposes:
    
    (1)  to establish pooled units, necessary to effect secondary recovery operations for oil or gas, including those known as cycling, recycling, repressuring, water flooding, and pressure maintenance and to establish and operate cooperative facilities necessary for the secondary recovery operations;
    
    (2)  to establish pooled units and cooperative facilities necessary for the conservation and use of gas, including those for extracting and separating the hydrocarbons from the natural gas or casinghead gas and returning the dry gas to a formation underlying any land or leases committed to the agreement.

No person shall be compelled or required to enter into such an agreement.

    Sec. 101.013.  COMMISSION APPROVAL.  (a)  Agreements for pooled units and cooperative facilities are not legal or effective until the commission finds, after application, notice, and hearing:
    
    (1)  that the agreement is necessary to accomplish the purposes specified in Section [101.011](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=101.011) of this code;
    
    (2)  that it is in the interest of the public welfare as being reasonably necessary to prevent waste and to promote the conservation of oil or gas or both;
    
    (3)  that the rights of the owners of all the interests in the field, whether signers of the unit agreement or not, would be protected under its operation;
    
    (4)  that the estimated additional cost, if any, of conducting the operation will not exceed the value of additional oil and gas so recovered, by or on behalf of the several persons affected, including royalty owners, owners of overriding royalties, oil and gas payments, carried interests, lien claimants, and others as well as the lessees;
    
    (5)  that other available or existing methods or facilities for secondary recovery operations or for the conservation and utilization of gas in the particular area or field concerned or for both are inadequate for the purposes;  and
    
    (6)  that the area covered by the unit agreement contains only that part of the field that has reasonably been defined by development, and that the owners of interests in the oil and gas under each tract of land in the area reasonably defined by development are given an opportunity to enter into the unit on the same yardstick basis as the owners of interests in the oil and gas under the other tracts in the unit.
    
    (b)  A finding by the commission that the area described in the unit agreement is insufficient or covers more acreage than is necessary to accomplish the purposes of this chapter is grounds for the disapproval of the agreement.

    Sec. 101.015.  COMMISSION REGULATION.  An agreement executed under the provisions of this chapter is subject to any valid order or rule of the commission relating to location, spacing, proration, conservation, or other matters within the authority of the commission, whether adopted prior to or subsequent to the execution of the agreement.

    Sec. 101.016.  PERMISSIBLE PROVISIONS.  (a)  An agreement authorized by this chapter may provide for the location and spacing of input wells and for the extension of leases covering any part of land committed to the unit as long as operations for drilling or reworking are conducted on the unit or as long as production of oil or gas in paying quantities is had from any part of the land or leases committed to the unit.  However, no agreement may relieve an operator from the obligation to develop reasonably the land and leases as a whole committed to the unit.
    
    (b)  An agreement authorized by this chapter may provide that the dry gas after extraction of hydrocarbons may be returned to a formation underlying any land or leases committed to the agreement and may provide that no royalties are required to be paid on the gas so returned.

    Sec. 101.017.  PROHIBITED PROVISIONS.  (a)  No agreement authorized by this chapter may attempt to contain the field rules for the area or field, or provide for or limit the amount of production of oil or gas from the unit properties, those provisions being solely the province of the commission.
    
    (b)  No agreement authorized by this chapter may provide directly or indirectly for the cooperative refining of crude petroleum, distillate, condensate, or gas, or any by-product of crude petroleum, distillate, condensate, or gas.  The extraction of liquid hydrocarbons from gas, and the separation of the liquid hydrocarbons into propanes, butanes, ethanes, distillate, condensate, and natural gasoline, without any additional processing of any of them, is not considered to be refining.
    
    (c)  No agreement authorized by this chapter may provide for the cooperative marketing of crude petroleum, condensate, distillate, or gas, or any by-products of them.

    Sec. 101.018.  EFFECT OF APPROVAL OUTSIDE OF UNIT.  The approval of an agreement authorized by this chapter shall not of itself be construed as a finding that operations of a different kind or character in the portion of the field outside of the unit are wasteful or not in the interest of conservation.
