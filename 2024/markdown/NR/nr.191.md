    (b)  If an institution of higher education notifies the committee in a timely manner (as established by the committee's rules) that it protests the proposed designation of a building or land under its control as a landmark, the matter becomes a contested case under the provisions of Sections 12 through 20 of the Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act.  In the conduct of proceedings under the Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act, both the hearing officer in his or her recommendations to the committee and the committee in its determinations of findings of fact and conclusions of law shall consider, in addition to such other objective criteria as the committee may establish pursuant to Section [191.091](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=191.091) of this chapter:
    
    (1)  that the primary mission of institutions of higher education is the provision of educational services to the state's citizens;
    
    (2)  that the authority for expenditure of the portion of the state's resources allocated to institutions of higher education for construction and repair purposes is entrusted to the governing boards of institutions of higher education for the purpose of the furtherance of the primary mission of the respective institutions of higher education;
    
    (3)  whether the benefit to the state from landmark designation outweighs the potential inflexibility of use that may be a consequence of the designation; and
    
    (4)  whether the cost of remodeling and/or restoration that might be required under the permit procedures of the committee if the building were designated as a landmark may be so substantially greater than remodeling under procedures established by law for the review of remodeling projects for higher education buildings not so designated as to impair the proper use of funds designated by the state for educational purposes at the institution.
    
    (c)  If an institution of higher education notifies the committee in a timely manner (as established by the committee's rules) that it protests the terms of a permit proposed to be granted to an institution of higher education under this chapter, the matter becomes a contested case under the provisions of Sections 12 through 20 of the Administrative Procedure and the Texas Register Act.  The hearing officer in his or her recommendations to the committee and the committee in its determination of findings of fact and conclusions of law shall consider:
    
    (1)  that the primary mission of institutions of higher education is the provision of educational services to the state's citizens;
    
    (2)  that the authority for expenditure of the portion of the state's resources allocated to institutions of higher education for construction and repair purposes is entrusted to the governing boards of institutions of higher education for the purpose of the furtherance of the primary mission of the respective institutions of higher education;
    
    (3)  whether the legislature has provided extra funds that may be required to implement any proposed requirements;
    
    (4)  the effect of any proposed requirements on maintenance costs;
    
    (5)  the effect of any proposed requirements on energy costs;  and
    
    (6)  the appropriateness of any proposed permit requirements to the uses to which a public building has been or will be dedicated by the governing board of the institution of higher education.
    
    (d)  Weighing the criteria set forth in Subsections (b) and (c) of this section against the criteria it adopts pursuant to Section [191.092](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=191.092) of this chapter and such criteria as it may adopt with regard to permit requirements, the committee shall designate a building or land under the control of an institution of higher education as a landmark or include a requirement in a permit only if the record before the committee establishes by clear and convincing evidence that such designation or inclusion would be in the public interest.

    (e)  There exist categorical exclusions since many activities conducted on nonfederal public land have little, if any, chance to damage archeological sites, and therefore should not require notification under this section.  The following are categorical exclusions at a minimum:
    
    (1)  water injection into existing oil and gas wells;

    (14)  oil, gas, or other mineral exploration, production, processing, marketing, refining, or transportation facility or pipeline project in an area where the project will cross state or local public roads, rivers, and streams, unless they contain a recorded archeological site or a designated state land tract in Texas' submerged lands;
    
    (15)  maintenance, operation, replacement, or minor modification of an existing oil, gas, or other mineral exploration, production, processing, marketing, refining, or transportation facility or pipeline;  and
    
    (16)  any project for which a state permit application has been made prior to promulgation of rules under this section.
    
    (f)  This section does not apply to any state agency or political subdivision that has entered into a memorandum of understanding for coordination with the committee.
    
    (g)(1) If, during the course of a project or class of projects that have complied with the notification requirements of this section, a person encounters an archeological site, the person shall abate activity on the project at the project location and shall promptly notify the committee.
