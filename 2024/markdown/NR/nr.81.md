    (c)  The authority of a municipality or other political subdivision to regulate an oil and gas operation is expressly preempted, except that a municipality may enact, amend, or enforce an ordinance or other measure that: 
    
    (1)  regulates only aboveground activity related to an oil and gas operation that occurs at or above the surface of the ground, including a regulation governing fire and emergency response, traffic, lights, or noise, or imposing notice or reasonable setback requirements;

    (3)  does not effectively prohibit an oil and gas operation conducted by a reasonably prudent operator; and
    
    (4)  is not otherwise preempted by state or federal law.
    
    (d)  An ordinance or other measure is considered prima facie to be commercially reasonable if the ordinance or other measure has been in effect for at least five years and has allowed the oil and gas operations at issue to continue during that period.

    (1)  $10,000 a day for each violation that is not related to pipeline safety; or
    
    (2)  $200,000 a day for each violation that is related to pipeline safety.

    (d)  The commission by rule shall adopt guidelines to be used in determining the amount of the penalty for a violation of a provision of this title or a rule, order, license, permit, or certificate that relates to pipeline safety.  The guidelines shall include a penalty calculation worksheet that specifies the typical penalty for certain violations, circumstances justifying enhancement of a penalty and the amount of the enhancement, and circumstances justifying a reduction in a penalty and the amount of the reduction.  The guidelines shall take into account:
    
    (1)  the permittee's history of previous violations, including the number of previous violations;
    
    (2)  the seriousness of the violation and of any pollution resulting from the violation;
