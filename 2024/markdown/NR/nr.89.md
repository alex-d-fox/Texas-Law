    SUBCHAPTER A. GENERAL PROVISIONS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 89.001.  POLICY.  The conservation and development of all the natural resources of this state are declared to be a public right and duty.  It is also declared that the protection of water and land of the state against pollution or the escape of oil or gas is in the public interest.  In the exercise of the police power of the state, it is necessary and desirable to provide additional means so that wells that are drilled for the exploration, development, or production of oil or gas, or as injection or salt water disposal wells, and that have been abandoned and are leaking salt water, oil, gas, or other deleterious substances into freshwater formations or on the surface of the land, may be plugged, replugged, or repaired by or under the authority and direction of the commission.

    (D)  places the well in compliance with commission rules.
    
    (3)  "Nonoperator" means a person who owns a working interest in a well at the time the well is required to be plugged pursuant to commission rules and is not an operator as defined in Subdivision (2) of this subsection.
    
    (4)  "Commission" means the Railroad Commission of Texas.
    
    (5)  "Well-site equipment" means any production-related equipment or materials specific to the well being plugged, including motors, pumps, pump jacks, tanks, tank batteries, separators, compressors, casing, tubing, and rods.
    
    (6)  "Lease" means the lease on which a well made the subject of a plugging contract is located.
    
    (7)  "Delinquent inactive well" means an inactive well for which, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, the commission has not extended the plugging deadline.
    
    (8)  "Plugging" includes replugging.
    
    (9)  "Cost calculation for plugging an inactive well" means the commission's calculated cost for each foot of well depth plugged based on average actual plugging costs for wells reported by the commission for the preceding state fiscal year for the commission oil and gas division district in which the inactive well is located.
    
    (10)  "Enhanced oil recovery project":
    
    (A)  means:

    (iii)  any other project approved by the commission for enhanced oil recovery; and
    
    (B)  does not include a water disposal project.
    
    (11)  "Good faith claim" means a factually supported claim based on a recognized legal theory to a continuing possessory right in a mineral estate, such as evidence of a currently valid oil and gas lease or a recorded deed conveying a fee interest in the mineral estate.
    
    (12)  "Inactive well" means an unplugged well that has had no reported production, disposal, injection, or other permitted activity for a period of greater than 12 months.
    
    (13)  "Physically terminated electric service to the well's production site" means that electric service to an inactive well site has been disconnected at a point on the electric service lines most distant from the production site toward the main supply line in a manner that will not interfere with electrical supply to adjacent operations, including cathodic protection units.
    
    (b)  The terms operator and nonoperator as defined in this section do not mean a royalty interest owner or an overriding royalty interest owner.

    SUBCHAPTER B. DUTY TO PLUG WELLS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 89.011.  DUTY OF OPERATOR.  (a)  The operator of a well shall properly plug the well when required and in accordance with the commission's rules that are in effect at the time of the plugging.
    
    (b)  If useable quality water zones are present, the operator shall verify the placement of the plug at the base of the deepest fresh water zone required to be protected.  The well is considered to have been properly plugged only when the verification is satisfactory and meets commission requirements.
    
    (c)  If, for the use of the surface owner, the operator of the well plugs the well back to produced fresh water, the duty of the operator to properly plug the well ends only when:
    
    (1)  the well has been properly plugged in accordance with commission requirements;  and
    
    (2)  the surface owner has obtained a permit for the well from the groundwater conservation district, if applicable.
    
    (d)  Subsections (b) and (c) apply only to wells plugged on or after the effective date of this Act.
    
    (e)  The duty of a person to plug an unplugged well that has ceased operation ends only if the person's interest in the well is sold or conveyed while the well is in compliance with rules of the commission relating to safety or the prevention or control of pollution and the provisions of Sections [89.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=89.002)(a)(2)(A)-(D) have been met.  The person acquiring the seller's interest through such a sale or conveyance succeeds the seller as the operator of the well for the purpose of plugging responsibility once the provisions of Sections [89.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=89.002)(a)(2)(A)-(D) have been met.

If the authorized commission employee or designated person determines that the organization report does not qualify for renewal because the operator has continued to fail to comply with the requirements of this subchapter, the operator, not later than the 30th day after the date of the determination, may request a hearing regarding the determination.  The operator shall pay the costs associated with a hearing requested under this subsection.
    
    (f)  If the commission determines following the hearing that the operator has failed to comply with the requirements of this subchapter or the operator fails to file a timely request for a hearing, the commission by order shall refuse to renew the organization report.  The organization report remains in effect until the commission's order becomes final.

    (b)  The owner of an interest in the surface estate of a tract of land on which an orphaned well is located may contract with a commission-approved well plugger to plug the well.
    
    (c)  If the surface estate owner enters into a contract under Subsection (b), the well plugger shall:
    
    (1)  not later than the 30th day before the date the well is plugged, mail notice of its intent to plug the well to the operator of the well at the operator's address as shown by the records of the commission;
    
    (2)  assume responsibility for the physical operation and control of the well as shown by a form the person files with the commission and the commission approves;
    
    (3)  file a bond, letter of credit, or cash deposit covering the well as required by Section [91.107](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=91.107); and
    
    (4)  plug the well in accordance with commission rules.
    
    (d)  On successful plugging of the well by the well plugger, the surface estate owner may submit documentation to the commission of the cost of the well-plugging operation.  The commission shall reimburse the surface estate owner from money in the oil and gas regulation and cleanup fund in an amount not to exceed 50 percent of the lesser of:
    
    (1)  the documented well-plugging costs; or
    
    (2)  the average cost incurred by the commission in the preceding 24 months in plugging similar wells located in the same general area.
    
    (e)  The commission shall adopt any rules reasonably necessary to implement this section.

    SUBCHAPTER D. COSTS OF PLUGGING WELLS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 89.081.  CAUSE OF ACTION FOR DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF COST.  If an operator or nonoperator owns only a partial interest in the well or oil and gas and the operator or nonoperator pays a larger proportion of the cost of plugging the well than his proportionate interest in the well or oil and gas, he has a cause of action against the other operators and nonoperators for their proportionate shares of the cost of plugging.

    Sec. 89.083.  FIRST LIEN ON EQUIPMENT;  CAUSE OF ACTION IF COMMISSION PLUGS.  (a)  If a well has not been plugged by the deadline for plugging established by commission rules, the state has a first lien, superior to all other preexisting and subsequent liens and security interests, on the operator's and nonoperator's interests in well-site equipment, in the amount of the total costs of removing well-site equipment from the well, plugging the well, and transporting, storing, and disposing of the well-site equipment.
    
    (b)  The lien arises on the date by which the well is required to be plugged under commission rules.
    
    (c)  The lien may be foreclosed by judicial action or commission order at any time after notice and an opportunity for a hearing.  If notice is mailed under Section [89.043](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=89.043) and if the lien is not previously foreclosed, the lien is foreclosed by operation of law on the 15th day after the date the notice is mailed unless the commission has received a valid and timely request for a hearing before that date. The commission is not required to give notice or an opportunity for a hearing to subordinate lienholders or nonoperators before foreclosing the lien.
    
    (d)  The lien is extinguished if the well is plugged or otherwise brought into compliance in accordance with commission rules by any person authorized to do so before the commission enters into a plugging contract.
    
    (e)  The lien is extinguished as to any item of well-site equipment that is lawfully removed by any person other than the operator or a nonoperator pursuant to a lien, lease, judgment, written contract, or security agreement before the commission sends notice under Section [89.043](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=89.043)(c). A person may not remove from an inactive well site any equipment necessary to prevent the well from serving as a conduit for the passage of oil, gas, saltwater, oil and gas wastes, or freshwater from one stratum or formation to another or to the surface or from the surface downward except in the course of plugging in accordance with commission rules.
    
    (f)  If the commission plugs a well under Sections [89.043](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=89.043) through [89.044](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=89.044) of this code, the state has a cause of action for all reasonable expenses incurred in plugging or replugging the well and not recovered under Section [89.085](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=89.085) of this code or through reimbursement to the commission.
    
    (g)  The cause of action is:
    
    (1)  first, against the operator, to be secured by a first lien, superior to all preexisting and subsequent liens and security interests, on the operator's interest in the oil and gas in the land and the fixtures, machinery, and equipment found or used on the land where the well is located;  and
    
    (2)  second, against a nonoperator at the time the well should have been plugged, to be secured by a lien on the nonoperator's interest in the oil and gas in the land.  A nonoperator may be made a party defendant in the suit against the operator.
    
    (h)  The commission:
    
    (1)  by order may require the operator and any nonoperator to reimburse the commission for all reasonable expenses incurred in plugging a well;  or
    
    (2)  may request the attorney general to file suit against the operator and any nonoperator to recover those expenses.
    
    (i)  At the request of the commission, the attorney general may file suit to enforce an order issued by the commission under Subsection (h)(1).
    
    (j)  Money collected in a suit under this section shall be deposited in the oil and gas regulation and cleanup fund.
    
    (k)  A civil action for reimbursement under this section may be brought in Travis County, the county in which the plugged well is located, or the county in which any defendant resides.

    Sec. 89.084.  MONEY PAID COMMISSION BY PRIVATE PERSON.  (a)  The commission may accept money from private persons and use the money to plug or replug a well.
    
    (b)  Paying money to the commission is not an admission that the person paying the money is obligated to plug or replug the well.  Evidence that a person has paid money to the commission is not admissible against the person in a suit in which the person's obligation to plug a well is an issue and introducing the evidence is a compulsory ground for mistrial.

    (1)  entering into a plugging contract that provides that the person plugging or cleaning up pollution, or both, will take title to well-site equipment, hydrocarbons from the well that are stored on the lease, or hydrocarbons recovered during the plugging operation in exchange for a sum of money deducted as a credit from the contract price;  or
    
    (2)  selling the well-site equipment, hydrocarbons from the well that are stored on the lease, or hydrocarbons recovered during the plugging operation at a public auction or a public or private sale.
    
    (b)  The commission shall assign separate costs to:
    
    (1)  removing well-site equipment;
    
    (2)  plugging the well;  and
    
    (3)  transporting, storing, and disposing of the well-site equipment.
    
    (c)  The commission shall dispose of well-site equipment or hydrocarbons under this section at a price or value that reflects the generally recognized market value of the equipment or hydrocarbons, with allowances for physical condition.
    
    (d)  The commission shall deposit money received from the sale of well-site equipment or hydrocarbons under this section to the credit of the oil and gas regulation and cleanup fund.  The commission shall separately account for money and credit received for each well.
    
    (e)  A person who acquires well-site equipment or hydrocarbons under this section by sale or contract receives a clear title, free of all prior legal or equitable claims of whatever nature, whether perfected or inchoate.
    
    (f)  Not later than the 30th day after the date well-site equipment or hydrocarbons are disposed of under this section, the commission shall mail a notice by first class mail to the operator of the well at the address last reported to the commission as required by Section [91.142](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=91.142) of this code and commission rules and, on request, to any lienholder or nonoperator.
    
    (g)  The notice required by Subsection (f) of this section must include:
    
    (1)  the lease name;
    
    (2)  the well number;
    
    (3)  the county in which the well is located;

    (7)  a statement that any person who has a legal or equitable ownership or security interest in the equipment or hydrocarbons that was in existence on the date the commission foreclosed its statutory lien may file a claim with the commission.
    
    (h)  Not later than the 180th day after the date the well-site equipment or hydrocarbons are disposed of under this section, the commission shall publish a notice that states:
    
    (1)  the lease name;

    (i)  The commission shall publish the notice required under Subsection (h) of this section in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the lease is located.  A single notice may contain the information required for more than one well and lease.  A notice given under this section following the plugging of a well may be combined with a notice given under Section [91.115](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=91.115) of this code following the cleanup of a site or facility.

(a)  A person with a legal or equitable ownership or security interest in well-site equipment or hydrocarbons disposed of under Section [89.085](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=89.085) may make a claim against the oil and gas regulation and cleanup fund unless an element of the transaction giving rise to the interest occurs after the commission forecloses its statutory lien under Section [89.083](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=89.083).
    
    (b)  The commission shall adopt a form on which a person may file a sworn claim with the commission.
    
    (c)  A claimant must identify the well-site equipment or hydrocarbons in which the claimant has an interest and state the amount of the property interest as of the date the commission foreclosed its statutory lien under Section [89.083](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=89.083).
    
    (d)  The commission may require a person to include with a claim documentation that substantiates the claim or to disclose whether the claimant was an operator or nonoperator of the well.
    
    (e)  The commission may set a hearing to receive evidence on a claim filed under this section.  The commission shall notify the claimant of the date, time, and place of a hearing.
    
    (f)  If the commission holds a hearing, the commission shall issue:
    
    (1)  a decision on the claim;
    
    (2)  a statement of findings of fact that includes the substance of the evidence heard;  and
    
    (3)  the conclusions of law that support the decision.
    
    (g)  The commission shall consider the validity of claims in the order in which the claims are filed.
    
    (h)  The commission shall suspend an amount of money in the oil and gas regulation and cleanup fund equal to the amount of the claim until the claim is finally resolved.  If the provisions of Subsection (k) prevent suspension of the full amount of the claim, the commission shall treat the claim as two consecutively filed claims, one in the amount of funds available for suspension and the other in the remaining amount of the claim.
    
    (i)  A claim made by or on behalf of the operator or a nonoperator of a well or a successor to the rights of the operator or nonoperator is subject to a ratable deduction from the proceeds or credit received for the well-site equipment to cover the costs incurred by the commission in removing the equipment or hydrocarbons from the well or in transporting, storing, or disposing of the equipment or hydrocarbons.  A claim made by a person who is not an operator or nonoperator is subject to a ratable deduction for the costs incurred by the commission in removing the equipment from the well.  If a claimant is a person who is responsible under law or commission rules for plugging the well or cleaning up pollution originating on the lease or if the claimant owes a penalty assessed by the commission or a court for a violation of a commission rule or order, the commission may recoup from or offset against a valid claim an expense incurred by the oil and gas regulation and cleanup fund that is not otherwise reimbursed or any penalties owed.  An amount recouped from, deducted from, or offset against a claim under this subsection shall be treated as an invalid portion of the claim and shall remain suspended in the oil and gas regulation and cleanup fund in the manner provided by Subsection (j).
    
    (j)  If the commission finds that a claim is valid in whole or in part, the commission shall pay the valid portion of the claim from the suspended amount in the oil and gas regulation and cleanup fund not later than the 30th day after the date of the commission's decision.  If the commission finds that a claim is invalid in whole or in part, the commission shall continue to suspend in the oil and gas regulation and cleanup fund an amount equal to the invalid portion of the claim until the period during which the commission's decision may be appealed has expired or, if appealed, during the period the case is under judicial review.  If on appeal the district court finds the claim valid in whole or in part, the commission shall pay the valid portion of the claim from the suspended amount in the oil and gas regulation and cleanup fund not later than 30 days after the date the court's judgment becomes unappealable.  On the date the commission's decision is not subject to judicial review, the commission shall release from the suspended amount in the oil and gas regulation and cleanup fund the amount of the claim held to be invalid.
    
    (k)  If the aggregate of claims paid and money suspended that relates to well-site equipment or hydrocarbons from a particular well equals the total of the actual proceeds and credit realized from the disposition of that equipment or those hydrocarbons, the oil and gas regulation and cleanup fund is not liable for any subsequently filed claims that relate to the same equipment or hydrocarbons unless and until the commission releases from the suspended amount money derived from the disposition of that equipment or those hydrocarbons.  If the commission releases money, then the commission shall suspend money in the amount of subsequently filed claims in the order of filing.
    
    (l)  A person who informs a potential claimant that the potential claimant may be entitled to file a claim under this section or who files a claim on behalf of a claimant may not contract for or receive from the claimant for services an amount greater than 10 percent of the paid claim.
