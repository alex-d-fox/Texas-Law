    SUBCHAPTER F. LEASE OF HIGHWAY LANDS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 32.201.  PREFERENTIAL RIGHT TO LEASE CERTAIN LAND BY ADJOINING MINERAL OWNER; ALLOCATION AND USE OF PAYMENTS RECEIVED FROM LEASING OF LAND OWNED FOR COUNTY ROAD.  (a)  In this section, "mineral owner" means any person who owns the right to explore for, develop, and produce oil and gas from a tract of land adjoining lands owned by the state that were or may be acquired to construct or maintain a highway, road, street, alley, or other right-of-way.
    
    (b)  Oil and gas under lands owned by the state that were or may be acquired to construct or maintain a highway, road, street, alley, or other right-of-way may be offered for lease under this chapter only after the oil and gas are first offered for lease to the mineral owner of the land adjoining the length of the land to be leased.  The board shall set the terms and conditions of the lease as follows:
    
    (1)  In instances where the adjoining land is covered by an existing oil and gas lease currently in effect, the royalty, bonus, and rental shall be identical to those amounts contained in the lease covering the adjoining land or, in the event there is more than one lease covering adjoining land, shall be no less favorable to the state than the most favorable of such leases.
    
    (2)  In instances where the adjoining land is not covered by an existing oil and gas lease, the royalty, bonus, and rental for the lease shall be as provided in Sections [32.1072](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=32.1072) and [32.1073](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=32.1073) of this code.
    
    (c)  The preferential right of the mineral owner created by Subsection (b) of this section is subject to the following limitations:
    
    (1)  the lease of the oil and gas extends only to the center of the width of the particular highway, road, street, alley, or other right-of-way adjacent to the property in which the lessee is the mineral owner;  and
    
    (2)  the preferential right to lease must be exercised by the mineral owner within 120 days of actual notice of the intention to lease as provided by Subsection (d) of this section.
    
    (d)  Actual notice, describing the land as required by Section [32.204](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=32.204) of this code, has occurred upon mailing of the notice of the intention to lease by registered mail to the last known address of the affected mineral owner or owners, if more than one, as determined from records of the county clerk for the county in which the land to be leased is located.  If the identity or address of a mineral owner is not known, and cannot be located after a diligent search of the records of the county clerk and tax assessor-collector for the county in which the land is located, the actual notice required by Subsection (c) of this section shall be provided by publication.  The notice shall be published in the manner provided in the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure for citation by publication in actions against unknown owners or claimants of interest in the land.  Actual notice has occurred on completion of all procedures required by the Rules of Civil Procedure.
    
    (e)  To exercise the preferential right under this section, the mineral owner must tender to the commissioner the bonus set by the board, together with the appropriate statutory sales fee.  The tender to the commissioner must be made on or before the end of the 120-day period provided by Subsection (c)(2) of this section.
    
    (f)  At any time during the 120-day period a mineral owner may waive his preferential right to lease by providing the General Land Office with a written waiver.  Failure by the mineral owner to exercise his preferential right to lease the land within the 120-day period provided by Subsection (c)(2) of this section, or the filing of a written waiver, results in forfeiture of the preferential right to lease the land.
    
    (g)  If a mineral owner's preferential right is forfeited under this section, the land may be offered for lease by the board directly to an applicant or by sealed bid as provided by this chapter.  The board shall not offer nor accept a price or terms which are less than that offered to the adjoining mineral owner under this section.  If not leased at a public offering within 18 months from the date the lease was offered to the adjoining mineral owner, it shall be reoffered to the mineral owner prior to public offering in accordance with the provisions of this section.
    
    (h)  An adjoining mineral owner shall have the right to seek a judicial determination of the state's title to minerals beneath the adjoining highway right-of-way, and legislative consent to sue the state is hereby granted.  Within 60 days of a final nonappealable judgment finding the state did not have title, or only had partial title, the state shall refund all or the proportionate part of any bonus, rental, royalty, and other consideration to the lessee.  The state's lessee shall pay to the lawful mineral owner the value of any oil and gas produced from or allocated to the minerals upon which the state's title failed.
    
    (i)  Subject to Subsection (j), any payment received from the leasing of oil and gas under lands owned by the state that were or may be acquired by a county to construct a county road shall be deposited to the credit of the county road oil and gas fund as provided by Section [32.2015](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=32.2015).
    
    (j)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a lease of oil and gas under land described by Subsection (i) that is entered into on or after September 1, 2017, must require any payment under the lease to be made directly to the county treasurer, or officer performing the function of that office, in the county in which the land is located, as determined by the commissioner and described in the lease, for deposit to the credit of the county road and bridge fund of the county to be used for the purposes described by Section [32.2015](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=32.2015)(d).  A lessee's obligation to make a payment under this subsection is satisfied by making that payment to the county described in the lease.  This subsection does not create a cause of action for a county to pursue remedies under a lease described by this subsection, and a county is not considered to be a party to such a lease for the purpose of asserting a right granted by the lease or under this subsection.
