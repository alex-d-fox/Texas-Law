    Sec. 121.002.  OWNERSHIP OF ANTHROPOGENIC CARBON DIOXIDE.  (a)  This section does not apply to anthropogenic carbon dioxide injected for the primary purpose of enhanced recovery operations.
    
    (b)  Unless otherwise expressly provided by a contract, bill of sale, deed, mortgage, deed of trust, or other legally binding document or by other law, anthropogenic carbon dioxide stored in a geologic storage facility is considered to be the property of the storage operator or the storage operator's heirs, successors, or assigns.
    
    (c)  Absent a final judgment of wilful abandonment rendered by a court or a regulatory determination of closure or abandonment, anthropogenic carbon dioxide stored in a geologic storage facility is not considered to be the property of the owner of the surface or mineral estate in the land in which the anthropogenic carbon dioxide is stored or of a person claiming under the owner of the surface or mineral estate.
    
    (d)  The owner, as designated by Subsection (b) or (c), of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide stored in a geologic storage facility, or the owner's heirs, successors, or assigns, may produce, take, extract, or otherwise possess anthropogenic carbon dioxide stored in the facility.

    (c-1)  Penalties imposed for violations of commission rules adopted under Section [382.502](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=382.502), Health and Safety Code, shall be deposited to the credit of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide storage trust fund.
    
    (d)  The anthropogenic carbon dioxide storage trust fund may be used by the commission only for:
    
    (1)  permitting, inspecting, monitoring, investigating, recording, and reporting on geologic storage facilities and associated anthropogenic carbon dioxide injection wells;
    
    (2)  long-term monitoring of geologic storage facilities and associated anthropogenic carbon dioxide injection wells;
    
    (3)  remediation of mechanical problems associated with geologic storage facilities and associated anthropogenic carbon dioxide injection wells;
    
    (4)  repairing mechanical leaks at geologic storage facilities;
    
    (5)  plugging abandoned anthropogenic carbon dioxide injection wells used for geologic storage;
    
    (6)  training and technology transfer related to anthropogenic carbon dioxide injection and geologic storage; and
    
    (7)  compliance and enforcement activities related to geologic storage and associated anthropogenic carbon dioxide injection wells.
