    (b)  Each lease shall provide that:
    
    (1)  if, at any time after the expiration of the primary term of a lease that, until being shut in, was being maintained in force and effect, a well capable of producing oil or gas in paying quantities is located on the leased premises but oil or gas is not being produced for lack of suitable production facilities or lack of a suitable market, then the lessee may pay as a shut-in oil or gas royalty an amount equal to double the annual rental provided in the lease but not less than $1,200 a year for each well capable of producing oil or gas in paying quantities.  To be effective, each initial shut-in oil or gas royalty must be paid on or before:  (A) the expiration of the primary term, (B) 60 days after the lessee ceases to produce oil or gas from the leased premises, or (C) 60 days after the lessee completes a drilling or reworking operation in accordance with the lease provisions, whichever date is latest;
    
    (2)  if the shut-in oil or gas royalty is paid, the lease shall be considered to be a producing lease and the payment shall extend the term of the lease for a period of one year from the end of the primary term or from the first day of the month following the month in which production ceased, and, after that, if no suitable production facilities or suitable market for the oil or gas exists, the lessee may extend the lease for four more successive periods of one year by paying the same amount each year on or before the expiration of each shut-in year;
    
    (3)  if, during the period the lease is kept in effect by payment of the shut-in oil or gas royalty, oil or gas is sold and delivered in paying quantities from a well located within 1,000 feet of the leased premises and completed in the same producing reservoir, or in any case in which drainage is occurring, the right to continue to maintain the lease by paying the shut-in oil or gas royalty shall cease, but the lease shall remain effective for the remainder of the year for which the royalty has been paid.  The lessee may maintain the lease for four more successive years by the lessee paying compensatory royalty at the royalty rate provided in the lease of the market value of production from the well causing the drainage or which is completed in the same producing reservoir and within 1,000 feet of the leased premises;
    
    (4)  the compensatory royalty is to be paid monthly to the commissioner beginning on or before the last day of the month following the month in which the oil or gas is produced from the well causing the drainage or that is completed in the same producing reservoir and located within 1,000 feet of the leased premises;
    
    (5)  if the compensatory royalty paid in any 12-month period is in an amount less than the annual shut-in oil or gas royalty, the lessee shall pay an amount equal to the difference within 30 days from the end of the 12-month period;  and
    
    (6)  none of these provisions will relieve the lessee of the obligation of reasonable development nor the obligation to drill offset wells as provided in Section [52.034](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=52.034) of this code;  however, at the determination of the commissioner and with the commissioner's written approval, the payment of compensatory royalties shall satisfy the obligation to drill offset wells.

    (b)  If the litigation is instituted during the primary term of the lease, then, after a final, nonappealable judgment is entered in the litigation, the primary term provided in the lease shall resume and the lease shall continue to run for the remainder of the period specified in the lease, and all conditions and covenants contained in the lease shall be operative.

    Sec. 52.0301.  SUSPENSION OF TERMS OF LEASE IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS.  (a)  If the lessee of a valid oil and gas lease granted by the state is unable to obtain access to the leased premises, or is unable to obtain in a timely manner a permit to drill on or produce from the leased premises by any duly constituted authority of the United States or of this state after a diligent, good faith attempt has been made by the lessee to obtain access to, or a permit to drill on or produce from, the leased premises, the lessee may file with the board an application describing and giving the date of the action that deprives the lessee of access to or a permit to drill on or produce from the leased premises.
    
    (b)  If the board is satisfied that the facts included in the application are true and that the lessee acted diligently and in good faith in an attempt to gain access to or the right to drill on or produce from the leased premises, the board may order the suspension of the lease or any condition or covenant contained in the lease from the date the board determines to be the date the cause for the suspension began, except as otherwise provided by this section.

If the payments in the amount of the annual delay rental are not paid by each anniversary date of the lease, the lease shall not automatically terminate.  However, the amount of the annual delay rental stipulated in the lease due by each anniversary date of the lease during the period of suspension continues to be an obligation and debt owed by the lessee.

    (e)  If the lease is suspended during its primary term, then, when the suspension ends, the primary term provided in the lease shall resume and continue to run for the remainder of the period specified in the lease, and all conditions and covenants contained in the lease shall be operative.
    
    (f)  If the lease is suspended during its secondary term, then, when the suspension ends, the lease and all of the conditions and covenants contained in the lease shall be operative, and the lessee shall have 60 days from the date the suspension ends to produce in paying quantities or to commence drilling or reworking operations on the lease as if production had ceased on that date under Section [52.023](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=52.023) of this code.

    (b)  The commissioner shall by rule set the date for making royalty payments and for filing any reports, documents, or other records required to be filed by the commissioner.  However, the commissioner may not set the due date for royalty on oil before the 5th day of the second month succeeding the month of production and may not set the due date for royalty on gas before the 15th day of the second month succeeding the month of production.
    
    (c)  Royalty payments shall be accompanied by:
    
    (1)  an affidavit of the owner, manager, or other authorized agent, completed in the form and manner required by the land office and showing the gross amount and disposition of all oil and gas produced and the market value of the oil and gas;
    
    (2)  a copy of all documents, records, or reports required by the land office, confirming the gross production, disposition, and market value, including gas meter readings, pipeline receipts, gas line receipts, and other checks or memoranda of amount produced and put into pipelines, tanks, pools, and gas lines or gas storage;
    
    (3)  a check stub, schedule, summary, or other remittance advice showing by the assigned land office lease number the amount of royalty being paid on each lease;  and
    
    (4)  other reports or records that the land office may require to verify the gross production, disposition, and market value.
    
    (d)  The lessee has the responsibility for paying royalties or having royalties paid by the date provided for payment in this section.
    
    (e)  If any royalty is not paid when due but is paid before the 31st day after the date on which it is due, a penalty of five percent of the royalty due shall be added to the unpaid amount due.  If the royalty is not paid before the 31st day after the date on which it is due, a penalty of an additional five percent of the royalty due shall be imposed.  The minimum penalty under this section is $25.  The penalty may not be imposed in cases of title dispute as to the state's portion of the royalty or to that portion of the royalty in dispute as to the market value of the production.
    
    (f)  The commissioner shall add a penalty of 25 percent to any delinquent royalty if a part of the delinquency is due to fraud or an intent to evade the provisions of this chapter.
    
    (g)  The annual interest rate on delinquent royalties is 12 percent.  Interest accrues on delinquent royalties beginning 60 days after the date on which the royalty is due.
    
    (h)  If any report, affidavit, supporting document, or any other instrument required to be filed under this chapter is not filed when due, the commissioner shall charge a reasonable penalty in an amount established by rule adopted by the commissioner.
    
    (i)  Interest charged under Subsection (g) of this section or penalties under Subsection (e), (f), or (h) of this section are in addition to any other right, including forfeiture, that the commissioner may exercise for failure to submit a report or other instrument.
    
    (j)  By rule, the board may provide procedures and standards for reduction of interest charged or penalties assessed under this section or any other interest or penalties assessed by the commissioner relating to unpaid or delinquent royalties.

    Sec. 52.173.  OFFSET WELLS.  (a)  In this section:
    
    (1)  "Horizontal drainhole well" means a well with a horizontal drainhole that may produce oil or gas along at least 100 feet of the drainhole.
    
    (2)  "Take point" means any point in a horizontal drainhole well where oil or gas can be produced from the reservoir or field interval recognized by the Railroad Commission of Texas.
    
    (3)  "Unconventional fracture treated field" means an oil or gas field in which horizontal well development and hydraulic fracture treatment must be used to recover resources from all or part of the field.
    
    (a-1)  Except as provided by Subsection (a-2), if oil or gas is produced in commercial quantities within 1,000 feet of land subject to this subchapter or if production of oil or gas is draining land subject to this subchapter, the owner, lessee, sublessee, receiver, or other agent in control of land subject to this subchapter shall in good faith begin the drilling of a well or wells upon such state land within 100 days after the draining well or wells or the well or wells completed within 1,000 feet of the state land commence to produce in commercial quantities and shall prosecute such drilling with diligence to reasonably develop the state land and to protect such state land against drainage.
    
    (a-2)  If the well producing oil or gas in commercial quantities under Subsection (a-1) is a horizontal drainhole well located in an unconventional fracture treated field, the owner, lessee, sublessee, receiver, or other agent in control of land subject to this subchapter is not required to drill an offset well as provided by Subsection (a-1) unless any take point in the horizontal drainhole well is located closer to the state land than the greater of:
    
    (1)  the minimum distance established by the applicable lease-line spacing requirement of the Railroad Commission of Texas; or
    
    (2)  a perpendicular distance of 330 feet.
    
    (b)  An offset well shall be drilled to a depth and the means shall be employed which may be necessary to prevent undue drainage of oil or gas from beneath the state land.
    
    (c)  Within 30 days after an offset well has been completed or abandoned, a log of each well shall be filed in the land office.
    
    (d)  At the determination of the commissioner and with the commissioner's written approval, the payment of a compensatory royalty shall satisfy the obligation to drill an offset well or wells required by Subsection (a-1).  Such compensatory royalty shall be paid at a royalty rate established by the commissioner if the land is unleased, or at the royalty rate provided by the state lease, if the land is leased.  Such compensatory royalty shall be paid on the market value at the well of production from the well producing oil or gas in commercial quantities described by Subsection (a-1).

    Sec. 52.174.  FAILURE TO DRILL OFFSET.  If such persons fail or refuse to begin the drilling of such well or wells within the time required or to prosecute such drilling as necessary for the purpose intended herein, any lease of such land executed under the provisions of this law shall be subject to forfeiture by the Commissioner of the General Land Office, and he shall forfeit same when he is sufficiently informed of the facts which authorize a forfeiture, and shall, on the wrapper containing the papers relating to such lease, write and sign officially words declaring such forfeiture, and the lease and all rights thereunder shall thereupon be forfeited together with all payments made thereunder.  Notice of such action shall forthwith be mailed to the persons shown by the records of the General Land Office to be the owners of the surface and the owners of the forfeited lease at their last known addresses as shown by the records of said office.  Upon proper showing by the owner of the forfeited lease within 30 days after the declaration of forfeiture, the lease may, at the discretion of the commissioner and upon the terms of this subchapter and such other terms as he may prescribe, be reinstated.  If such lease be not reinstated within such time, or if the commissioner finds that any unleased land included in this law is being drained, the commissioner shall notify the person at his last known address, as shown by records of the General Land Office to be the surface owner, that the oil and gas is subject to sale or lease by the owner of the soil in accordance with this law, and that drilling is required.  If such owner shall fail or refuse to obtain the commencement of such a well within 100 days after the date of such notice, the relinquishment herein granted and the rights acquired thereunder shall be subject to forfeiture by the commissioner by endorsing on the file wrapper containing the papers relating to the sale of the land, words indicating such forfeiture, and such rights shall thereupon be forfeited, and notice of such forfeiture shall be forwarded to the county clerk of the county wherein the land is situated.  The rights of any owner of the soil which may have ipso facto terminated under prior laws shall be reinstated and are hereby reinstated, together with all rights acquired thereunder except where rights of third parties may have intervened.  All rights herein reinstated shall be subject to the terms and provisions of this subchapter.

    Sec. 52.175.  LEASE OF OIL AND GAS AFTER FORFEITURE.  When the relinquishment or agency right herein granted has been forfeited, the land shall be subject to lease for oil and gas under the procedure provided by law for the leasing of unsold surveyed public school lands.  The substantive provisions of Subchapter B of this chapter  and Subchapters D and E, Chapter [32](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=32), of this code  shall apply to the oil and gas lease.  No oil and gas lease shall be executed which provides for a royalty of less than one-eighth, payable to the state for the benefit of the permanent free school fund.  The owner of the soil shall not be entitled to any revenue generated by a lease executed pursuant to this section.  Upon the termination or expiration of a lease so executed by the Commissioner of the General Land Office, the rights of the surface owner to act under this law shall be ipso facto reinstated.

If one acquires a valid right by permit or lease to the oil and gas in any unsold public free school or asylum land under any other law, a subsequent purchaser of such land shall not acquire any rights to any of the oil and gas that may be therein, but when the rights under such permit or lease terminate in the manner provided in the law under which they were obtained, then the owner of the soil shall become the owner of that portion of the oil and gas herein relinquished, and shall be thereafter subject to the provisions of this law.  A forfeiture of the purchase of any survey or tract for any cause shall operate as a forfeiture of the minerals therein to the state.  A relinquishment to the state of a lease producing oil or gas in paying quantities shall not operate to relinquish or convey to the owner of the soil any interest whatever in the oil and gas that may be in the land included in said lease.

The drilling on one permit shall be sufficient protection against forfeiture of all the permits included in a combination.  Owners of permits or combination of permits included herein shall have three years after the date or average date thereof in which to complete the development of oil and gas thereon, and if oil and gas should not be found in paying quantities and a lease applied for within said time all rights in such permit or combination of permits shall terminate, and the oil and gas in such land shall become subject to the provisions of this law relating to the relinquishment of oil and gas to the owner of the soil.

A failure to make either of said payments shall subject the permit or permits to forfeiture by the commissioner, and when sufficiently informed of the facts which subject the permits to forfeiture, said commissioner shall forfeit the same by an endorsement of forfeiture upon the wrapper containing the papers relating to the permits and sign it officially.  The payment of 10 cents per acre to the owner of the soil may be made to him or to the county clerk of the county in which the land is situated, and said clerk shall deposit such payment as he receives, in some bank at the county seat to the credit of the record owner of such land.  If the owner of the soil refuses to accept such payment, said clerk shall withdraw such deposit and return it to the owner of the permit.  The payment, or the tender of payment, shall be evidenced by the receipt of the owner or part owner or county clerk filed among the papers in the land office relating to such permits.

The substantive provisions of Subchapter B  of this chapter and Subchapters D  and E, Chapter [32](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=32), of this code shall apply to a lease of land subject to lease under this subchapter.  The substantive provisions of Subchapter [E](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=53.151), Chapter [53](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=53), of this code and Subchapters D and E, Chapter [32](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=32), of this code shall apply to a lease of land subject to lease under Subchapter [C](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=53.061), Chapter [53](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=53), of this code.  Subject to the provisions of Subsection (b)(4) of this section, the owner of the soil shall not be entitled to any revenue generated by a lease executed pursuant to this section.
    
    (b)  An owner of the soil or of an undivided interest therein may be found to be unavailable to act as the state's agent for leasing oil and gas or any mineral leased under Subchapter [C](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=53.061), Chapter [53](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=53), of this code, if the following conditions have been satisfied:
    
    (1)  Any party who has been unable to locate an owner of any interest, including an undivided interest, in the surface of land subject to this subchapter or Subchapter [C](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=53.061), Chapter [53](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=53), of this code must submit a written affidavit to the commissioner stating that the party (hereafter called affiant) has been unable to locate said owner.  This affidavit must specify the legal description of the land which the affiant has been unable to lease and the extent of the interest and type of mineral which the affiant has been unable to lease.  In the affidavit, the affiant must also attest to the fact that he diligently searched the county clerk's records and the tax assessor's records to determine the name, identity, and last known place of residence of the owner of the soil who could lease the interest that the affiant has been unable to lease.  The affiant must further attest to the results of his search of such records and to any other steps taken to locate the owner of the soil.
    
    (2)  The commissioner shall provide notice to any owner of the soil identified by the affiant in Subdivision (1) of this subsection of the consequences of a finding that such owner of the soil is unavailable to act as the state's leasing agent.  Such notice shall be in writing to the owner of the soil's last known address and shall also be provided by publication in the manner provided by the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure for citation by publication in actions against unknown owners or claimants of an interest in land.
    
    (3)  If the owner of the soil has not contacted the commissioner within 30 days after the completion of all notice procedures provided under Subdivision (2) of this subsection, then the owner of the soil will be deemed unavailable to act as the state's leasing agent and the School Land Board may lease the state's mineral interest under Subsection (a) of this section.  However, if prior to the execution of a lease under Subsection (a) the owner of the soil notifies the commissioner in writing that he can and will act as the state's agent, then the owner of the soil's ability to act as a leasing agent under this subchapter or under Subchapter [C](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=53.061), Chapter [53](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=53), of this code shall be reinstated.
    
    (4)  If the owner of the soil or of any undivided interest therein appears within two years after the execution of a lease on his land pursuant to this section, he shall be entitled to one-half of all royalties theretofore paid or thereafter to be paid under such lease, reduced in the proportion which his interest bears to the whole and undivided surface estate, upon showing to the satisfaction of the commissioner that the information submitted under Subsection (b)(1) was inaccurate or that a reasonably diligent search would have resulted in his being located.
    
    (c)  Upon the termination or expiration of a lease for oil and gas or any mineral leased under Subchapter [C](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=53.061), Chapter [53](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=53), of this code executed pursuant to this section, the rights of the owner of the soil to act under this subchapter shall be ipso facto reinstated.

    Sec. 52.188.  ASSIGNMENTS TO THE OWNER OF THE SOIL.  (a)  An owner of the soil may acquire by assignment a lease which he executed on land subject to the Relinquishment Act, Subchapter [F](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=52.171), Chapter [52](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=52) of this code;  however, such an assignment is subject to the terms of this section.
    
    (b)  When an owner of the soil seeks an assignment under Subsection (a) of this section, both the current lessee and the owner of the soil should notify the General Land Office of the proposed assignment.  This notification must include proof of the consideration to be paid for the assignment.  The land commissioner may then approve the assignment;  if the commissioner does approve it, then both the current lessee and the owner of the soil will receive written notice of this approval.  Such written approval shall also become part of the General Land Office's mineral file on this land.
    
    (c)  A lease which has been assigned to an owner of the soil without the advance approval of the land commissioner is void as of the time of assignment.  In addition, the land commissioner may also forfeit the agency powers of the owner of the soil, and the state will execute a subsequent lease pursuant to Section [52.175](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=52.175) of this code.
    
    (d)  Whenever an owner of the soil is assigned a Relinquishment Act lease that he executed, he shall be accountable to the state as follows:
    
    (1)  If the lease was assigned to the owner of the soil without the advance approval of the commissioner and the owner of the soil subsequently assigns the lease, the owner of the soil must pay the state two times the entire consideration that he received upon subsequent assignment of the lease.  Payment of this money in no way alters the fact that the lease is void under Subsection (c) of this section.
    
    (2)  When an assignment to an owner of the soil has the commissioner's advance approval and the owner of the soil subsequently assigns the lease, the owner of the soil must pay the state one-half of his profit on the subsequent assignment.  His profit is the difference between what he paid for his assignment and what he received for the subsequent assignment.
    
    (e)  Under this section, an assignment will be treated as if it were made to the owner of the soil when:
    
    (1)  the assignee is a nominee of the owner of the soil;
    
    (2)  the assignee is a corporation or subsidiary in which the owner of the soil is a principal stockholder or is an employee of such a corporation or subsidiary;

    Sec. 52.189.  AUTHORITY AND DUTIES OF AGENT.  (a)  Prohibition Against Self-Dealing.  (1) The owner of the soil may not lease, either directly or indirectly, to himself or to a nominee, to any corporation or subsidiary in which he is a principal stockholder or to an employee of such a corporation or subsidiary, or to a partnership in which he is a partner or to an employee of such a partnership.  If the owner of the soil is a corporation or a partnership, then the owner of the soil may not lease, either directly or indirectly, to a principal stockholder of the corporation or to a partner of the partnership, or any employee of the corporation or partnership.  The owner of the soil may not lease, either directly or indirectly, to his fiduciary, including but not limited to a guardian, trustee, executor, administrator, receiver, or conservator.
    
    (2)  Except as provided by this section, the owner of the soil may not lease, directly or indirectly, to a person related to him within and including the second degree of consanguinity or affinity, including a person related by adoption, or to a corporation or subsidiary in which that person is a principal stockholder, or to a partnership in which that person is a partner, or to an employee of such a corporation or subsidiary or partnership.
    
    (3)  An owner of the soil who wishes to lease to a person, corporation, or partnership described in Subdivision (2) may request the approval of the board for authority to execute such a lease before its execution.  The owner of the soil requesting approval must also execute and file with the commissioner a sworn affidavit stating that the owner of the soil will not receive any benefit under a lease so approved by the board that will not be shared with the permanent school fund in the proportion prescribed by this subchapter.
    
    (4)  If an owner of the soil makes any material misstatement of fact in connection with an application to the board or affidavit made pursuant to Subdivision (3), then any lease executed pursuant to the authority of the board shall be voidable at the election of the commissioner.  The election to void such a lease shall be cumulative of and in addition to all other remedies available to the commissioner or the state.
    
    (b)  Fiduciary Duty of Agent.  An owner of the soil owes the state a fiduciary duty and a duty of utmost good faith.  An owner of the soil must fully disclose any facts affecting the state's interest and must act in the best interest of the state.  Any conflict of interest must be resolved by putting the interests of the state before the interests of the owner of the soil.  In addition to these specific statutory duties, the owner of the soil owes the state all the common-law duties of a holder of executive rights.
    
    (c)  When the commissioner determines that an owner of the soil has breached any duty or obligation under this subchapter, the commissioner may request that the attorney general file an action or proceeding either to enforce the duties and obligations of the owner of the soil or to forfeit the then applicable agency rights of the surface owner.  Such an action or proceeding shall be filed in a district court in Travis County.
    
    (d)  A penalty of 10 percent shall be imposed on any sums due the state because a surface owner breaches a fiduciary duty.  This penalty shall be applied only to amounts owed as a result of breaches occurring on and after the effective date of this subsection.  The imposition of this penalty will not limit the right of the state to obtain punitive damages, exemplary damages, or interest.  Any punitive damages or exemplary damages assessed by a court shall be offset by the 10 percent penalty imposed by this subsection.

If a lease is not issued, the data shall be returned to the applicant.
    
    (e)  The board may prescribe the form of the application, specify information required to be submitted in support of an application, and, by rule, otherwise provide for the implementation of this section.
    
    (f)  The staff of the land office shall review the information presented in the application, other geological, geophysical, and geochemical data reasonably available to it relevant to the land proposed to be leased, and leasing information reasonably available to it relevant to the land proposed to be leased.  The staff shall prepare a report to the board that contains:
    
    (1)  a summary of bonus, rental, royalty, and other lease terms then being offered and asked for leases of similar lands in the area of the land proposed to be leased;  and

    (g)  The board shall consider the application at a regular meeting.  It may, in its sole discretion, grant or deny the application or grant the application subject to specified conditions.  Such conditions may include a requirement that if the applicant does not materially participate in the exploration or development of the leased premises, through labor performed, cash or goods contributed, or supplying other enhancement in value, the applicant must share equally with the permanent school fund any benefit derived from the lease.
    
    (h)  After the board has approved an application, the commissioner shall issue a lease to the applicant.  The lease shall conform, as nearly as is practicable, to the form of lease prescribed by the board under Section [32.1071](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=32.1071).
    
    (i)  The commissioner may not deliver a lease issued under this section until the applicant has executed and delivered to the commissioner a waiver of the applicant's right and duty to act as agent for the state in leasing the leased premises and to receive any part of the bonus, rental, royalty, and other consideration accruing to the owner of the soil under this subchapter.  The waiver and the lease shall be effective as of the date the commissioner executes the lease.
    
    (j)  Upon the expiration, termination, or forfeiture of a lease issued under this section, the agency rights and duties of the applicant as owner of the soil are reinstated without the necessity for further action by the owner of the soil, the board, or the commissioner.

If the applicant must obtain a lease from an owner of the soil from whom the applicant would otherwise not be permitted to lease in order reasonably to explore for or produce or explore for and produce oil or gas, the commissioner may approve the lease on the condition that the applicant shall not receive any benefit from the lease, and, if the applicant should acquire by any method, including devise or inheritance, the right to receive any rental, royalty, or other benefit accruing to the owner of the soil's interest under the lease, the applicant shall assign the benefit to the commissioner for the benefit of the permanent school fund.
    
    (l)  The commissioner shall not approve any lease obtained by an applicant from another owner of the soil if the lease contains terms that are substantially inconsistent with or provide for a lesser bonus, rental, or royalty than the lease approved by the board.  If the bonus, rental, or royalty in a lease obtained by an applicant from another owner of the soil for a comparable interest is greater than that approved by the board, then the lease approved by the board shall be amended to provide for the greater bonus, rental, or royalty, and the applicant shall be liable for all greater sums due.  In determining whether an interest is comparable, the board shall consider the quantum of the interest, the time at which the lease was taken, and any other aspects of the lease transaction that the board considers to be relevant.
