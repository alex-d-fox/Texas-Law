    Sec. 51.011.  MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC SCHOOL LAND.  (a)  Any land, mineral or royalty interest, or real property holding, and revenue received from any land or real property holding, that is set apart to the permanent school fund under the constitution and laws of this state together with the mineral estate in riverbeds, channels, and the tidelands, including islands, shall be subject to the sole and exclusive management and control of the School Land Board and the commissioner under the provisions of this chapter and other applicable law.
    
    (a-1)  The board may acquire, sell, lease, trade, improve, maintain, protect, or otherwise manage, control, or use land, mineral and royalty interests, or real property holdings, and revenue received from land or real property holdings, that are set apart to the permanent school fund in any manner, at such prices, and under such terms and conditions as the board finds to be in the best interest of the fund.
    
    (a-2)  Not later than October 15 of each year, the board shall report to the Legislative Budget Board the sale of any land that is set apart to the permanent school fund for less than appraised value or the purchase of any land that is set apart to the permanent school fund for more than appraised value during the preceding state fiscal year.
    
    (a-3)  All revenue received from mineral or royalty interests described by Subsection (a), including bonus payments, mineral lease rental revenues, royalties, and any other type of revenue received from those interests, less any amount specified by appropriation to be retained by the board under this subsection, shall be transferred each month to the Texas Permanent School Fund Corporation for investment in the permanent school fund.
    
    (b)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, land within 2,500 feet of a military base may not be sold or leased and an easement over the land may not be granted unless the commissioner or the commissioner's designee, after consultation with appropriate military authorities, determines that the grant will not adversely affect the mission of the military base.
    
    (c)  Any public land may be sold or leased, or an easement over the property may be granted, to the United States for the use and benefit of the United States armed forces if the commissioner or the commissioner's designee, after consultation with appropriate military authorities, determines that the sale, lease, or easement would materially assist the military in accomplishing its mission.  A sale, lease, or easement under this subsection must be at market value.  The state shall retain all minerals it owns with respect to the land, but it may relinquish the right to use the surface to extract them.
    
    (d)  The commissioner shall determine whether a conveyance under this section takes priority over any preference otherwise granted by law, including the preferential right of a surrounding landowner.  In making the determination, the commissioner must only consider the interests of preference holders who assert their preferences in writing after notice of the proposed conveyance is published in a newspaper of general circulation in the area.  The commissioner shall, in the commissioner's discretion, balance the competing interests of the preference holders and the military.  The commissioner's determination is final.  After land is conveyed to the military, all competing preferences terminate.

    Sec. 51.188.  COMMISSIONER'S FINAL ORDER.  (a)  At any time during or after an investigation of or hearing regarding a vacancy application, the commissioner may determine that land claimed to be vacant is not vacant and issue a final order with a finding of "Not Vacant Land" or an order finding a vacancy if a hearing is not required under Section [51.187](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=51.187).

    (c)  A final order finding a vacancy exists must contain:
    
    (1)  a finding by the commissioner that the land claimed to be vacant is unsurveyed public school land that is not in conflict with land previously titled, awarded, or sold by the state as established by:
    
    (A)  clear and convincing proof for an application to which an exception has been filed as provided by Section [51.182](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=51.182); or

    (d)  In determining the boundaries and size of a vacancy, the commissioner is not restricted to a description of the land claimed to be vacant that is provided by the applicant, the surveyor, or any other person.

If the owner of the land that is the subject of the conflict cannot obtain the patent, he shall return to the commissioner legal evidence of his title to the patent or part of the patent.
    
    (b)  The person returning the patent or filing the evidence also shall make and file with the commissioner an affidavit stating that he is still the owner of the land and has not sold or transferred it.
    
    (c)  If the land office records or a duly certified copy of a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that has adjudicated the title reflects that a conflict exists, the commissioner may cancel the patent or the part of a patent that appears to belong to the party making the application.
    
    (d)  In cases where a survey in a block or system of surveys conflicts on one side or more, and omits an unpatented strip on another side or sides due to the patent being issued on an erroneous subsequent survey not conforming to the original and recognized pattern for the block or system, the commissioner, at the request of all parties owning under said patent, may cancel said patent and issue a corrected patent that shall conform to said block or system of surveys.  In the event that excess acreage exists, a deed of acquittance shall be procured, as provided by law, and will be issued simultaneously with the corrected patent.  This Subsection (d) shall not adversely affect the rights of any party in or entitled to possession of land affected by this subsection, but merely clarifies that the ownership in any land in a block or system of surveys exists as if the patent had been correctly issued on the date the erroneous patent was issued.  The rights of a claimant under applicable law shall be construed as if the corrected patent had been originally issued.

    (f)  The trial courts of this state shall give preference to an appeal from a final order of the commissioner under this section as provided by Section [23.101](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=23.101)(a), Government Code.

    (1)  sell salvageable parts or attachments of the facility or structure to offset those costs;
    
    (2)  record a lien, in the total amount of the penalties, costs, and other fees and expenses assessed, against the adjacent littoral property;

The notice of lien must contain a legal description of the adjacent littoral property, the name of the owner of the adjacent littoral property, if known, and the total amount of the penalties, costs, and other fees.
