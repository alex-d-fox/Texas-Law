    Sec. 133.041.  BARRIERS REQUIRED.  (a)  A person responsible for an active pit must construct a barrier or other device required by this code between a public road adjoining the site and a pit, provided the pit is in hazardous proximity to the public road.  
    
    (b)  A person responsible for an abandoned or inactive pit must construct a barrier or other device required by this code between a public road adjoining the site and the pit, provided that the pit is in hazardous proximity to a public road and in an unacceptable unsafe location.  The commission may grant a waiver from the barrier requirement if the person responsible for the abandoned or inactive pit submits an application to the commission showing that:
    
    (1)  a governmental entity obtained a right-of-way and constructed a public road within 200 feet of the abandoned or inactive pit before August 26, 1991;  and
    
    (2)  the pit has remained abandoned or inactive since the road was constructed.
    
    (c)  The responsible party may choose to slope the sidewalls of a pit in place of constructing a berm or barrier, provided that in the opinion of the responsible party such corrective measure better serves the public safety and provided that the slope shall not exceed 30 degrees from the horizontal.
    
    (d)  The barrier or other device must be completed not later than the 90th day after the day on which the person responsible for the quarry or pit receives a notice of approval under Section [133.048](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=133.048)(b) of this code.

    (1)  reach a height that the commission determines that under the circumstances will obstruct, restrain, and prevent the normal passage of vehicular traffic;
    
    (2)  be of substantial construction suitable for impact under normal driving conditions;  and
    
    (3)  have openings to the extent necessary for travel on the premises and for public road drainage, although such drainage paths must be covered with protective material, substantial enough to turn away motor vehicular traffic that normally travels the adjacent public road.
    
    (b)  The commission may not adopt construction standards for barriers under Subsection (a) that are more stringent than the Texas Department of Transportation standards.
    
    (c)  In the event the commission determines that the pit location as detailed in the quarry safety plan or other application will contain substantial soil types of such density and other factors that will have a high probability of holding or impounding water, when the pit is operating, inactive, or abandoned, wherein the impoundment of water poses a definite and determinable unreasonable risk to human health and safety as set out in this code, the commission may require the responsible party operating soil, dirt, clay, gravel, sand, caliche and clay pits to slope the sidewalls as an additional requirement to obtain a safety certificate or to alter the berm or barrier.

    (c)  The quarry safety plan must:
    
    (1)  set out the information required in Section [133.046](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=133.046) et seq. of this code;  and

    (4)  provided, however, that the person responsible must have received a notice from the commission that the quarry or pit requires the operator to obtain a safety certificate, before that person is prohibited from operating or maintaining the quarry or pit without a safety certificate.
    
    (c)  Any person responsible who, on November 1, 1991, is utilizing a portion of a site for quarrying operations, including the stockpiling, sale, or processing of aggregates or a combination thereof, or who has a current, valid, or outstanding agreement or legal right to develop, utilize, or quarry the property, shall be responsible for obtaining a safety certificate limited to that specific pit area he is using or excavating or intends to use or excavate.
    
    (d)  A person responsible for a quarry or pit may operate the pit during a period that is described by Subsection (a) or (c) of Section [133.052](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=133.052) of this code.
