    Sec. 61.015.  BEACH ACCESS AND USE PLANS.  (a)  Each local government with ordinance authority over construction adjacent to public beaches and each county that contains any area of public beach within its boundaries shall adopt a plan for preserving and enhancing access to and use of public beaches within the jurisdiction of the local government.  Such beach access and use plans must be consistent with the policies in Section [61.011](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=61.011) of this code and the rules promulgated thereunder and Chapter [63](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=63) of this code and shall to the greatest extent practicable incorporate the local government's ordinary land use planning procedures.  A municipality may adopt and apply any appropriate ordinances within its extraterritorial jurisdiction to effect the purposes of this subchapter.
    
    (b)  Local governments shall submit proposed beach access and use plans to the commissioner for certification as to compliance with such policies and rules. The commissioner shall act on a local government's proposed beach access and use plan within 90 days of submission by either approving the plan or denying certification.  In the event of denial, the commissioner shall send the proposed plan back to the originating local government with a statement of specific objections and the reasons for denial, along with suggested modifications.  On receipt, the local government shall revise and resubmit the plan.  The commissioner's certification of local government plans shall be by adoption into the rules under Section [61.011](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=61.011).
    
    (c)  A littoral owner proposing construction adjacent to and landward of a public beach in the area described in Section [61.011](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=61.011)(d)(6) shall submit a development plan to the appropriate local government.  The local government shall forward a development plan for small-scale construction activity that includes 5,000 square feet or less or habitable structures two stories or less in height to the commissioner no less than 10 working days prior to acting on the development plan.  The local government shall forward a development plan for large-scale construction activity that includes more than 5,000 square feet or habitable structures more than two stories in height to the commissioner no less than 30 working days prior to acting on the development plan.  The commissioner may submit comments on the proposed construction to the local government.
    
    (d)  The local government shall review the proposed development plan and the commissioner's comments and other information the local government may consider useful to determine consistency with the local government's beach access and use plan.
    
    (e)  If the proposed construction is required to be permitted by the local government under Chapter [63](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=63) of this code, the local government shall consider the issuance of the permit concurrently with the certification under this section, unless otherwise provided by rules promulgated under Section [61.011](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=61.011) of this code.
    
    (f)  The local government, after considering all appropriate information, shall make the determination and shall certify that the construction as proposed either is consistent with the local government's beach access and use plan or is inconsistent with the local government's beach access and use plan, in which case the local government must specify how the construction is inconsistent with the plan.
    
    (g)  The local government may include in the certification any reasonable terms and conditions it finds necessary to assure adequate public beach access and use rights consistent with Chapter [63](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=63) of this code.
    
    (h)  The requirements of this section take effect only on adoption of final rules by the commissioner under Section [61.011](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=61.011) of this code.

    Sec. 61.016.  BOUNDARIES FOR AREAS WITH NO MARKED VEGETATION LINE.  (a)  To determine the "line of vegetation" in any area of public beach in which there is no clearly marked line of vegetation (for instance, a line immediately behind well-defined dunes or mounds of sand and at a point where vegetation begins) recourse shall be to the nearest clearly marked line of vegetation on each side of the unmarked area.
    
    (b)  The "line of vegetation" for the unmarked area shall be the line of constant elevation connecting the two clearly marked lines of vegetation on each side.
    
    (c)  If the elevation of the two points on each side of the area are not the same, the extension defining the "line of vegetation" shall be the average elevation as between the two points, but if there is no clearly marked line of vegetation, the "line of vegetation" shall not extend inland further than 200 feet from the seaward line of mean low tide.
    
    (d)  The "line of vegetation" is dynamic and may move landward or seaward due to the forces of erosion or natural accretion. For the purposes of determining the public beach easement, if the "line of vegetation" is obliterated due to a meteorological event, the landward boundary of the area subject to the public easement shall be the line established by order under Section [61.0171](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=61.0171)(a) or as determined by the commissioner under Section [61.0171](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=61.0171)(f).

    Sec. 61.017.  LINE OF VEGETATION UNAFFECTED BY CERTAIN CONDITIONS.  (a)  The "line of vegetation" is not affected by the occasional sprigs of salt grass on mounds and dunes or seaward from them or by artificial fill, the addition or removal of turf, beach nourishment projects or artificial placement of dredged or fill material, whether conducted by public or private entities, or other artificial changes in the natural vegetation of the area.
    
    (b)  If the changes listed in Subsection (a) of this section are made and the vegetation line is obliterated or is created artificially, the line of vegetation shall be determined in the same manner as in those areas covered by Section [61.016](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=61.016) of this code, but if there is a vegetation line consistently following a line more than 200 feet from the seaward line of mean low tide, the 200-foot line shall constitute the landward boundary of the area subject to public easement until a final court adjudication establishes the line in another place.
    
    (c)(1) In an area of public beach where a seawall structure constructed in its entirety as a single structure of one design before 1970 and continuously maintained with a height of not less than 11 feet above mean low tide interrupts the natural line of vegetation for a distance not less than 4,000 feet nor greater than 4,500 feet, the line of vegetation is along the seaward side of the seawall for the distance marked by the seawall, provided that prior to September 2, 1997:
    
    (A)  a perpetual easement has been granted in favor of the public affording pedestrian, noncommercial use along and over the entire length of the seawall and adjacent sidewalk by the general public;
    
    (B)  fee title to the surface estate to an area for public parking and other public uses adjacent to the seawall has been conveyed to and accepted by a public entity, which area contains sufficient acreage to provide at least one parking space for each 15 linear feet of the seawall, is located within the center one-third of the length of the seawall or not farther than 300 feet from that center one-third, and has frontage on the seawall for at least 300 linear feet;  and
    
    (C)  permanent roadway easements exist within 1,000 feet of each end of the seawall affording vehicular access from the nearest public road to the beach.
    
    (2)  A line of vegetation established as described in this subsection shall be the landward boundary of the public beach and of the public easement for all purposes.  Fee title to all submerged land as described in this code shall remain in the State of Texas.
    
    (d)(1) In an area of public beach where a combination stone revetment and concrete sheet pile wall constructed in its entirety as a single structure before 1999 and continuously maintained with a height of not less than five feet above mean low tide interrupts the natural line of vegetation for a distance not less than 7.5 miles and not more than 8.5 miles, the line of vegetation is along the landward boundary of that strip of land conveyed to the United States of America for the construction of the stone revetment and concrete sheet pile wall and for the distance marked by the stone revetment and concrete sheet pile wall.
    
    (2)  A line of vegetation established as described by this subsection is the landward boundary of the public beach and of the public easement for all purposes.  Fee title to all submerged land as described in this code shall remain in the State of Texas.
    
    (e)  In an area of public beach where a shore protection structure constructed as provided by Section [61.022](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=61.022)(a)(6) interrupts the natural line of vegetation for a distance of at least 1,000 feet, the line of vegetation is along the seaward side of the shore protection structure for the distance marked by that structure.  A line of vegetation established under this subsection is the landward boundary of the public beach and of the public easement for all purposes, provided that before or concurrently with the construction of the structure:
    
    (1)  a perpetual easement has been granted in favor of the public affording pedestrian, noncommercial use along and over the entire length of the structure and an adjacent sidewalk by the general public; and
    
    (2)  the subdivision that constructed the shore protection structure has provided a public parking area of sufficient acreage to provide at least one parking space for each 15 linear feet of the structure, located so that ingress and egress ways are not more than one-half mile apart.
    
    (f)  Before a subdivision of this state begins construction of a shore protection structure described by Subsection (e), the subdivision must conduct and obtain the commissioner's approval of a coastal boundary survey under Section [33.136](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=33.136).  The state retains fee title to all land described by Section [11.012](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=11.012) that is occupied by or affected by the placement of the structure.

    DISCLOSURE NOTICE CONCERNING LEGAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS
    
      
    
    
    OF PURCHASING COASTAL REAL PROPERTY NEAR A BEACH
    
      
    
    
    WARNING:  THE FOLLOWING NOTICE OF POTENTIAL RISKS OF ECONOMIC LOSS TO YOU AS THE PURCHASER OF COASTAL REAL PROPERTY IS REQUIRED BY STATE LAW.
    
    ●    READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY.  DO NOT SIGN THIS CONTRACT UNTIL YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND THE RISKS YOU ARE ASSUMING.
    
    ●    BY PURCHASING THIS PROPERTY, YOU MAY BE ASSUMING ECONOMIC RISKS OVER AND ABOVE THE RISKS INVOLVED IN PURCHASING INLAND REAL PROPERTY.
    
    ●    IF YOU OWN A STRUCTURE LOCATED ON COASTAL REAL PROPERTY NEAR A GULF COAST BEACH, IT MAY COME TO BE LOCATED ON THE PUBLIC BEACH BECAUSE OF COASTAL EROSION AND STORM EVENTS.
    
    ●    AS THE OWNER OF A STRUCTURE LOCATED ON THE PUBLIC BEACH, YOU COULD BE SUED BY THE STATE OF TEXAS AND ORDERED TO REMOVE THE STRUCTURE.
    
    ●    THE COSTS OF REMOVING A STRUCTURE FROM THE PUBLIC BEACH AND ANY OTHER ECONOMIC LOSS INCURRED BECAUSE OF A REMOVAL ORDER WOULD BE SOLELY YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.
    
    The real property described in this contract is located seaward of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway to its southernmost point and then seaward of the longitudinal line also known as 97 degrees, 12', 19" which runs southerly to the international boundary from the intersection of the centerline of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and the Brownsville Ship Channel.  If the property is in close proximity to a beach fronting the Gulf of Mexico, the purchaser is hereby advised that the public has acquired a right of use or easement to or over the area of any public beach by prescription, dedication, or presumption, or has retained a right by virtue of continuous right in the public since time immemorial, as recognized in law and custom.
    
    The extreme seaward boundary of natural vegetation that spreads continuously inland customarily marks the landward boundary of the public easement.  If there is no clearly marked natural vegetation line, the landward boundary of the easement is as provided by Sections [61.016](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=61.016) and [61.017](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=61.017), Natural Resources Code.
    
    Much of the Gulf of Mexico coastline is eroding at rates of more than five feet per year.  Erosion rates for all Texas Gulf property subject to the open beaches act are available from the Texas General Land Office.
    
    State law prohibits any obstruction, barrier, restraint, or interference with the use of the public easement, including the placement of structures seaward of the landward boundary of the easement.  OWNERS OF STRUCTURES ERECTED SEAWARD OF THE VEGETATION LINE (OR OTHER APPLICABLE EASEMENT BOUNDARY) OR THAT BECOME SEAWARD OF THE VEGETATION LINE AS A RESULT OF PROCESSES SUCH AS SHORELINE EROSION ARE SUBJECT TO A LAWSUIT BY THE STATE OF TEXAS TO REMOVE THE STRUCTURES.
    
    The purchaser is hereby notified that the purchaser should:
    
    (1)  determine the rate of shoreline erosion in the vicinity of the real property; and
    
    (2)  seek the advice of an attorney or other qualified person before executing this contract or instrument of conveyance as to the relevance of these statutes and facts to the value of the property the purchaser is hereby purchasing or contracting to purchase.
    
    (b)  If the statement is not included in the executory contract for conveyance or there is no executory contract for conveyance, the statement must be delivered to, and receipt thereof acknowledged by, the purchaser not later than 10 calendar days prior to closing the transaction.
    
    (c)  Failure to comply with Subsection (a) or (b), as applicable, shall be grounds for the purchaser to terminate the contract or agreement to convey, and upon termination any earnest money shall be returned to the party making the deposit.
    
    (d)  A seller commits a deceptive act under Section [17.46](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=17.46), Business & Commerce Code, if the seller fails to comply with Subsection (a) or Subsection (b), as applicable.
    
    (e)  This section, or the failure of a person to give or receive the notice in the manner required by this section, does not diminish or modify the beach access and use rights of the public acquired through statute or under common law.

It is the public policy of this state that the state-owned beaches bordering on the seaward shore of the Gulf of Mexico, and any larger area extending from the line of mean low tide to the line of vegetation bordering on the Gulf of Mexico, if the public has acquired a right of use or easement to or over the area by the prescription or dedication or has retained a right by virtue of continuous right in the public, shall be used primarily for recreational purposes, and any use which substantially interferes with the enjoyment of the beach area by the public shall constitute an offense against the public policy of the state.  Nothing in this subchapter prevents any agency, department, political subdivision, or municipal corporation of this state from exercising its lawful authority under any law of this state to regulate safety conditions on any beach area subject to public use.
