    Sec. 11.013.  GULFWARD BOUNDARIES OF COUNTIES, CITIES, TOWNS, OR VILLAGES.  (a)  The gulfward boundary of each county located on the coastline of the Gulf of Mexico is the Three Marine League line as determined by the United States Supreme Court.
    
    (b)  The area in the extended boundaries of the counties as provided in this section becomes a part of the public free school land and is subject to the constitutional and statutory provisions of this state pertaining to the use, distribution, sale, and lease of public free school land in this state.
    
    (c)  The gulfward boundaries of any city, town, or village created and operating under the general laws of the State of Texas shall not be established or extended by incorporation or annexation more than 5,280 feet gulfward beyond the coastline.  The governing body of such a city, town, or village may, by ordinance, extend the municipal boundaries up to 5,280 feet gulfward.  Any inclusion of territory in any such city, town, or village more than 5,280 feet gulfward beyond the coastline is void.  The term "coastline" as used in this subsection means the line of mean low tide along that portion of the coast which is in direct contact with the open Gulf of Mexico.  The term "city, town, or village created and operating under the general laws of the State of Texas" shall not include any city operating under a home-rule charter.
    
    If any such general-law city, town, or village has heretofore been established by incorporation or attempted incorporation more than 5,280 feet gulfward beyond the coastline, the corporate existence of such general-law city, town, or village is in all things validated, ratified, approved, and confirmed.
    
    The boundaries of such general-law city, town, or village, including the gulfward boundaries to the extent of 5,280 feet gulfward beyond the coastline, are in all things validated, ratified, approved, and confirmed and shall not be held invalid by reason of the inclusion of more territory than is expressly authorized in Article 971, Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, 1925, as amended, or by reason of the inclusion of territory other than that which is intended to be used for strictly town or city purposes as required by Section [7.002](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=7.002), Local Government Code or by reason of not constituting a city, town, or village.
    
    Neither this Act nor the general laws nor the special laws of the state shall have the effect of validating, ratifying, approving, or confirming the inclusion of territory in any such general-law city, town, or village more than 5,280 feet gulfward beyond the coastline.
    
    If for any reason it should be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction that any such general-law city, town, or village has heretofore been incorporated in violation of the laws of the state in effect as of the date of such incorporation or is invalid, the corporate boundaries of any such general-law city, town, or village shall be revised and reformed to exclude all territory more than 5,280 feet gulfward of the coastline.

    (b)  The boundary of a home-rule city may not extend into the gulf outside of an area that is enclosed by:
    
    (1)  for home-rule cities which have not prior to May 1, 1983, annexed gulfward from the coastline:
    
    (A)  drawing a straight line connecting the two most remote points on the part of the coastline located in the city on June 1, 1983, the distance to be measured along the coastline;
    
    (B)  drawing straight lines that extend gulfward for one marine league from each of the two ends of the line drawn under Paragraph (A) of Subdivision (1) of this subsection and that are perpendicular to the line drawn under Paragraph (A);  and
    
    (C)  drawing a straight line connecting the two gulfward ends of the lines drawn under Paragraph (B) of Subdivision (1) of this subsection;  or
    
    (2)  for home-rule cities which have, prior to May 1, 1983, annexed no farther than one marine league gulfward from the coastline:

    (B)  drawing two straight lines that extend gulfward for one marine league, that are perpendicular to the line drawn under Paragraph (A) of Subdivision (2) of this subsection, and that each extend through one of the two most remote points from the coastline on the boundary lines extending gulfward from the coastline;
    
    (C)  drawing a straight line connecting the two gulfward ends of the lines drawn under Paragraph (B) of Subdivision (2) of this subsection;  or
    
    (3)  for home-rule cities which have, prior to May 1, 1983, annexed farther than one marine league gulfward from the coastline:
    
    (A)  drawing lines following the two current boundary lines extending gulfward from the coastline for a distance of one marine league;
    
    (B)  drawing a straight line connecting the two gulfward ends of the lines drawn under Paragraph (A) of Subdivision (3) of this subsection.
    
    (c)  A contract or agreement by which a home-rule city purports to pledge, directly or indirectly, taxes or other revenue from or attributable to state-owned submerged lands or other lands located outside the area described by Subsection (b) of this section does not create an enforceable right to prevent the reformation of the city's boundary under Subsection (d) of this section.
    
    (d)  The boundary of a home-rule city is void to the extent that it violates Subsection (b) of this section, and the boundary is reformed on the effective date of this Act to exclude the territory situated outside the area described by Subsection (b) of this section.
    
    (e)  A home-rule city may create industrial districts in the area that is outside the city limits and that is located in an area formed in the manner prescribed by Subsection (b) of this section except that the lines drawn under Paragraph (B) of Subdivision (1), Paragraph (B) of Subdivision (2) or Paragraph (A) of Subdivision (3) of Subsection (b) may be extended for no more than five statute miles instead of one marine league.  The governing body of such city shall have the right, power, and authority to designate the area described as an industrial district, as the term is customarily used, and to treat such area from time to time as such governing body may deem to be in the best interest of the city.  Included in such rights and powers of the governing body of any city is the right and power to enter into contracts or agreements with the owner(s) or lessee(s) of land in such industrial district upon such terms and considerations as the parties might deem appropriate.  The city shall have no authority to regulate oil and gas exploration, production, and transportation operations in an industrial district established pursuant to this Act, but in consideration of such relinquishment and the relinquishment of other rights under Section [42.044](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=42.044), Local Government Code, the city is expressly authorized to require payments of a property owner or lessee(s) in such industrial district in an amount not to exceed 35 percent of the revenue that would be produced if the city imposed a property tax in the industrial district.  Nothing herein shall prohibit a city and property owner or lessee(s) from agreement by contract for payments in a lesser amount.

    (b)  If the state or such permittee, lessee, or assignee and the private owner of the land through which an easement for access is sought cannot agree on the place or the terms for the easement to obtain access, either the state or such permittee, lessee, or assignee may, in order to provide that access, exercise this power of eminent domain in the manner provided by Chapter [21](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PR&Value=21), Property Code.
    
    (c)  Easements acquired under this section are declared to be for the sole use and benefit of the state, its permittee, lessee, or assignee and may be used only to the extent necessary to achieve the required access or for the purposes for which the permit, lease, or assignment was granted.

    (e)  If the easement acquired under this section is taken solely to benefit a tract of land in which the permanent school fund owns only a mineral interest, the easement shall not be permanent but shall be limited to the term that the state minerals are held under a valid prospect permit or lease.  The easement will terminate when the prospect permit and lease expires or terminates.
    
    (f)  This section is cumulative of the provisions of Subtitles C and D, Title 2, Natural Resources Code, relating to access to land and to the power of eminent domain.
