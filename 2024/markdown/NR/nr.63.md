    Sec. 63.001.  FINDINGS OF FACT.  The legislature finds and declares:
    
    (1)  that the mainland gulf shoreline, barrier islands, and peninsulas of this state contain a significant portion of the state's human, natural, and recreational resources;
    
    (2)  that these areas are and historically have been wholly or in part protected from the action of the water of the Gulf of Mexico and storms on the Gulf by a system of vegetated and unvegetated sand dunes that provide a protective barrier for adjacent land and inland water and land against the action of sand, wind, and water;
    
    (3)  that certain persons have from time to time modified or destroyed the effectiveness of the protective barriers and caused environmental damage in the process of developing the shoreline for various purposes;
    
    (4)  that the operation of recreational vehicles and other activities over these dunes have destroyed the natural vegetation on them;
    
    (5)  that these practices constitute serious threats to the safety of adjacent properties, to public highways, to the taxable basis of adjacent property and constitute a real danger to natural resources and to the health, safety, and welfare of persons living, visiting, or sojourning in the area;
    
    (6)  that it is necessary to protect these dunes as provided in this chapter because stabilized, vegetated dunes offer the best natural defense against storms and are areas of significant biological diversity;
    
    (7)  that vegetated stabilized dunes help preserve state-owned beaches and shores by protecting against erosion of the shoreline;  and
    
    (8)  that different areas of the coast are characterized by dunes of various types and values, all of which should be afforded protection.

    (c)  A person is considered to be engaging in or to have engaged in conduct that violates Section [63.091](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=NR&Value=63.091) or any rule, permit, or order issued under this chapter for purposes of this section if the person is the person who most recently owned, maintained, controlled, or possessed the real property on which the conduct occurred.

If a hearing is held, the commissioner may issue a final order approving the proposal for decision submitted by the administrative law judge concerning mitigation and payment of a penalty.  The commissioner may change a finding of fact or conclusion of law made by the administrative law judge, or may vacate or modify an order issued by the administrative law judge in accordance with Section [2001.058](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001.058), Government Code.

    (1)  request that the attorney general institute civil proceedings to collect the penalties, costs of restoration, and other fees and expenses remaining unpaid; or
    
    (2)  use any combination of the remedies prescribed by this section, or other remedies authorized by law, to collect the unpaid penalties, costs of restoration, and other fees and expenses assessed because of unauthorized conduct and its mitigation by the commissioner.
