    Sec. 87.052.  MAXIMUM PRODUCTION OF SOUR GAS FOR CARBON BLACK MANUFACTURE.  (a)  In any common reservoir in the state producing both sweet and sour gas, there shall never be produced from the common reservoir for use in carbon black manufacture a maximum daily volume of sour gas from the gas wells in excess of 750 million cubic feet.
    
    (b)  The commission shall prorate the daily volume of sour gas from gas wells among all the sour gas wells in the reservoir to prevent cognizable and preventable drainage of gas from tracts of land in the sour gas producing area segregated as to surface position and common ownership on which the sour gas wells are located.
    
    
    
    
    Acts 1977, 65th Leg., p. 2542, ch. 871, art. I, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1977.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 87.053.  EFFECT OF DEMAND BELOW MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE PRODUCTION.

    (1)  it is used in a plant producing an average recovery of not less than one and one-half pounds of carbon black for each 1,000 cubic feet of gas;  and
    
    (2)  the royalty rate and market price paid for the gas at the wellhead at least equals the royalty rate and market price paid at the wellhead in the immediate area for gas used for light and fuel purposes.
    
    (b)  In arriving at the market price of sour gas, a reduction of not more than one-half cent per 1,000 cubic feet shall be allowed for purifying the gas to render it suitable for light and fuel purposes.
    
    (c)  If the gas is used by a producer, any royalty rate paid shall be paid on the same basis.

    Sec. 87.171.  GAS CONTAINING LOW HYDROCARBON CONTENT.  Any natural gas, including casinghead gas, produced from any gas well or oil well in this state, containing less than one and one-half gallons of propane and heavier hydrocarbons per 1,000 cubic feet, as determined by fractional analysis made of the gas, may be used for the manufacture of carbon black in a plant producing an average recovery of at least one and one-half pounds of carbon black for each 1,000 cubic feet of gas consumed.
    
    
    
    
    Acts 1977, 65th Leg., p. 2545, ch. 871, art. I, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1977.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 87.172.  GAS CONTAINING HIGH HYDROCARBON CONTENT.  (a)  Except as provided in Subsection (b) of this section, no natural gas, including casinghead gas, produced from any gas well or oil well in this state, containing one and one-half gallons or more of propane and heavier hydrocarbons per 1,000 cubic feet, as determined by fractional analysis made of the gas, may be used for the manufacture of carbon black in a plant producing an average recovery of at least one and one-half pounds of carbon black for each 1,000 cubic feet of gas consumed without the prior extraction of its natural gasoline content.
    
    (b)  On the filing of an application and after proper notice and hearing as provided by law, the commission may authorize the use of any natural gas, including casinghead gas, containing one and one-half gallons or more of propane and heavier hydrocarbons per 1,000 cubic feet, as determined by fractional analysis made of the gas, in the manufacture of carbon black in a plant producing an average recovery of at least one and one-half pounds of carbon black for each 1,000 cubic feet of gas consumed if the commission finds it is unprofitable to first extract the natural gasoline content of the gas.
