    1. The name of the witness and his residence, if known, or that his residence is unknown;
    
    2. The diligence which has been used to procure his attendance;  and it shall not be considered sufficient diligence to have caused to be issued, or to have applied for, a subpoena, in cases where the law authorized an attachment to issue;  and

    3. That the testimony cannot be procured from any other source during the present term of the court.

    1. The name of the witness and his residence, if known, or that his residence is not known.
    
    2. The diligence which has been used to procure his attendance;  and it shall not be considered sufficient diligence to have caused to be issued, or to have applied for, a subpoena, in cases where the law authorized an attachment to issue.
    
    3. The facts which are expected to be proved by the witness, and it must appear to the court that they are material.
    
    4. That the witness is not absent by the procurement or consent of the defendant.
    
    5. That the motion is not made for delay.
    
    6. That there is no reasonable expectation that attendance of the witness can be secured during the present term of court by a postponement of the trial to some future day of said term.
