    Art. 42A.101.  PLACEMENT ON DEFERRED ADJUDICATION COMMUNITY SUPERVISION. (a)  Except as provided by Article [42A.102](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=42A.102)(b), if in the judge's opinion the best interest of society and the defendant will be served, the judge may, after receiving a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, hearing the evidence, and finding that it substantiates the defendant's guilt, defer further proceedings without entering an adjudication of guilt and place the defendant on deferred adjudication community supervision.
    
    (b)  After placing the defendant on deferred adjudication community supervision under Subsection (a), the judge shall inform the defendant orally or in writing of the possible consequences under Articles [42A.108](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=42A.108) and [42A.110](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=42A.110) of a violation of a condition of deferred adjudication community supervision.  If the information is provided orally, the judge must record and maintain the judge's statement to the defendant. The failure of a judge to inform a defendant of possible consequences under Articles [42A.108](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=42A.108) and [42A.110](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=42A.110) is not a ground for reversal unless the defendant shows that the defendant was harmed by the failure of the judge to provide the information.

    (1)  not less than 90 days or more than one year, if the defendant is convicted under Sections 49.04-49.08, Penal Code;

    (1)  suspend the defendant's driver's license; or
    
    (2)  issue an order prohibiting the defendant from obtaining a license for a period of one year.

    Art. 42A.408.  USE OF IGNITION INTERLOCK DEVICE.  (a)  In this article, "ignition interlock device" means a device that uses a deep-lung breath analysis mechanism to make impractical the operation of the motor vehicle if ethyl alcohol is detected in the breath of the operator.
    
    (b)  The court may require as a condition of community supervision that a defendant placed on community supervision after conviction of an offense under Sections 49.04-49.08, Penal Code, have an ignition interlock device installed on the motor vehicle owned by the defendant or on the vehicle most regularly driven by the defendant and that the defendant not operate any motor vehicle that is not equipped with that device.
    
    (c)  The court shall require as a condition of community supervision that a defendant described by Subsection (b) have an ignition interlock device installed on the motor vehicle owned by the defendant or on the vehicle most regularly driven by the defendant and that the defendant not operate any motor vehicle unless the vehicle is equipped with that device if:
    
    (1)  it is shown on the trial of the offense that an analysis of a specimen of the defendant's blood, breath, or urine showed an alcohol concentration level of 0.15 or more at the time the analysis was performed;
    
    (2)  the defendant is placed on community supervision after conviction of an offense under Sections 49.04-49.061, Penal Code, for which the defendant is punished under Section [49.09](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=49.09)(a) or (b), Penal Code; or
    
    (3)  the court determines under Subsection (d) that the defendant has one or more previous convictions under Sections 49.04-49.08, Penal Code.
    
    (d)  Before placing on community supervision a defendant convicted of an offense under Sections 49.04-49.08, Penal Code, the court shall determine from criminal history record information maintained by the Department of Public Safety whether the defendant has one or more previous convictions under any of those sections. A previous conviction may not be used for purposes of restricting a defendant to the operation of a motor vehicle equipped with an ignition interlock device under Subsection (c) if:
    
    (1)  the previous conviction was a final conviction under Section [49.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=49.04), [49.045](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=49.045), [49.05](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=49.05), [49.06](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=49.06), [49.061](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=49.061), [49.07](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=49.07), or [49.08](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=49.08), Penal Code, and was for an offense committed before the beginning of the 10-year period preceding the date of the instant offense for which the defendant was convicted and placed on community supervision; and
    
    (2)  the defendant has not been convicted of an offense under Section [49.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=49.04), [49.045](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=49.045), [49.05](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=49.05), [49.06](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=49.06), [49.061](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=49.061), [49.07](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=49.07), or [49.08](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=49.08), Penal Code, committed within the 10-year period preceding the date of the instant offense for which the defendant was convicted and placed on community supervision.
    
    (e)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter or other law, a judge who places on community supervision a defendant who was younger than 21 years of age at the time of the offense and was convicted for an offense under Sections 49.04-49.08, Penal Code, shall require as a condition of community supervision that the defendant not operate any motor vehicle unless the vehicle is equipped with an ignition interlock device.
    
    (e-1)  Except as provided by Subsection (e-2), a judge granting deferred adjudication community supervision to a defendant for an offense under Section [49.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=49.04) or [49.06](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=49.06), Penal Code, shall require that the defendant as a condition of community supervision have an ignition interlock device installed on the motor vehicle owned by the defendant or on the vehicle most regularly driven by the defendant and that the defendant not operate any motor vehicle that is not equipped with that device.  If the judge determines that the defendant is unable to pay for the ignition interlock device, the judge may impose a reasonable payment schedule, as provided by Subsection (f).  If the defendant provides the court evidence under Section [709.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=709.001), Transportation Code, sufficient to establish that the defendant is indigent for purposes of that section, the judge may enter in the record a finding that the defendant is indigent and reduce the costs to the defendant by ordering a waiver of the installation charge for the ignition interlock device and a 50 percent reduction of the monthly device monitoring fee.  A reduction in costs ordered under this subsection does not apply to any fees that may be assessed against the defendant if the ignition interlock device detects ethyl alcohol on the breath of the person attempting to operate the motor vehicle.
    
    (e-2)  A judge may waive the ignition interlock requirement under Subsection (e-1) for a defendant if, based on a controlled substance and alcohol evaluation of the defendant, the judge determines and enters in the record that restricting the defendant to the use of an ignition interlock is not necessary for the safety of the community. 
    
    (f)  The court shall require the defendant to obtain an ignition interlock device at the defendant's own cost before the 30th day after the date of conviction unless the court finds that to do so would not be in the best interest of justice and enters its findings on record.  The court shall require the defendant to provide evidence to the court within the 30-day period that the device has been installed on the appropriate vehicle and order the device to remain installed on that vehicle for a period the length of which is not less than 50 percent of the supervision period.  If the court determines the defendant is unable to pay for the ignition interlock device, the court may impose a reasonable payment schedule not to exceed twice the length of the period of the court's order.
    
    (g)  The Department of Public Safety shall approve ignition interlock devices for use under this article.  Section [521.247](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=521.247), Transportation Code, applies to the approval of a device under this article and the consequences of that approval.
    
    (h)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, if a defendant is required to operate a motor vehicle in the course and scope of the defendant's employment and if the vehicle is owned by the employer, the defendant may operate that vehicle without installation of an approved ignition interlock device if the employer has been notified of that driving privilege restriction and if proof of that notification is with the vehicle.  The employment exemption does not apply if the business entity that owns the vehicle is owned or controlled by the defendant.

    (2)  premises at which the defendant is participating in a program or activity required as a condition of community supervision;

    (b)  At any time during the period of community supervision, the judge may issue a warrant for a violation of any condition of community supervision and cause the defendant to be arrested.  Any supervision officer, police officer, or other officer with the power of arrest may arrest the defendant with or without a warrant on the order of the judge to be noted on the docket of the court.  Subject to Subsection (c), a defendant arrested under this subsection may be detained in the county jail or other appropriate place of confinement until the defendant can be taken before the judge for a determination regarding the alleged violation.  The arresting officer shall immediately report the arrest and detention to the judge.
    
    (c)  Without any unnecessary delay, but not later than 48 hours after the defendant is arrested, the arresting officer or the person with custody of the defendant shall take the defendant before the judge who ordered the arrest for the alleged violation of a condition of community supervision or, if the judge is unavailable, before a magistrate of the county in which the defendant was arrested.  The judge or magistrate shall perform all appropriate duties and may exercise all appropriate powers as provided by Article [15.17](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=15.17) with respect to an arrest for a new offense, except that only the judge who ordered the arrest for the alleged violation may authorize the defendant's release on bail.

    (2)  affirms that the defendant has nothing to say as to why sentence should not be pronounced against the defendant; and
    
    (3)  requests the judge to revoke community supervision and to pronounce sentence.
    
    (f)  In a felony case, the state may amend the motion to revoke community supervision at any time before the seventh day before the date of the revocation hearing, after which time the motion may not be amended except for good cause shown.  The state may not amend the motion after the commencement of taking evidence at the revocation hearing.
    
    (g)  The judge may continue the revocation hearing for good cause shown by either the defendant or the state.
    
    (h)  The court may not revoke the community supervision of a defendant if, at the revocation hearing, the court finds that the only evidence supporting the alleged violation of a condition of community supervision is the uncorroborated results of a polygraph examination.
    
    (i)  In a revocation hearing at which it is alleged only that the defendant violated the conditions of community supervision by failing to pay community supervision fees or court costs or by failing to pay the costs of legal services as described by Article [42A.301](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=42A.301)(b)(11), the state must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant was able to pay and did not pay as ordered by the judge.
    
    (j)  The court may order a community supervision and corrections department to obtain information pertaining to the factors listed under Article [42.037](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=42.037)(h) and include that information in the presentence report required under Article [42A.252](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=42A.252)(a) or a separate report, as the court directs.

    (l)  A court retains jurisdiction to hold a hearing under Subsection (d) and to revoke, continue, or modify community supervision, regardless of whether the period of community supervision imposed on the defendant has expired, if before the expiration of the supervision period:
    
    (1)  the attorney representing the state files a motion to revoke, continue, or modify community supervision; and
