    (2)  the applicant is alleged, by any means including the issuance of a warrant for the applicant's arrest or the applicant's arrest pursuant to Chapter [14](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=14), to have committed a criminal offense that provides the basis for the restraint from which the application seeks relief; or

    Art. 11.07. PROCEDURE AFTER CONVICTION WITHOUT DEATH PENALTY
    
    Sec. 1. This article establishes the procedures for an application for writ of habeas corpus in which the applicant seeks relief from a felony judgment imposing a penalty other than death.
    
    Sec. 2.  Repealed by Acts 2023, 88th Leg., R.S., Ch. 933 (S.B. [1516](http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/88R/billtext/html/SB01516F.HTM)), Sec. 20, eff. September 1, 2023.
    
    Sec. 3.  (a)  After final conviction in any felony case, the writ must be made returnable to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas at Austin, Texas.
    
    (b)  An application for writ of habeas corpus filed after final conviction in a felony case, other than a case in which the death penalty is imposed, must be filed with the clerk of the court in which the conviction being challenged was obtained, and the clerk shall assign the application to that court.  When the application is received by that court, a writ of habeas corpus, returnable to the Court of Criminal Appeals, shall issue by operation of law.  The clerk of that court shall make appropriate notation thereof, assign to the case a file number (ancillary to that of the conviction being challenged), and forward a copy of the application by certified mail, return receipt requested, by electronic mail, or by personal service to the attorney representing the state in that court, who shall answer the application not later than the 30th day after the date the copy of the application is received.  Matters alleged in the application not admitted by the state are deemed denied.
    
    (c) Within 20 days of the expiration of the time in which the state is allowed to answer, it shall be the duty of the convicting court to decide whether there are controverted, previously unresolved facts material to the legality of the applicant's confinement.  Confinement means confinement for any offense or any collateral consequence resulting from the conviction that is the basis of the instant habeas corpus.  If the convicting court decides that there are no such issues, the clerk shall immediately transmit to the Court of Criminal Appeals a copy of the application , any answers filed, and a certificate reciting the date upon which that finding was made.  Failure of the court to act within the allowed 20 days shall constitute such a finding.
    
    (d)  If the convicting court decides that there are controverted, previously unresolved facts which are material to the legality of the applicant's confinement, it shall enter an order within 20 days of the expiration of the time allowed for the state to reply, designating the issues of fact to be resolved.  To resolve those issues the court may order affidavits, depositions, interrogatories, additional forensic testing, and hearings, as well as using personal recollection. The state shall pay the cost of additional forensic testing ordered under this subsection, except that the applicant shall pay the cost of the testing if the applicant retains counsel for purposes of filing an application under this article.  The convicting court may appoint an attorney or a magistrate to hold a hearing and make findings of fact.  An attorney so appointed shall be compensated as provided in Article [26.05](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=26.05) of this code.  It shall be the duty of the reporter who is designated to transcribe a hearing held pursuant to this article to prepare a transcript within 15 days of its conclusion.  On completion of the transcript, the reporter shall immediately transmit the transcript to the clerk of the convicting court.  After the convicting court makes findings of fact or approves the findings of the person designated to make them, the clerk of the convicting court shall immediately transmit to the Court of Criminal Appeals, under one cover, the application, any answers filed, any motions filed, transcripts of all depositions and hearings, any affidavits, and any other matters such as official records used by the court in resolving issues of fact.
    
    (e)  For the purposes of Subsection (d), "additional forensic testing" does not include forensic DNA testing as provided for in Chapter [64](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=64).
    
    Sec. 4.  (a)  If a subsequent application for writ of habeas corpus is filed after final disposition of an initial application challenging the same conviction, a court may not consider the merits of or grant relief based on the subsequent application unless the application contains sufficient specific facts establishing that:
    
    (1) the current claims and issues have not been and could not have been presented previously in an original application or in a previously considered application filed under this article because the factual or legal basis for the claim was unavailable on the date the applicant filed the previous application;  or
    
    (2) by a preponderance of the evidence, but for a violation of the United States Constitution no rational juror could have found the applicant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
    
    (b) For purposes of Subsection (a)(1), a legal basis of a claim is unavailable on or before a date described by Subsection (a)(1) if the legal basis was not recognized by and could not have been reasonably formulated from a final decision of the United States Supreme Court, a court of appeals of the United States, or a court of appellate jurisdiction of this state on or before that date.
    
    (c) For purposes of Subsection (a)(1), a factual basis of a claim is unavailable on or before a date described by Subsection (a)(1) if the factual basis was not ascertainable through the exercise of reasonable diligence on or before that date.
    
    Sec. 5. The Court of Criminal Appeals may deny relief upon the findings and conclusions of the hearing judge without docketing the cause, or may direct that the cause be docketed and heard as though originally presented to said court or as an appeal.  Upon reviewing the record the court shall enter its judgment remanding the applicant to custody or ordering his release, as the law and facts may justify.  The mandate of the court shall issue to the court issuing the writ, as in other criminal cases.  After conviction the procedure outlined in this Act shall be exclusive and any other proceeding shall be void and of no force and effect in discharging the prisoner.
    
    Sec. 6. Upon any hearing by a district judge by virtue of this Act, the attorney for applicant, and the state, shall be given at least seven full days' notice before such hearing is held.
    
    Sec. 7. When the attorney for the state files an answer, motion, or other pleading relating to an application for a writ of habeas corpus or the court issues an order relating to an application for a writ of habeas corpus, the clerk of the court shall mail or deliver to the applicant a copy of the answer, motion, pleading, or order.

    Sec. 2. REPRESENTATION BY COUNSEL.    (a)  An applicant shall be represented by competent counsel unless the applicant has elected to proceed pro se and the convicting trial court finds, after a hearing on the record, that the applicant's election is intelligent and voluntary.
    
    (b)  If a defendant is sentenced to death the convicting court, immediately after judgment is entered under Article [42.01](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=42.01), shall determine if the defendant is indigent and, if so, whether the defendant desires appointment of counsel for the purpose of a writ of habeas corpus.  If the defendant desires appointment of counsel for the purpose of a writ of habeas corpus, the court shall appoint the office of capital and forensic writs to represent the defendant as provided by Subsection (c).
    
    (c)  At the earliest practical time, but in no event later than 30 days, after the convicting court makes the findings required under Subsections (a) and (b), the convicting court shall appoint the office of capital and forensic writs or, if the office of capital and forensic writs does not accept or is prohibited from accepting an appointment under Section [78.054](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=78.054), Government Code, other competent counsel under Subsection (f), unless the applicant elects to proceed pro se or is represented by retained counsel.  On appointing counsel under this section, the convicting court shall immediately notify the court of criminal appeals of the appointment, including in the notice a copy of the judgment and the name, address, and telephone number of the appointed counsel.
    
    (d)  Repealed by Acts 2009, 81st Leg., R.S., Ch. 781, Sec. 11, eff. January 1, 2010.

Section 3599.  The attorney shall immediately file a copy of the motion with the court of criminal appeals, and if the attorney fails to do so, the court may take any action to ensure that the applicant's right to federal habeas review is protected, including initiating contempt proceedings against the attorney.
    
    (f)  If the office of capital and forensic writs does not accept or is prohibited from accepting an appointment under Section [78.054](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=78.054), Government Code, the convicting court shall appoint counsel from a list of competent counsel maintained by the presiding judges of the administrative judicial regions under Section [78.056](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=78.056), Government Code.

(a)  The state shall reimburse a county for compensation of counsel under Section 2, other than for compensation of counsel employed by the office of capital and forensic writs, and for payment of expenses under Section 3, regardless of whether counsel is employed by the office of capital and forensic writs.  The total amount of reimbursement to which a county is entitled under this section for an application under this article may not exceed $25,000.  Compensation and expenses in excess of the $25,000 reimbursement provided by the state are the obligation of the county.
    
    (b) A convicting court seeking reimbursement for a county shall certify to the comptroller of public accounts the amount of compensation that the county is entitled to receive under this section.  The comptroller of public accounts shall issue a warrant to the county in the amount certified by the convicting court, not to exceed $25,000.
    
    (c) The limitation imposed by this section on the reimbursement by the state to a county for compensation of counsel and payment of reasonable expenses does not prohibit a county from compensating counsel and reimbursing expenses in an amount that is in excess of the amount the county receives from the state as reimbursement, and a county is specifically granted discretion by this subsection to make payments in excess of the state reimbursement.
    
    (d) The comptroller shall reimburse a county for the compensation and payment of expenses of an attorney appointed by the court of criminal appeals under prior law.  A convicting court seeking reimbursement for a county as permitted by this subsection shall certify the amount the county is entitled to receive under this subsection for an application filed under this article, not to exceed a total amount of $25,000.
    
    Sec. 3. INVESTIGATION OF GROUNDS FOR APPLICATION.    (a)  On appointment, counsel shall investigate expeditiously, before and after the appellate record is filed in the court of criminal appeals, the factual and legal grounds for the filing of an application for a writ of habeas corpus.
    
    (b) Not later than the 30th day before the date the application for a writ of habeas corpus is filed with the convicting court, counsel may file with the convicting court an ex parte, verified, and confidential request for prepayment of expenses, including expert fees, to investigate and present potential habeas corpus claims.  The request for expenses must state:
    
    (1) the claims of the application to be investigated;
    
    (2) specific facts that suggest that a claim of possible merit may exist;  and
    
    (3) an itemized list of anticipated expenses for each claim.
    
    (c) The court shall grant a request for expenses in whole or in part if the request for expenses is timely and reasonable.  If the court denies in whole or in part the request for expenses, the court shall briefly state the reasons for the denial in a written order provided to the applicant.
    
    (d) Counsel may incur expenses for habeas corpus investigation, including expenses for experts, without prior approval by the convicting court or the court of criminal appeals.  On presentation of a claim for reimbursement, which may be presented ex parte, the convicting court shall order reimbursement of counsel for expenses, if the expenses are reasonably necessary and reasonably incurred.  If the convicting court denies in whole or in part the request for expenses, the court shall briefly state the reasons for the denial in a written order provided to the applicant.  The applicant may request reconsideration of the denial for reimbursement by the convicting court.
    
    (e) Materials submitted to the court under this section are a part of the court's record.
    
    (f)  This section applies to counsel's investigation of the factual and legal grounds for the filing of an application for a writ of habeas corpus, regardless of whether counsel is employed by the office of capital and forensic writs.
    
    Sec. 4. FILING OF APPLICATION.    (a)  An application for a writ of habeas corpus, returnable to the court of criminal appeals, must be filed in the convicting court not later than the 180th day after the date the convicting court appoints counsel under Section 2 or not later than the 45th day after the date the state's original brief is filed on direct appeal with the court of criminal appeals, whichever date is later.
    
    (b) The convicting court, before the filing date that is applicable to the applicant under Subsection (a), may for good cause shown and after notice and an opportunity to be heard by the attorney representing the state grant one 90-day extension that begins on the filing date applicable to the defendant under Subsection (a).  Either party may request that the court hold a hearing on the request.  If the convicting court finds that the applicant cannot establish good cause justifying the requested extension, the court shall make a finding stating that fact and deny the request for the extension.
    
    (c) An application filed after the filing date that is applicable to the applicant under Subsection (a) or (b) is untimely.
    
    (d) If the convicting court receives an untimely application or determines that after the filing date that is applicable to the applicant under Subsection (a) or (b) no application has been filed, the convicting court immediately, but in any event within 10 days, shall send to the court of criminal appeals and to the attorney representing the state:
    
    (1) a copy of the untimely application, with a statement of the convicting court that the application is untimely, or a statement of the convicting court that no application has been filed within the time periods required by Subsections (a) and (b);  and
    
    (2) any order the judge of the convicting court determines should be attached to an untimely application or statement under Subdivision (1).
    
    (e) A failure to file an application before the filing date applicable to the applicant under Subsection (a) or (b) constitutes a waiver of all grounds for relief that were available to the applicant before the last date on which an application could be timely filed, except as provided by Section 4A.
    
    Sec. 4A. UNTIMELY APPLICATION;  APPLICATION NOT FILED.    (a)  On command of the court of criminal appeals, a counsel who files an untimely application or fails to file an application before the filing date applicable under Section 4(a) or (b) shall show cause as to why the application was untimely filed or not filed before the filing date.
    
    (b) At the conclusion of the counsel's presentation to the court of criminal appeals, the court may:
    
    (1) find that good cause has not been shown and dismiss the application;
    
    (2) permit the counsel to continue representation of the applicant and establish a new filing date for the application, which may be not more than 180 days from the date the court permits the counsel to continue representation;  or
    
    (3) appoint new counsel to represent the applicant and establish a new filing date for the application, which may be not more than 270 days after the date the court appoints new counsel.
    
    (c) The court of criminal appeals may hold in contempt counsel who files an untimely application or fails to file an application before the date required by Section 4(a) or (b).  The court of criminal appeals may punish as a separate instance of contempt each day after the first day on which the counsel fails to timely file the application.  In addition to or in lieu of holding counsel in contempt, the court of criminal appeals may enter an order denying counsel compensation under Section 2A.
    
    (d) If the court of criminal appeals establishes a new filing date for the application, the court of criminal appeals shall notify the convicting court of that fact and the convicting court shall proceed under this article.
    
    (e)  Sections 2A and 3 apply to compensation and reimbursement of counsel appointed under Subsection (b)(3) in the same manner as if counsel had been appointed by the convicting court, unless the attorney is employed by the office of capital and forensic writs, in which case the compensation of that attorney is governed by Subchapter [B](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=78.051), Chapter [78](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=78), Government Code.
    
    (f)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, the court of criminal appeals shall appoint counsel and establish a new filing date for application, which may be no later than the 270th day after the date on which counsel is appointed, for each applicant who before September 1, 1999, filed an untimely application or failed to file an application before the date required by Section 4(a) or (b).  Section 2A applies to the compensation and payment of expenses of counsel appointed by the court of criminal appeals under this subsection, unless the attorney is employed by the office of capital and forensic writs, in which case the compensation of that attorney is governed by Subchapter [B](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=78.051), Chapter [78](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=78), Government Code.
    
    Sec. 5. SUBSEQUENT APPLICATION.    (a)  If a subsequent application for a writ of habeas corpus is filed after filing an initial application, a court may not consider the merits of or grant relief based on the subsequent application unless the application contains sufficient specific facts establishing that:

    (2)  by a preponderance of the evidence, but for a violation of the United States Constitution no rational juror could have found the applicant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt; or

    (b-1)  If the convicting court receives notice that the requirements of Section 5(a) for consideration of a subsequent application have been met and if the applicant has not elected to proceed pro se and is not represented by retained counsel, the convicting court shall appoint, in order of priority:
    
    (1)  the attorney who represented the applicant in the proceedings under Section 5, if the attorney seeks the appointment;
    
    (2)  the office of capital and forensic writs, if the office represented the applicant in the proceedings under Section 5 or otherwise accepts the appointment; or

    (b) At the time the application is filed, the applicant must be, or have been, on community supervision, and the application must challenge the legal validity of:
    
    (1) the conviction for which or order in which community supervision was imposed;  or
    
    (2) the conditions of community supervision.
    
    Sec. 3.  (a)  An application may not be filed under this article if the applicant could obtain the requested relief by means of an appeal under Article [44.02](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=44.02) and Rule 25.2, Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure.
    
    (b) An applicant seeking to challenge a particular condition of community supervision but not the legality of the conviction for which or the order in which community supervision was imposed must first attempt to gain relief by filing a motion to amend the conditions of community supervision.
    
    (c) An applicant may challenge a condition of community supervision under this article only on constitutional grounds.
    
    Sec. 4.  (a)  When an application is filed under this article, a writ of habeas corpus issues by operation of law.
    
    (b) At the time the application is filed, the clerk of the court shall assign the case a file number ancillary to that of the judgment of conviction or order being challenged.
    
    Sec. 5.  (a)  Immediately on filing an application, the applicant shall serve a copy of the application on the attorney representing the state by:
    
    (1)  certified mail, return receipt requested;
    
    (2)  personal service;
    
    (3)  electronic service through the electronic filing manager authorized by Rule 21, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure; or
    
    (4)  a secure electronic transmission to the attorney's e-mail address filed with the electronic filing system as required under Section [80.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=80.003), Government Code.
    
    (b) The state may file an answer within the period established by Subsection (c), but is not required to file an answer.
    
    (c) The state may not file an answer after the 30th day after the date of service, except that for good cause the convicting court may grant the state one 30-day extension.
    
    (d) Any answer, motion, or other document filed by the state must be served on the applicant by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by personal service.
    
    (e) Matters alleged in the application not admitted by the state are considered to have been denied.
    
    Sec. 6.  (a)  Not later than the 60th day after the day on which the state's answer is filed, the trial court shall enter a written order granting or denying the relief sought in the application.
    
    (b) In making its determination, the court may order affidavits, depositions, interrogatories, or a hearing, and may rely on the court's personal recollection.
    
    (c) If a hearing is ordered, the hearing may not be held before the eighth day after the day on which the applicant and the state are provided notice of the hearing.
    
    (d) The court may appoint an attorney or magistrate to hold a hearing ordered under this section and make findings of fact.

    Sec. 7.  (a)  If the court determines from the face of an application or documents attached to the application that the applicant is manifestly entitled to no relief, the court shall enter a written order denying the application as frivolous.  In any other case, the court shall enter a written order including findings of fact and conclusions of law.  The court may require the prevailing party to submit a proposed order.
    
    (b)  At the time an order is entered under this section, the clerk of the court shall immediately, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by secure electronic mail, send a copy of the order to the applicant and to the state.
    
    Sec. 8. If the application is denied in whole or part, the applicant may appeal under Article [44.02](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=44.02) and Rule 31, Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure.

    Sec. 9.  (a)  If a subsequent application for a writ of habeas corpus is filed after final disposition of an initial application under this article, a court may not consider the merits of or grant relief based on the subsequent application unless the application contains sufficient specific facts establishing that the current claims and issues have not been and could not have been presented previously in an original application or in a previously considered application filed under this article because the factual or legal basis for the claim was unavailable on the date the applicant filed the previous application.
    
    (b) For purposes of Subsection (a), a legal basis of a claim is unavailable on or before a date described by that subsection if the legal basis was not recognized by and could not have been reasonably formulated from a final decision of the United States Supreme Court, a court of appeals of the United States, or a court of appellate jurisdiction of this state on or before that date.
    
    (c) For purposes of Subsection (a), a factual basis of a claim is unavailable on or before a date described by that subsection if the factual basis was not ascertainable through the exercise of reasonable diligence on or before that date.
