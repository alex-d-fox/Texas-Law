    (c) The county treasurer shall pay a juror the amount due the juror for expenses under this article after receiving a certificate from a clerk of a court or justice of the peace stating the amount due the juror.

    (f) At each regular meeting of the commissioners court of a county, the court shall determine whether, since the last regular meeting of the court, a defendant described by Subsection (e) has been tried in the county.

The account must show the number of days the jury was impaneled in the case and the jury pay and expenses incurred by the county in the case.
    
    (g) The county judge of the county in which the defendant was tried shall certify the correctness of the account and send the account to the county judge of the county in which the defendant was indicted.  The county in which the defendant was indicted shall pay the account in the same manner required for payment of the expenses of transferred prisoners under Article [104.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=104.002).

If a prisoner is transferred to a county from another county on a change of venue, for safekeeping, or for a habeas corpus hearing, the county transferring the prisoner is liable for the expenses described by this article.
    
    (b) If a county incurs expenses for the safekeeping of a prisoner from another county, the sheriff shall submit to the county judge an account of expenses incurred by the county for the prisoner.  The county judge shall approve the amount he determines is a correct statement of the expenses and sign and date the account.
    
    (c) The county judge shall submit to the commissioners court of the county for which the prisoner was kept, at a regular term of the court, his signed statement of the account described by Subsection (b).

    (d)  A person who is or was a prisoner in a county jail and received medical, dental, or health related services from a county or a hospital district shall be required to pay a reimbursement fee for such services when they are rendered.
