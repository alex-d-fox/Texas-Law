    1. That it appears by the records of the court that the indictment was not found by at least nine grand jurors, or that the information was not based upon a valid complaint;
    
    2. That some person not authorized by law was present when the grand jury was deliberating upon the accusation against the defendant, or was voting upon the same;  and
    
    3. That the grand jury was illegally impaneled;  provided, however, in order to raise such question on motion to set aside the indictment, the defendant must show that he did not have an opportunity to challenge the array at the time the grand jury was impaneled.

    (2) resulted in conviction;
    
    (3) was improperly terminated;  or
    
    (4) was terminated by a final order or judgment for the defendant that has not been reversed, set aside, or vacated and that necessarily required a determination inconsistent with a fact that must be established to secure conviction in the subsequent prosecution.

    1. That it does not appear therefrom that an offense against the law was committed by the defendant;
    
    2. That it appears from the face thereof that a prosecution for the offense is barred by a lapse of time, or that the offense was committed after the finding of the indictment;

    Art. 27.14. PLEA OF GUILTY OR NOLO CONTENDERE IN MISDEMEANOR.  (a)  A plea of "guilty" or a plea of "nolo contendere" in a misdemeanor case may be made either by the defendant or his counsel in open court;  in such case, the defendant or his counsel may waive a jury, and the punishment may be assessed by the court either upon or without evidence, at the discretion of the court.
    
    (b)  A defendant charged with a misdemeanor for which the maximum possible punishment is by fine only may, in lieu of the method provided in Subsection (a), mail or deliver in person to the court a plea of "guilty" or a plea of "nolo contendere" and a waiver of jury trial. The defendant may also request in writing that the court notify the defendant, at the address stated in the request, of the amount of an appeal bond that the court will approve. If the court receives a plea and waiver before the time the defendant is scheduled to appear in court, the court shall dispose of the case without requiring a court appearance by the defendant. If the court receives a plea and waiver after the time the defendant is scheduled to appear in court but at least five business days before a scheduled trial date, the court shall dispose of the case without requiring a court appearance by the defendant. The court shall notify the defendant either in person or by regular mail of the amount of any fine or costs assessed in the case, information regarding the alternatives to the full payment of any fine or costs assessed against the defendant, if the defendant is unable to pay that amount, and, if requested by the defendant, the amount of an appeal bond that the court will approve. Except as otherwise provided by this code, the defendant shall pay any fine or costs assessed or give an appeal bond in the amount stated in the notice before the 31st day after receiving the notice. This subsection does not apply to a defendant charged with a misdemeanor involving family violence, as defined by Section [71.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=71.004), Family Code.
    
    (c) In a misdemeanor case for which the maximum possible punishment is by fine only, payment of a fine or an amount accepted by the court constitutes a finding of guilty in open court as though a plea of nolo contendere had been entered by the defendant and constitutes a waiver of a jury trial in writing.
    
      
    
    
    Text of subsection effective until January 01, 2025
    
      
    
    
    (d)  If written notice of an offense for which maximum possible punishment is by fine only or of a violation relating to the manner, time, and place of parking has been prepared, delivered, and filed with the court and a legible duplicate copy has been given to the defendant, the written notice serves as a complaint to which the defendant may plead "guilty," "not guilty," or "nolo contendere."  If the defendant pleads "not guilty" to the offense or fails to appear based on the written notice, a complaint shall be filed that conforms to the requirements of Chapter [45](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=45) of this code, and that complaint serves as an original complaint.  A defendant may waive the filing of a sworn complaint and elect that the prosecution proceed on the written notice of the charged offense if the defendant agrees in writing with the prosecution, signs the agreement, and files it with the court.
    
      
    
    
    Text of subsection effective on January 01, 2025
    
      
    
    
    (d)  If written notice of an offense for which maximum possible punishment is by fine only or of a violation relating to the manner, time, and place of parking has been prepared, delivered, and filed with the court and a legible duplicate copy has been given to the defendant, the written notice serves as a complaint to which the defendant may plead "guilty," "not guilty," or "nolo contendere."  If the defendant pleads "not guilty" to the offense or fails to appear based on the written notice, a complaint shall be filed that conforms to the requirements of Chapter [45A](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=45A), and that complaint serves as an original complaint.  A defendant may waive the filing of a sworn complaint and elect that the prosecution proceed on the written notice of the charged offense if the defendant agrees in writing with the prosecution, signs the agreement, and files it with the court.
    
    (e)(1)  Before accepting a plea of guilty or a plea of nolo contendere by a defendant charged with a misdemeanor involving family violence, as defined by Section [71.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=71.004), Family Code, the court shall admonish the defendant by using the following statement:
    
    "If you are convicted of a misdemeanor offense involving violence where you are or were a spouse, intimate partner, parent, or guardian of the victim or are or were involved in another, similar relationship with the victim, it may be unlawful for you to possess or purchase a firearm, including a handgun or long gun, or ammunition, pursuant to federal law under 18 U.S.C. Section 922(g)(9) or Section [46.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=46.04)(b), Texas Penal Code.  If you have any questions whether these laws make it illegal for you to possess or purchase a firearm, you should consult an attorney."
    
    (2)  The court may provide the admonishment under Subdivision (1) orally or in writing.

    Art. 27.18.  PLEA OR WAIVER OF RIGHTS BY VIDEOCONFERENCE.  (a)  Notwithstanding any provision of this code requiring that a plea or a waiver of a defendant's right be made in open court, a court may accept the plea or waiver by videoconference to the court if:
    
    (1)  the defendant and the attorney representing the state file with the court written consent to the use of videoconference;
    
    (2)  the videoconference provides for a simultaneous, compressed full motion video, and interactive communication of image and sound between the judge, the attorney representing the state, the defendant, and the defendant's attorney; and
    
    (3)  on request of the defendant, the defendant and the defendant's attorney are able to communicate privately without being recorded or heard by the judge or the attorney representing the state.
    
    (b)  On motion of the defendant or the attorney representing the state or in the court's discretion, the court may terminate an appearance by videoconference at any time during the appearance and require an appearance by the defendant in open court.

    (c-2)  The loss or destruction of or failure to create a court record or an electronic recording of a plea entered under this article is not alone sufficient grounds for a defendant to withdraw the defendant's plea or to request the court to set aside a conviction, sentence, or plea.
    
    (d)  A defendant who is confined in a county other than the county in which charges against the defendant are pending may use the videoconference method provided by this article or by Article [15.17](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=15.17) to enter a plea or waive a right in the court with jurisdiction over the case.
    
    (e)  A defendant who enters a plea or waiver under Subsection (d):
    
    (1)  consents to venue in the county in which the court receiving the plea or waiver is located; and
    
    (2)  waives any claim of error related to venue.
    
    (f)  Subsection (e) does not prohibit a court from granting a defendant's motion for a change of venue during the trial of the defendant.
    
    (g)  If a defendant enters a plea of guilty or nolo contendere under Subsection (d), the attorney representing the state may request at the time the plea is entered that the defendant submit a fingerprint of the defendant suitable for attachment to the judgment.  On request for a fingerprint under this subsection, the county in which the defendant is confined shall obtain a fingerprint of the defendant and use first-class mail or other means acceptable to the attorney representing the state and the county to forward the fingerprint to the court accepting the plea.
