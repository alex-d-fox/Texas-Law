    1. The indictment or information shall be read to the jury by the attorney prosecuting.  When prior convictions are alleged for purposes of enhancement only and are not jurisdictional, that portion of the indictment or information reciting such convictions shall not be read until the hearing on punishment is held as provided in Article [37.07](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=37.07).

    3. The State's attorney shall state to the jury the nature of the accusation and the facts which are expected to be proved by the State in support thereof.
    
    4. The testimony on the part of the State shall be offered.
    
    5. The nature of the defenses relied upon and the facts expected to be proved in their support shall be stated by defendant's counsel.
    
    6. The testimony on the part of the defendant shall be offered.
    
    7. Rebutting testimony may be offered on the part of each party.
    
    8. In the event of a finding of guilty, the trial shall then proceed as set forth in Article [37.07](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=37.07).
    
    (b) The defendant's counsel may make the opening statement for the defendant immediately after the attorney representing the State makes the opening statement for the State.

    Art. 36.03. INVOCATION OF RULE.  (a)  Notwithstanding Rule 614, Texas Rules of Evidence, a court at the request of a party may order the exclusion of a witness who for the purposes of the prosecution is a victim, close relative of a deceased victim, or guardian of a victim only if the witness is to testify and the court determines that the testimony of the witness would be materially affected if the witness hears other testimony at the trial.
    
    (b)  On the objection of the opposing party, the court may require the party requesting exclusion of a witness under Subsection (a) to make an offer of proof to justify the exclusion.

    Art. 36.14. CHARGE OF COURT.  Subject to the provisions of Article [36.07](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=36.07) in each felony case and in each misdemeanor case tried in a court of record, the judge shall, before the argument begins, deliver to the jury, except in pleas of guilty, where a jury has been waived, a written charge distinctly setting forth the law applicable to the case;  not expressing any opinion as to the weight of the evidence, not summing up the testimony, discussing the facts or using any argument in his charge calculated to arouse the sympathy or excite the passions of the jury.  Before said charge is read to the jury, the defendant or his counsel shall have a reasonable time to examine the same and he shall present his objections thereto in writing, distinctly specifying each ground of objection.  Said objections may embody errors claimed to have been committed in the charge, as well as errors claimed to have been committed by omissions therefrom or in failing to charge upon issues arising from the facts, and in no event shall it be necessary for the defendant or his counsel to present special requested charges to preserve or maintain any error assigned to the charge, as herein provided.  The requirement that the objections to the court's charge be in writing will be complied with if the objections are dictated to the court reporter in the presence of the court and the state's counsel, before the reading of the court's charge to the jury.  Compliance with the provisions of this Article is all that is necessary to preserve, for review, the exceptions and objections presented to the charge and any amendment or modification thereof.  In no event shall it be necessary for the defendant to except to the action of the court in over-ruling defendant's exceptions or objections to the charge.

    Art. 36.15. REQUESTED SPECIAL CHARGES.  Before the court reads his charge to the jury, counsel on both sides shall have a reasonable time to present written instructions and ask that they be given to the jury.  The requirement that the instructions be in writing is complied with if the instructions are dictated to the court reporter in the presence of the court and the state's counsel, before the reading of the court's charge to the jury.  The court shall give or refuse these charges.  The defendant may, by a special requested instruction, call the trial court's attention to error in the charge, as well as omissions therefrom, and no other exception or objection to the court's charge shall be necessary to preserve any error reflected by any special requested instruction which the trial court refuses.
    
    Any special requested charge which is granted shall be incorporated in the main charge and shall be treated as a part thereof, and the jury shall not be advised that it is a special requested charge of either party.  The judge shall read to the jury only such special charges as he gives.
    
    When the defendant has leveled objections to the charge or has requested instructions or both, and the court thereafter modifies his charge and rewrites the same and in so doing does not respond to objections or requested charges, or any of them, then the objections or requested charges shall not be deemed to have been waived by the party making or requesting the same, but shall be deemed to continue to have been urged by the party making or requesting the same unless the contrary is shown by the record;  no exception by the defendant to the action of the court shall be necessary or required in order to preserve for review the error claimed in the charge.

    Art. 36.16. FINAL CHARGE.  After the judge shall have received the objections to his main charge, together with any special charges offered, he may make such changes in his main charge as he may deem proper, and the defendant or his counsel shall have the opportunity to present their objections thereto and in the same manner as is provided in Article [36.15](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=36.15), and thereupon the judge shall read his charge to the jury as finally written, together with any special charges given, and no further exception or objection shall be required of the defendant in order to preserve any objections or exceptions theretofore made.  After the argument begins no further charge shall be given to the jury unless required by the improper argument of counsel or the request of the jury, or unless the judge shall, in his discretion, permit the introduction of other testimony, and in the event of such further charge, the defendant or his counsel shall have the right to present objections in the same manner as is prescribed in Article [36.15](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=36.15).  The failure of the court to give the defendant or his counsel a reasonable time to examine the charge and specify the ground of objection shall be subject to review either in the trial court or in the appellate court.

All objections to the charge and to the refusal of special charges shall be made at the time of the trial.

Except as provided in Subsection (b), however, after the trial of any felony case begins and a juror dies or, as determined by the judge, becomes disabled from sitting at any time before the charge of the court is read to the jury, the remainder of the jury shall have the power to render the verdict;  but when the verdict shall be rendered by less than the whole number, it shall be signed by every member of the jury concurring in it.
    
    (b) If alternate jurors have been selected in a capital case in which the state seeks the death penalty and a juror dies or becomes disabled from sitting at any time before the charge of the court is read to the jury, the alternate juror whose name was called first under Article [35.26](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=35.26) of this code shall replace the dead or disabled juror.

If a verdict is rendered by less than the whole number of the jury, each member of the jury shall sign the verdict.
    
    (d)  After the jury has rendered a verdict on the guilt or innocence of the defendant and, if applicable, the amount of punishment, the court shall discharge an alternate juror who has not replaced a juror.
