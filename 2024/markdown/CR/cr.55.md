    (a)  A person who has been placed under a custodial or noncustodial arrest for commission of either a felony or misdemeanor is entitled to have all records and files relating to the arrest expunged if:
    
    (1)  the person is tried for the offense for which the person was arrested and is:
    
    (A)  acquitted by the trial court, except as provided by Subsection (c);
    
    (B)  convicted and subsequently:
    
    (i)  pardoned for a reason other than that described by Subparagraph (ii); or
    
    (ii)  pardoned or otherwise granted relief on the basis of actual innocence with respect to that offense, if the applicable pardon or court order clearly indicates on its face that the pardon or order was granted or rendered on the basis of the person's actual innocence; or
    
    (C)  convicted of an offense committed before September 1, 2021, under Section [46.02](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=46.02)(a), Penal Code, as that section existed before that date; or
    
    (2)  the person has been released and the charge, if any, has not resulted in a final conviction and is no longer pending and there was no court-ordered community supervision under Chapter [42A](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=42A) for the offense, unless the offense is a Class C misdemeanor, provided that:
    
    (A)  regardless of whether any statute of limitations exists for the offense and whether any limitations period for the offense has expired, an indictment or information charging the person with the commission of a misdemeanor offense based on the person's arrest or charging the person with the commission of any felony offense arising out of the same transaction for which the person was arrested:
    
    (i)  has not been presented against the person at any time following the arrest, and:
    
    (a)  at least 180 days have elapsed from the date of arrest if the arrest for which the expunction was sought was for an offense punishable as a Class C misdemeanor and if there was no felony charge arising out of the same transaction for which the person was arrested;
    
    (b)  at least one year has elapsed from the date of arrest if the arrest for which the expunction was sought was for an offense punishable as a Class B or A misdemeanor and if there was no felony charge arising out of the same transaction for which the person was arrested;
    
    (c)  at least three years have elapsed from the date of arrest if the arrest for which the expunction was sought was for an offense punishable as a felony or if there was a felony charge arising out of the same transaction for which the person was arrested; or
    
    (d)  the attorney representing the state certifies that the applicable arrest records and files are not needed for use in any criminal investigation or prosecution, including an investigation or prosecution of another person; or
    
    (ii)  if presented at any time following the arrest, was dismissed or quashed, and the court finds that the indictment or information was dismissed or quashed because:
    
    (a)  the person completed a veterans treatment court program created under Chapter [124](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=124), Government Code, or former law, subject to Subsection (a-3);
    
    (b)  the person completed a mental health court program created under Chapter [125](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=125), Government Code, or former law, subject to Subsection (a-4);
    
    (c)  the person completed a pretrial intervention program authorized under Section [76.011](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=76.011), Government Code, other than a veterans treatment court program created under Chapter [124](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=124), Government Code, or former law, or a mental health court program created under Chapter [125](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=125), Government Code, or former law;
    
    (d)  the presentment had been made because of mistake, false information, or other similar reason indicating absence of probable cause at the time of the dismissal to believe the person committed the offense; or
    
    (e)  the indictment or information was void; or
    
    (B)  prosecution of the person for the offense for which the person was arrested is no longer possible because the limitations period has expired.
