    (b) The employer of a defendant participating in a program under this article shall pay the defendant's salary to the sheriff.  The sheriff shall deposit the salary into a special fund to be given to the defendant on his release after deducting:
    
    (1) the cost to the county for the defendant's confinement during the pay period based on the average daily cost of confining defendants in the county jail, as determined by the commissioners court of the county;
    
    (2) support of the defendant's dependents;  and
    
    (3) restitution to the victims of an offense committed by the defendant.
    
    (c) At the time of sentencing or at a later date, the court sentencing a defendant may direct the sheriff not to deduct the cost described under Subdivision (1) of Subsection (b) of this section or to deduct only a specified portion of the cost if the court determines that the full deduction would cause a significant financial hardship to the defendant's dependents.
    
    (d)  If the sheriff does not find employment for a defendant who would otherwise be sentenced to imprisonment in the department, the sheriff shall:
    
    (1)  transfer the defendant to the sheriff of a county who agrees to accept the defendant as a participant in the county jail work release program; or
    
    (2)  retain the defendant in the county jail for employment as soon as possible in a jail work release program.
    
    Sec. 2. A defendant participating in a program under this article shall be confined in the county jail or in another facility designated by the sheriff at all times except for:
    
    (1) time spent at work and traveling to or from work;  and
    
    (2) time spent attending or traveling to or from an education or rehabilitation program approved by the sheriff.
    
    Sec. 3.  (a)  The sheriff of each county shall classify each felon serving a sentence in the county jail work release program for the purpose of awarding good conduct time credit in the same manner as inmates of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice are classified under Chapter [498](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=498), Government Code, and shall award good conduct time in the same manner as the director of the department does in that chapter.
    
    (b) If the sheriff determines that the defendant is conducting himself in a manner that is dangerous to inmates in the county jail or to society as a whole, the sheriff may remove the defendant from participation in the program pending a hearing before the sentencing court.  At the hearing, if the court determines that the sheriff's assessment of the defendant's conduct is correct, the court may terminate the defendant's participation in the program and order the defendant to the term of imprisonment that the defendant would have received had he not entered the program.  If the court determines that the sheriff's assessment is incorrect, the court shall order the sheriff to readmit the defendant to the program.  A defendant shall receive as credit toward his sentence any time served as a participant in the program.

    Art. 42.037.  RESTITUTION.  (a)  In addition to any fine authorized by law, the court that sentences a defendant convicted of an offense may order the defendant to make restitution to any victim of the offense or to the compensation to victims of crime fund established under Subchapter [J](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=56B.451), Chapter [56B](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=56B), to the extent that fund has paid compensation to or on behalf of the victim.  If the court does not order restitution or orders partial restitution under this subsection, the court shall state on the record the reasons for not making the order or for the limited order.
    
    (b)(1)  If the offense results in damage to or loss or destruction of property of a victim of the offense, the court may order the defendant:
    
    (A)  to return the property to the owner of the property or someone designated by the owner; or
    
    (B)  if return of the property is impossible or impractical or is an inadequate remedy, to pay an amount equal to the greater of:
    
    (i)  the value of the property on the date of the damage, loss, or destruction; or
    
    (ii)  the value of the property on the date of sentencing, less the value of any part of the property that is returned on the date the property is returned.
    
    (2)  If the offense results in personal injury to a victim, the court may order the defendant to make restitution to:
    
    (A)  the victim for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the offense; or
    
    (B)  the compensation to victims of crime fund to the extent that fund has paid compensation to or on behalf of the victim.
    
    (3)  If the victim or the victim's estate consents, the court may, in addition to an order under Subdivision (2), order the defendant to make restitution by performing services instead of by paying money or make restitution to a person or organization, other than the compensation to victims of crime fund, designated by the victim or the estate.
    
    (c)  The court, in determining whether to order restitution and the amount of restitution, shall consider:
    
    (1)  the amount of the loss sustained by any victim and the amount paid to or on behalf of the victim by the compensation to victims of crime fund as a result of the offense; and
    
    (2)   other factors the court deems appropriate.
    
    (d)  If the court orders restitution under this article and the victim is deceased the court shall order the defendant to make restitution to the victim's estate.
    
    (e)  The court shall impose an order of restitution that is as fair as possible to the victim or to the compensation to victims of crime fund, as applicable.  The imposition of the order may not unduly complicate or prolong the sentencing process.
    
    (f)(1)  The court may not order restitution for a loss for which the victim has received or will receive compensation only from a source other than the compensation to victims of crime fund.  The court may, in the interest of justice, order restitution to any person who has compensated the victim for the loss to the extent the person paid compensation.  An order of restitution shall require that all restitution to a victim or to the compensation to victims of crime fund be made before any restitution to any other person is made under the order.
    
    (2)  Any amount recovered by a victim from a person ordered to pay restitution in a federal or state civil proceeding is reduced by any amount previously paid to the victim by the person under an order of restitution.
    
    (g)  The court may require a defendant to make restitution under this article within a specified period or in specified installments.   The end of the period or the last installment may not be later than:
    
    (1)  the end of the period of probation, if probation is ordered;
    
    (2)  five years after the end of the term of imprisonment imposed, if the court does not order probation; or
    
    (3)  five years after the date of sentencing in any other case.
    
    (g-1)  If the court does not provide otherwise, the defendant shall make restitution immediately.
    
    (g-2)  Except as provided by Subsection (n), the order of restitution must require the defendant to:
    
    (1)  make restitution directly to the person or agency that will accept and forward restitution payments to the victim or other person eligible for restitution under this article, including the compensation to victims of crime fund;
    
    (2)  make restitution directly to the victim or other person eligible for restitution under this article, including the compensation to victims of crime fund; or
    
    (3)  deliver the amount or property due as restitution to a community supervision and corrections department for transfer to the victim or person.
    
    (h)  If a defendant is placed on community supervision or is paroled or released on mandatory supervision, the court or the parole panel shall order the payment of restitution ordered under this article as a condition of community supervision, parole, or mandatory supervision.  The court may revoke community supervision and the parole panel may revoke parole or mandatory supervision if the defendant fails to comply with the order.  In determining whether to revoke community supervision, parole, or mandatory supervision, the court or parole panel shall consider:
    
    (1)  the defendant's employment status;
    
    (2)  the defendant's current and future earning ability;
    
    (3)  the defendant's current and future financial resources;
    
    (4)  the willfulness of the defendant's failure to pay;
    
    (5)  any other special circumstances that may affect the defendant's ability to pay; and
    
    (6)  the victim's financial resources or ability to pay expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the offense.
    
    (i)  In addition to any other terms and conditions of community supervision imposed under Chapter [42A](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=42A), the court may require a defendant to reimburse the compensation to victims of crime fund created under Subchapter [J](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=56B.451), Chapter [56B](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=56B), for any amounts paid from that fund to or on behalf of a victim of the defendant's offense.  In this subsection, "victim" has the meaning assigned by Article [56B.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=56B.003).
    
    (j)  The court may order a community supervision and corrections department to obtain information pertaining to the factors listed in Subsection (c).  The supervision officer shall include the information in the report required under Article [42A.252](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=42A.252)(a) or a separate report, as the court directs.  The court shall permit the defendant and the prosecuting attorney to read the report.
    
    (k)  The court shall resolve any dispute relating to the proper amount or type of restitution.  The standard of proof is a preponderance of the evidence.  The burden of demonstrating the amount of the loss sustained by a victim as a result of the offense is on the prosecuting attorney.  The burden of demonstrating the financial resources of the defendant and the financial needs of the defendant and the defendant's dependents is on the defendant.  The burden of demonstrating other matters as the court deems appropriate is on the party designated by the court as justice requires.
    
    (l)  Conviction of a defendant for an offense involving the act giving rise to restitution under this article estops the defendant from denying the essential allegations of that offense in any subsequent federal civil proceeding or state civil proceeding brought by the victim, to the extent consistent with state law.
    
    (m)  An order of restitution may be enforced by the state or a victim named in the order to receive the restitution in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action.
    
    (n)  If a defendant is convicted of or receives deferred adjudication for an offense under Section [25.05](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=25.05), Penal Code, if the child support order on which prosecution of the offense was based required the defendant to pay the support to a local registry or the Title IV-D agency, and if the court orders restitution under this article, the order of restitution must require the defendant to pay the child support in the following manner:
    
    (1)  during any period in which the defendant is under the supervision of a community supervision and corrections department, to the department for transfer to the local registry or Title IV-D agency designated as the place of payment in the child support order; and
    
    (2)  during any period in which the defendant is not under the supervision of a department, directly to the registry or agency described by Subdivision (1).
    
    (o)  The department may waive a supervision fee or an administrative fee imposed on an inmate under Section [508.182](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=508.182), Government Code, during any period in which the inmate is required to pay restitution under this article.
    
    (p)(1)  A court shall order a defendant convicted of an offense under Section [28.03](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=28.03)(f), Penal Code, involving damage or destruction inflicted on a place of human burial or under Section [42.08](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=42.08), Penal Code, to make restitution in the amount described by Subsection (b)(1)(B) to a cemetery organization operating a cemetery affected by the commission of the offense.
    
    (2)  If a court orders an unemancipated minor to make restitution under Subsection (a) and the minor is financially unable to make the restitution, the court may order:
    
    (A)  the minor to perform a specific number of hours of community service to satisfy the restitution; or
    
    (B)  the parents or other person responsible for the minor's support to make the restitution in the amount described by Subsection (b)(1)(B).
    
    (3)  In this subsection, "cemetery" and "cemetery organization" have the meanings assigned by Section [711.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=711.001), Health and Safety Code.
    
    (q)  The court shall order a defendant convicted of an offense under Section [22.11](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=22.11), Penal Code, to make restitution to the victim of the offense or the victim's employer in an amount equal to the sum of any expenses incurred by the victim or employer to:
    
    (1)  test the victim for HIV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, tuberculosis, or any other disease designated as a reportable disease under Section [81.048](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=81.048), Health and Safety Code; or
    
    (2)  treat the victim for HIV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, tuberculosis, or any other disease designated as a reportable disease under Section [81.048](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=81.048), Health and Safety Code, the victim contracts as a result of the offense.

    Art. 42.038. REIMBURSEMENT FOR CONFINEMENT EXPENSES.  (a)  In addition to any fine, cost, or fee authorized by law, a court that sentences a defendant convicted of a misdemeanor to serve a term of confinement in county jail and orders execution of the sentence may require the defendant to reimburse the county for the defendant's confinement at a rate of $25 a day.
    
    (b) A court that requires a defendant convicted of a misdemeanor or placed on deferred adjudication for a misdemeanor to submit to a period of confinement in county jail as a condition of community supervision may also require as a condition of community supervision that the defendant reimburse the county for the defendant's confinement, with the amount of reimbursement determined as if the defendant were serving an executed sentence.
    
    (c) A judge may not require reimbursement under this article if the judge determines the defendant is indigent based on the defendant's sworn statement or affidavit filed with the court.  A court that requires reimbursement under this article may require the defendant to reimburse the county only for those days the defendant is confined after the date of conviction or on which a plea of guilty or nolo contendere was entered.  The court may not require a defendant to reimburse the county for those days the defendant was confined after arrest and before the date of conviction or on which the plea of guilty or nolo contendere was entered.
    
    (d) The court, in determining whether to order reimbursement under this article, shall consider:
    
    (1) the defendant's employment status, earning ability, and financial resources;  and
    
    (2) any other special circumstances that may affect the defendant's ability to pay, including child support obligations and including any financial responsibilities owed by the defendant to dependents or restitution payments owed by the defendant to a victim.

For purposes of this subsection, a defendant who is confined in county jail for only a portion of a day is nonetheless considered to have been confined for the whole day.
    
    (f) The court may require a defendant to reimburse the county under this article by paying to the sheriff the bill presented by the sheriff within a specified period or in specified installments.  The end of the period or the last installment may not be later than:
    
    (1) the end of the period of community supervision, if community supervision is ordered;  or
    
    (2) the fifth anniversary of the last day of the term of confinement, if the court does not order community supervision.

    (2)  the defendant is subject to an immigration detainer request.

In the absence of an order issued under this subsection, a facility or officer acting under exigent circumstances may perform the transfer after making the determination described by this subsection.  This subsection applies only if appropriate officers of the federal government consent to the transfer of the defendant into federal custody under the circumstances described by this subsection.
    
    (c)  If the applicable information described by Subsection (a)(2) is not available at the time sentence is pronounced in the case, the judge shall issue the order described by Subsection (b) as soon as the information becomes available.

Except as provided by Subsections (b) and (c), in the discretion of the court, the judgment in the second and subsequent convictions may either be that the sentence imposed or suspended shall begin when the judgment and the sentence imposed or suspended in the preceding conviction has ceased to operate, or that the sentence imposed or suspended shall run concurrently with the other case or cases, and sentence and execution shall be accordingly; provided, however, that the cumulative total of suspended sentences in felony cases shall not exceed 10 years, and the cumulative total of suspended sentences in misdemeanor cases shall not exceed the maximum period of confinement in jail applicable to the misdemeanor offenses, though in no event more than three years, including extensions of periods of community supervision under Article [42A.752](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=42A.752)(a)(2), if none of the offenses are offenses under Chapter [49](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=49), Penal Code, or four years, including extensions, if any of the offenses are offenses under Chapter [49](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=49), Penal Code.

    (B)  if the defendant's parole or mandatory supervision has been revoked, commence immediately on completion of the sentence for the offense for which the defendant was released on parole or to mandatory supervision.
    
    (2)  A judge who orders a sentence to be imposed consecutively in the manner described by Subdivision (1)(B) shall, on pronouncing the sentence, order the defendant transferred to the custody of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice for purposes of serving the applicable sentences consecutively as described by that subdivision if the defendant has not been taken into custody by the department following the revocation of the defendant's parole or mandatory supervision.

    (a) Whenever the duly constituted authorities in a state party to this compact, and which has entered into a contract pursuant to Article III, shall decide that confinement in, or transfer of an inmate to, an institution within the territory of another party state is necessary or desirable in order to provide adequate quarters and care or an appropriate program of rehabilitation or treatment, such official may direct that the confinement be within an institution within the territory of such other party state, the receiving state to act in that regard solely as agent for the sending state.
    
    (b) The appropriate officials of any state party to this compact shall have access, at all reasonable times, to any institution in which it has a contractual right to confine inmates for the purpose of inspecting the facilities thereof and visiting such of its inmates as may be confined in the institution.

    (d) Each receiving state shall provide regular reports to each sending state on the inmates of that sending state who are in institutions pursuant to this compact including a conduct record of each inmate and shall certify such record to the official designated by the sending state, in order that each inmate may have official review of his or her record in determining and altering the disposition of the inmate in accordance with the law which may obtain in the sending state and in order that the same may be a source of information for the sending state.
    
    (e) All inmates who may be confined in an institution pursuant to this compact shall be treated in a reasonable and humane manner and shall be treated equally with such similar inmates of the receiving state as may be confined in the same institution.

    (f) Any hearing or hearings to which an inmate confined pursuant to this compact may be entitled by the laws of the sending state may be had before the appropriate authorities of the sending state, or of the receiving state if authorized by the sending state.  The receiving state shall provide adequate facilities for such hearing as may be conducted by the appropriate officials of a sending state.  In the event such hearing or hearings are had before officials of the receiving state, the governing law shall be that of the sending state and a record of the hearing or hearings as prescribed by the sending state shall be made.  The record together with any recommendations of the hearing officials shall be transmitted forthwith to the official or officials before whom the hearing would have been had if it had taken place in the sending state.

    (b) An inmate who escapes from an institution in which he is confined pursuant to this compact shall be deemed a fugitive from the sending state and from the state in which the institution escaped from is situated.  In the case of an escape to a jurisdiction other than the sending or receiving state, the responsibility for institution of extradition or rendition proceedings shall be that of the sending state, but nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies of any jurisdiction directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee.

Any inmate in a receiving state pursuant to this compact may participate in any such federally aided program or activity for which the sending and receiving states have made contractual provision.  However, if such program or activity is not part of the customary correctional regimen, the express consent of the appropriate official of the sending state shall be required therefor.

Before the effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawal state shall remove to its territory, at its own expense, such inmates as it may have confined pursuant to the provisions of this compact.
    
    Article IX. Other Arrangements Unaffected
    
      
    
    
    Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to abrogate or impair an agreement or other arrangement which a party state may have with a nonparty state for the confinement, rehabilitation, or treatment of inmates, nor to repeal any other laws of a party state authorizing the making of cooperative institutional arrangements.

    (b) Powers.  The director of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice is authorized and directed to do all things necessary or incidental to the carrying out of the compact in every particular.

    (1)  the name of the person entitled to restitution;
    
    (2)  the name of the defendant obligated to pay restitution, fines, or costs;
    
    (3)  the amount of the lien; and
    
    (4)  the name of the court that ordered restitution.
    
    (h)  A person who files an affidavit to perfect a restitution lien under this article shall notify in writing the clerk of the court entering the judgment creating the lien of all officers or entities with which the affidavit was filed.
    
    Sec. 8.  SUBJECT PROPERTY.  A restitution lien extends to:
    
    (1)  any interest of the defendant in real property whether then owned or after-acquired located in a county in which the lien is perfected by the filing of an affidavit with the county clerk;
    
    (2)  any interest of the defendant in tangible or intangible personal property whether then owned or after-acquired other than a motor vehicle if the lien is perfected by the filing of the affidavit with the secretary of state; or
    
    (3)  any interest of the defendant in a motor vehicle whether then owned or after-acquired if the lien is perfected by the filing of the affidavit with the department.
    
    Sec. 9.  PRIORITY.  The perfection of a restitution lien under this article is notice of the claim to all persons dealing with the defendant or the property identified in the affidavit perfecting the lien.  Without regard to whether perfected before or after the perfection of a restitution lien filed and perfected under this article, a perfected real estate mortgage lien, a vendor's lien, a purchase money security interest, a chattel paper security interest, a lien on a motor vehicle perfected as provided by Chapter [501](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=501), Transportation Code, or a worker's lien perfected in the manner provided by law is superior and prior to a restitution lien filed and perfected under this article.  Except as provided by this article, a perfected lien in favor of a victim is superior and prior to a lien perfected by the state under this article, and the perfected lien in favor of the state is superior and prior to the claim or interest of any other person, other than:
    
    (1)  a person who acquires a valid lien or security interest perfected before the perfection of the restitution lien;
    
    (2)  a bona fide purchaser who acquires an interest in the property, if personal property, before the filing of the restitution lien, to the extent that the purchaser gives value; or
    
    (3)  a bona fide purchaser for value who acquires and files for record an interest in the property, if real property, before the perfection of the restitution lien.
    
    Sec. 10.  PAYMENT.  The clerk receiving a payment from a defendant ordered to pay restitution shall make payments to the person having an interest in the restitution lien on a schedule of not less than quarterly payments as determined by the clerk or agency.
    
    Sec. 11.  FORECLOSURE.  If a defendant fails to timely make a payment required by the order of the court entering the judgment creating the restitution lien, the person having an interest in the lien may file suit in a court of competent jurisdiction to foreclose the lien.  If the defendant cures the default on or before the 20th day after the date the suit is filed and pays the person who files the suit costs of court and reasonable attorney's fees, the court may dismiss the suit without prejudice to the person.  The person may refile the suit against the defendant if the defendant subsequently defaults.
    
    Sec. 12.  EXPIRATION; RECORDS.  (a)  A restitution lien expires on the 10th anniversary of the date the lien was filed or on the date the defendant satisfies the judgment creating the lien, whichever occurs first.  The person having an interest in the lien may refile the lien before the date the lien expires.  A lien that is refiled expires on the 10th anniversary of the date the lien was refiled or the date the defendant satisfies the judgment creating the lien, whichever occurs first.
    
    (b)  Failure to execute or foreclose the restitution lien does not cause dormancy of the lien.
    
    (c)  The clerk of the court entering the judgment creating the restitution lien shall maintain a record of the outstanding balance of restitution, fines, or costs owed.  If the defendant satisfies the judgment, the clerk shall immediately execute and file for record a release of the restitution lien with all officers or entities with which the affidavit perfecting the lien was filed, as indicated by the notice received by the clerk under Section 7(h) of this article, unless a release was executed and filed by the person who filed the affidavit to perfect the lien.
    
    (d)  A partial release of a lien as to specific property may be executed by the attorney representing the state or a magistrate who signs an affidavit described by Section 6 of this article on payment of a sum determined to represent the defendant's interest in any property to which the lien may attach.
