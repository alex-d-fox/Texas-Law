    (b) There may be only one medical examiner in a medical examiners district, although he may employ, within the district, necessary staff personnel.  When a county becomes a part of a medical examiners district, the effect is the same within the county as if the office of medical examiner had been established in that county alone.

    (b)  To the greatest extent possible, the medical examiner shall be appointed from persons having training and experience in pathology, toxicology, histology and other medico-legal sciences.
    
    (c)  The medical examiner shall devote the time and energy necessary to perform the duties conferred by this Article.
    
    Sec. 3. ASSISTANTS.

    4.  When the circumstances of the death of any person are such as to lead to suspicion that he came to his death by unlawful means;
    
    5.  When any person commits suicide, or the circumstances of his death are such as to lead to suspicion that he committed suicide;
    
    6.  When a person dies without having been attended by a duly licensed and practicing physician, and the local health officer or registrar required to report the cause of death under Section [193.005](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=193.005), Health and Safety Code, does not know the cause of death.  When the local health officer or registrar of vital statistics whose duty it is to certify the cause of death does not know the cause of death, he shall so notify the medical examiner of the county in which the death occurred and request an inquest;
    
    7.  When the person is a child who is younger than six years of age and the death is reported under Chapter [264](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=264), Family Code; and

    (c) In making such investigations and holding such inquests, the medical examiner or an authorized deputy may administer oaths and take affidavits.

(a)  When death occurs to an individual designated a prospective organ donor for transplantation by a licensed physician under circumstances requiring the medical examiner of the county in which death occurred, or the medical examiner's authorized deputy, to hold an inquest, the medical examiner, or a member of his staff will be so notified by the administrative head of the facility in which the transplantation is to be performed.
    
    (b) When notified pursuant to Subsection (a) of this Section, the medical examiner or the medical examiner's deputy shall perform an inquest on the deceased prospective organ donor.

(a)  Any police officer, superintendent or general manager of an institution, physician, or private citizen who shall become aware of a death under any of the circumstances set out in Section 6(a) of this Article, shall immediately report such death to the office of the medical examiner or to the city or county police departments;  any such report to a city or county police department shall be immediately transmitted to the office of the medical examiner.
    
    (b) A person investigating a death described by Subdivision 3(B) of Section 6(a) shall report the death to the missing children and missing persons information clearinghouse of the Department of Public Safety and the national crime information center not later than the 10th working day after the date the investigation began.
    
    (c) A superintendent or general manager of an institution who reports a death under Subsection (a) must comply with the notice and reporting requirements of Article [49.24](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=49.24).  The office of the attorney general has the same powers and duties provided the office under that article regarding the dissemination and investigation of the report.
    
    (d)  A person investigating a death described by Section 6(a)(3)(B), or the person's designee, shall, not later than the 10th working day after the date that one or more identifying features of the unidentified body are determined or the 60th day after the date the investigation began, whichever is earlier, enter all available identifying features of the unidentified body (fingerprints, dental records, any unusual physical characteristics, and a description of the clothing found on the body) into the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System.
    
    Sec. 8. REMOVAL OF BODIES.  When any death under circumstances set out in Section 6 shall have occurred, the body shall not be disturbed or removed from the position in which it is found by any person without authorization from the medical examiner or authorized deputy, except for the purpose of preserving such body from loss or destruction or maintaining the flow of traffic on a highway, railroad or airport.
    
    Sec. 9. AUTOPSY.    (a)  If the cause of death shall be determined beyond a reasonable doubt as a result of the investigation, the medical examiner shall file a report thereof setting forth specifically the cause of death with the district attorney or criminal district attorney, or in a county in which there is no district attorney or criminal district attorney with the county attorney, of the county in which the death occurred.  If in the opinion of the medical examiner an autopsy is necessary, or if such is requested by the district attorney or criminal district attorney, or county attorney where there is no district attorney or criminal district attorney, the autopsy shall be immediately performed by the medical examiner or a duly authorized deputy.  In those cases where a complete autopsy is deemed unnecessary by the medical examiner to ascertain the cause of death, the medical examiner may perform a limited autopsy involving the taking of blood samples or any other samples of body fluids, tissues or organs, in order to ascertain the cause of death or whether a crime has been committed.  In the case of a body of a human being whose identity is unknown, the medical examiner may authorize such investigative and laboratory tests and processes as are required to determine its identity as well as the cause of death.  In performing an autopsy the medical examiner or authorized deputy may use the facilities of any city or county hospital within the county or such other facilities as are made available.  Upon completion of the autopsy, the medical examiner shall file a report setting forth the findings in detail with the office of the district attorney or criminal district attorney of the county, or if there is no district attorney or criminal district attorney, with the county attorney of the county.
    
    (b) A medical examination on an unidentified person shall include the following information to enable a timely and accurate identification of the person:

    (2) dental charts and radiographs (X-rays) of the person's teeth;
    
    (3) frontal and lateral facial photographs with scale indicated;
    
    (4) notation and photographs, with scale indicated, of a significant scar, mark, tattoo, or item of clothing or other personal effect found with or near the body;
    
    (5) notation of antemortem medical conditions;
    
    (6) notation of observations pertinent to the estimation of time of death;  and
    
    (7) precise documentation of the location of burial of the remains.
    
    (c) A medical examination on an unidentified person may include the following information to enable a timely and accurate identification of the person:
    
    (1) full body radiographs (X-rays);  and
    
    (2) hair specimens with roots.
    
    Sec. 10. DISINTERMENTS AND CREMATIONS.  When a body upon which an inquest ought to have been held has been interred, the medical examiner may cause it to be disinterred for the purpose of holding such inquest.
    
    Before any body, upon which an inquest is authorized by the provisions of this Article, can be lawfully cremated, an autopsy shall be performed thereon as provided in this Article, or a certificate that no autopsy was necessary shall be furnished by the medical examiner.  Before any dead body can be lawfully cremated, the owner or operator of the crematory shall demand and be furnished with a certificate, signed by the medical examiner of the county in which the death occurred showing that an autopsy was performed on said body or that no autopsy thereon was necessary.  It shall be the duty of the medical examiner to determine whether or not, from all the circumstances surrounding the death, an autopsy is necessary prior to issuing a certificate under the provisions of this section.  No autopsy shall be required by the medical examiner as a prerequisite to cremation in case death is caused by the pestilential diseases of Asiatic cholera, bubonic plague, typhus fever, or smallpox.  All certificates furnished to the owner or operator of a crematory by any medical examiner, under the terms of this Article, shall be preserved by such owner or operator of such crematory for a period of two years from the date of the cremation of said body.  A medical examiner is not required to perform an autopsy on the body of a deceased person whose death was caused by a communicable disease during a public health disaster.
    
    Sec. 10a. WAITING PERIOD BETWEEN DEATH AND CREMATION.  The body of a deceased person shall not be cremated within 48 hours after the time of death as indicated on the regular death certificate, unless the death certificate indicates death was caused by the pestilential diseases of Asiatic cholera, bubonic plague, typhus fever, or smallpox, or unless the time requirement is waived in writing by the county medical examiner or, in counties not having a county medical examiner, a justice of the peace.  In a public health disaster, the commissioner of public health may designate other communicable diseases for which cremation within 48 hours of the time of death is authorized.
    
    Sec. 10b. DISPOSAL OF UNIDENTIFIED BODY.  If the body of a deceased person is unidentified, a person may not cremate or direct the cremation of the body under this article.  If the body is buried, the investigating agency responsible for the burial shall record and maintain for not less than 10 years all information pertaining to the body and the location of burial.
    
    Sec. 11.  RECORDS.  (a)  The medical examiner shall keep full and complete records properly indexed, giving the name if known of every person whose death is investigated, the place where the body was found, the date, the cause and manner of death, and shall issue a death certificate.  The full report and detailed findings of the autopsy, if any, shall be a part of the record.  Copies of all records shall promptly be delivered to the proper district, county, or criminal district attorney in any case where further investigation is advisable.  The records may not be withheld, subject to a discretionary exception under Chapter [552](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552), Government Code, except that a photograph or x-ray of a body taken during an autopsy is excepted from required public disclosure in accordance with Chapter [552](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552), Government Code, but is subject to disclosure:
    
    (1)  under a subpoena or authority of other law; or
    
    (2)  if the photograph or x-ray is of the body of a person who died while in the custody of law enforcement.
    
    (b)  Under the exception to public disclosure provided by Subsection (a), a governmental body as defined by Section [552.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552.003), Government Code, may withhold a photograph or x-ray described by Subsection (a) without requesting a decision from the attorney general under Subchapter [G](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552.301), Chapter [552](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552), Government Code.  This subsection does not affect the required disclosure of a photograph or x-ray under Subsection (a)(1) or (2).
    
    (c)  The medical examiner may release a copy of an autopsy report of a deceased person to any organ and tissue procurement organization, hospital, or other covered entity as defined by Section [181.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=181.001), Health and Safety Code, that treated the deceased person before death or procured any anatomical gift from the body of the deceased person.  The release of a report under this subsection is not considered a disclosure under Chapter [552](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552), Government Code.  A report obtained under this subsection is confidential and not subject to disclosure under Chapter [552](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552), Government Code.
    
    Sec. 12. TRANSFER OF DUTIES OF JUSTICE OF PEACE.  When the commissioners court of any county shall establish the office of medical examiner, all powers and duties of justices of the peace in such county relating to the investigation of deaths and inquests shall vest in the office of the medical examiner.  Any subsequent General Law pertaining to the duties of justices of the peace in death investigations and inquests shall apply to the medical examiner in such counties as to the extent not inconsistent with this Article, and all laws or parts of laws otherwise in conflict herewith are hereby declared to be inapplicable to this Article.
    
    Sec. 13. USE OF FORENSIC ANTHROPOLOGIST.  On discovering the body or body part of a deceased person in the circumstances described by Subdivision 3(B) of Section 6(a), the medical examiner may request the aid of a forensic anthropologist in the examination of the body or body part.  The forensic anthropologist must hold a doctoral degree in anthropology with an emphasis in physical anthropology.  The forensic anthropologist shall attempt to establish whether the body or body part is of a human or animal, whether evidence of childbirth, injury, or disease exists, and the sex, race, age, stature, and physical anomalies of the body or body part.  The forensic anthropologist may also attempt to establish the cause, manner, and time of death.
    
    Sec. 13A.  FEES.  (a)  A medical examiner may charge reasonable fees for services provided by the office of medical examiner under this article, including cremation approvals, court testimonies, consultations, and depositions.
    
    (b)  The commissioners court must approve the amount of the fee before the fee may be assessed.  The fee may not exceed the amount necessary to provide the services described by Subsection (a).
    
    (c)  The fee may not be assessed against the county's district attorney or a county office.
