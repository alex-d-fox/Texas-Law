The custodian of a municipal or county treasury who receives reimbursement fees collected under this subsection shall keep a record of the fees and, without deduction or proration, forward the fees to the comptroller, with and in the manner required for other fees and costs received in connection with criminal cases.  The comptroller shall credit fees received under this subsection to the Texas Department of Public Safety.

    (1)  require a defendant requesting a course under Subsection (b) to pay a reimbursement fee to cover the cost of administering this article in an amount of not more than $10; or

    (1) notify the defendant in writing, mailed to the address on file with the court or appearing on the notice to appear, of that failure;  and
    
    (2) require the defendant to appear at the time and place stated in the notice to show cause why the evidence was not timely submitted to the court.
    
    (j) If the defendant fails to appear at the time and place stated in the notice under Subsection (i), or appears at the time and place stated in the notice but does not show good cause for the defendant's failure to comply with Subsection (c), the court shall enter an adjudication of guilt and impose sentence.
    
    (k) On a defendant's showing of good cause for failure to furnish evidence to the court, the court may allow an extension of time during which the defendant may present:
    
    (1) a uniform certificate of course completion as evidence that the defendant successfully completed the driving safety course;  or
    
    (2) a verification of course completion as evidence that the defendant successfully completed the motorcycle operator training course.
    
    (l) When a defendant complies with Subsection (c), the court shall:
    
    (1) remove the judgment and dismiss the charge;
    
    (2) report the fact that the defendant successfully completed a driving safety course or a motorcycle operator training course and the date of completion to the Texas Department of Public Safety for inclusion in the person's driving record;  and
    
    (3) state in that report whether the course was taken under this article to provide information necessary to determine eligibility to take a subsequent course under Subsection (b).
    
    (m) The court may dismiss only one charge for each completion of a course.
    
    (n) A charge that is dismissed under this article may not be part of a person's driving record or used for any purpose.

The notice required by this subsection must read substantially as follows:
    
    "You may be able to require that this charge be dismissed by successfully completing a driving safety course or a motorcycle operator training course.  You will lose that right if, on or before your appearance date, you do not provide the court with notice of your request to take the course."
    
    (r) If the notice required by Subsection (q) is not provided to the defendant charged with the offense, the defendant may continue to exercise the defendant's right to take a driving safety course or a motorcycle operator training course until the notice required by Subsection (q) is provided to the defendant or there is a final disposition of the case.
    
    (s)  This article does not apply to an offense committed by a person who:

(a)  A justice or municipal court may defer proceedings against a defendant who is under the age of 18 or enrolled full time in an accredited secondary school in a program leading toward a high school diploma for not more than 180 days if the defendant:
    
    (1)  is charged with an offense that the court has jurisdiction of under Article [4.11](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=4.11) or [4.14](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=4.14);
    
    (2)  pleads nolo contendere or guilty to the offense in open court with the defendant's parent, guardian, or managing conservator present;
    
    (3)  presents to the court an oral or written request to attend a teen court program or is recommended to attend the program by a school employee under Section [37.146](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.146), Education Code; and
    
    (4)  has not successfully completed a teen court program in the year preceding the date that the alleged offense occurred.
    
    (b) The teen court program must be approved by the court.
    
    (c) A defendant for whom proceedings are deferred under Subsection (a) shall complete the teen court program not later than the 90th day after the date the teen court hearing to determine punishment is held or the last day of the deferral period, whichever date is earlier.  The justice or municipal court shall dismiss the charge at the time the defendant presents satisfactory evidence that the defendant has successfully completed the teen court program.
    
    (d) A charge dismissed under this article may not be part of the defendant's criminal record or driving record or used for any purpose.  However, if the charge was for a traffic offense, the court shall report to the Department of Public Safety that the defendant successfully completed the teen court program and the date of completion for inclusion in the defendant's driving record.
    
    (e)  The justice or municipal court may require a person who requests a teen court program to pay a reimbursement fee not to exceed $10 that is set by the court to cover the costs of administering this article.  Reimbursement fees collected by a municipal court shall be deposited in the municipal treasury.  Reimbursement fees collected by a justice court shall be deposited in the county treasury of the county in which the court is located.  A person who requests a teen court program and fails to complete the program is not entitled to a refund of the fee.
    
    (f) A court may transfer a case in which proceedings have been deferred under this section to a court in another county if the court to which the case is transferred consents.  A case may not be transferred unless it is within the jurisdiction of the court to which it is transferred.
    
    (g)  In addition to the reimbursement fee authorized by Subsection (e), the court may require a child who requests a teen court program to pay a $10 reimbursement fee to cover the cost to the teen court for performing its duties under this article.  The court shall pay the fee to the teen court program, and the teen court program must account to the court for the receipt and disbursal of the fee.  A child who pays a fee under this subsection is not entitled to a refund of the fee, regardless of whether the child successfully completes the teen court program.
    
    (h) A justice or municipal court may exempt a defendant for whom proceedings are deferred under this article from the requirement to pay a court cost or fee that is imposed by another statute.
    
    (i)  Notwithstanding Subsection (e) or (g), a justice or municipal court that is located in the Texas-Louisiana border region, as defined by Section [2056.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2056.002), Government Code, may charge a reimbursement fee of $20 under those subsections.
