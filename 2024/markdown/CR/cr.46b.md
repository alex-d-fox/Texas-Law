    (2) a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against the person.

    Art. 46B.004. RAISING ISSUE OF INCOMPETENCY TO STAND TRIAL.  (a)  Either party may suggest by motion, or the trial court may suggest on its own motion, that the defendant may be incompetent to stand trial.  A motion suggesting that the defendant may be incompetent to stand trial may be supported by affidavits setting out the facts on which the suggestion is made.
    
    (b) If evidence suggesting the defendant may be incompetent to stand trial comes to the attention of the court, the court on its own motion shall suggest that the defendant may be incompetent to stand trial.
    
    (c) On suggestion that the defendant may be incompetent to stand trial, the court shall determine by informal inquiry whether there is some evidence from any source that would support a finding that the defendant may be incompetent to stand trial.
    
    (c-1)  A suggestion of incompetency is the threshold requirement for an informal inquiry under Subsection (c) and may consist solely of a representation from any credible source that the defendant may be incompetent.  A further evidentiary showing is not required to initiate the inquiry, and the court is not required to have a bona fide doubt about the competency of the defendant.  Evidence suggesting the need for an informal inquiry may be based on observations made in relation to one or more of the factors described by Article [46B.024](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=46B.024) or on any other indication that the defendant is incompetent within the meaning of Article [46B.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=46B.003).
    
    (d)  If the court determines there is evidence to support a finding of incompetency, the court, except as provided by Subsection (e) and Article [46B.005](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=46B.005)(d), shall stay all other proceedings in the case.
    
    (e)  At any time during the proceedings under this chapter after the issue of the defendant's incompetency to stand trial is first raised, the court on the motion of the attorney representing the state may dismiss all charges pending against the defendant, regardless of whether there is any evidence to support a finding of the defendant's incompetency under Subsection (d) or whether the court has made a finding of incompetency under this chapter.  If the court dismisses the charges against the defendant, the court may not continue the proceedings under this chapter, except that, if there is evidence to support a finding of the defendant's incompetency under Subsection (d), the court may proceed under Subchapter F.  If the court does not elect to proceed under Subchapter F, the court shall discharge the defendant.

    Art. 46B.005.  DETERMINING INCOMPETENCY TO STAND TRIAL.  (a)  If after an informal inquiry the court determines that evidence exists to support a finding of incompetency, the court shall order an examination under Subchapter B to determine whether the defendant is incompetent to stand trial in a criminal case.
    
    (b)  Except as provided by Subsection (c), the court shall hold a trial under Subchapter C before determining whether the defendant is incompetent to stand trial on the merits.
    
    (c)  A trial under this chapter is not required if:
    
    (1)  neither party's counsel requests a trial on the issue of incompetency;
    
    (2)  neither party's counsel opposes a finding of incompetency; and
    
    (3)  the court does not, on its own motion, determine that a trial is necessary to determine incompetency.
    
    (d)  If the issue of the defendant's incompetency to stand trial is raised after the trial on the merits begins, the court may determine the issue at any time before the sentence is pronounced.  If the determination is delayed until after the return of a verdict, the court shall make the determination as soon as reasonably possible after the return.  If a verdict of not guilty is returned, the court may not determine the issue of incompetency.

The court is not required to appoint the same expert or experts who performed the initial examination of the defendant under that subchapter.
    
    (b)  If after a reexamination of the defendant the applicable expert's report states an opinion that the defendant remains incompetent, the court's order under Article [46B.0711](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=46B.0711), [46B.072](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=46B.072), or [46B.073](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=46B.073) remains in effect, and the defendant shall be transported to the facility or program as required by Article [46B.075](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=46B.075).

    (1)  both parties agree that the defendant is competent to stand trial;  and
    
    (2)  the court concurs.
    
    (d)  The court shall hold a hearing to determine whether the defendant has been restored to competency if any party fails to agree or if the court fails to concur that the defendant is competent to stand trial.  If a court holds a hearing under this subsection, on the request of the counsel for either party or the motion of the court, a jury shall make the competency determination.  For purposes of the hearing, incompetency is presumed, and the defendant's competency must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence.  If after the hearing the defendant is again found to be incompetent to stand trial, the court shall issue a new order under Article [46B.0711](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=46B.0711), [46B.072](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=46B.072), or [46B.073](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=46B.073), as appropriate based on the defendant's current condition.

    (2)  who either:
    
    (A)  remains confined in a correctional facility, as defined by Section [1.07](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=1.07), Penal Code, for a period exceeding 72 hours while awaiting transfer to an inpatient mental health facility, a residential care facility, or an outpatient competency restoration program;

    (C)  is confined in a correctional facility while awaiting further criminal proceedings following competency restoration; or
    
    (D)  is subject to Article [46B.072](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=46B.072), if the court has made the determinations required by Subsection (a-1) of that article;
    
    (3)  for whom a correctional facility or jail-based competency restoration program that employs or contracts with a licensed psychiatrist, an inpatient mental health facility, a residential care facility, or an outpatient competency restoration program provider has prepared a continuity of care plan that requires the defendant to take psychoactive medications; and
    
    (4)  who, after a hearing held under Section [574.106](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=574.106) or [592.156](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=592.156), Health and Safety Code, if applicable, has been found to not meet the criteria prescribed by Sections [574.106](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=574.106)(a) and (a-1) or [592.156](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=592.156)(a) and (b), Health and Safety Code, for court-ordered administration of psychoactive medications.
    
    (b)  If a defendant described by Subsection (a) refuses to take psychoactive medications as required by the defendant's continuity of care plan, the director of the facility or the program provider, as applicable, shall notify the court in which the criminal proceedings are pending of that fact not later than the end of the next business day following the refusal.  The court shall promptly notify the attorney representing the state and the attorney representing the defendant of the defendant's refusal.  The attorney representing the state may file a written motion to compel medication.  The motion to compel medication must be filed not later than the 15th day after the date a judge issues an order stating that the defendant does not meet the criteria for court-ordered administration of psychoactive medications under Section [574.106](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=574.106) or [592.156](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=592.156), Health and Safety Code, except that, for a defendant in an outpatient competency restoration program, the motion may be filed at any time.
    
    (c)  The court, after notice and after a hearing held not later than the 10th day after the motion to compel medication is filed, may authorize the director of the facility or the program provider, as applicable, to have the medication administered to the defendant, by reasonable force if necessary.  A hearing under this subsection may be conducted using an electronic broadcast system as provided by Article [46B.013](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=46B.013).
    
    (d)  The court may issue an order under this article only if the order is supported by the testimony of two physicians, one of whom is the physician at or with the applicable facility or program who is prescribing the medication as a component of the defendant's continuity of care plan and another who is not otherwise involved in proceedings against the defendant.  The court may require either or both physicians to examine the defendant and report on the examination to the court.
    
    (e)  The court may issue an order under this article if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that:
    
    (1)  the prescribed medication is medically appropriate, is in the best medical interest of the defendant, and does not present side effects that cause harm to the defendant that is greater than the medical benefit to the defendant;
    
    (2)  the state has a clear and compelling interest in the defendant obtaining and maintaining competency to stand trial;
    
    (3)  no other less invasive means of obtaining and maintaining the defendant's competency exists; and
    
    (4)  the prescribed medication will not unduly prejudice the defendant's rights or use of defensive theories at trial.
    
    (f)  A statement made by a defendant to a physician during an examination under Subsection (d) may not be admitted against the defendant in any criminal proceeding, other than at:
    
    (1)  a hearing on the defendant's incompetency; or
    
    (2)  any proceeding at which the defendant first introduces into evidence the contents of the statement.
    
    (g)  For a defendant described by Subsection (a)(2)(A), an order issued under this article:
    
    (1)  authorizes the initiation of any appropriate mental health treatment for the defendant awaiting transfer; and

    (l)  This article does not affect the responsibility of a county to ensure the safety of a defendant who is committed to the program and to provide the same adequate care to the defendant as is provided to other inmates of the jail in which the defendant is located.
    
    (m)  The court retains authority to order the transfer of a defendant who is subject to an order for jail-based competency restoration services to an outpatient competency restoration program if:
    
    (1)  the court determines that the defendant is not a danger to others and may be safely treated on an outpatient basis with the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial; and
    
    (2)  the other requirements of this subchapter relating to an order for outpatient competency restoration services are met.

A court is not required to hold a hearing under this subsection unless the request and any supporting materials provided to the court provide a basis for believing modification of the order may be appropriate.
    
    (e)  On receipt of a request to modify an order under Subsection (b), the court shall require the local mental health authority or local behavioral health authority to submit to the court, before any hearing is held under this article, a statement regarding whether treatment and supervision for the defendant can be safely and effectively provided on an outpatient basis and whether appropriate outpatient mental health services are available to the defendant.

    (h)  Proceedings for commitment of the defendant to a court-ordered outpatient treatment program are governed by Subtitle C, Title 7, Health and Safety Code, to the extent that Subtitle C applies and does not conflict with this chapter, except that the criminal court shall conduct the proceedings regardless of whether the criminal court is also the county court.
    
    (i)  The court shall rule on a request made under Subsection (b) as soon as practicable after a hearing on the request, but not later than the 14th day after the date of the request.
