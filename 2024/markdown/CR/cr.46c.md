    Art. 46C.261.  RENEWAL OF ORDERS FOR INPATIENT COMMITMENT OR OUTPATIENT OR COMMUNITY-BASED TREATMENT AND SUPERVISION.  (a)  A court that orders an acquitted person committed to inpatient treatment or orders outpatient or community-based treatment and supervision annually shall determine whether to renew the order.
    
    (b)  Not later than the 30th day before the date an order is scheduled to expire, the institution to which a person is committed, the person responsible for providing outpatient or community-based treatment and supervision, or the attorney representing the state may file a request that the order be renewed.  The request must explain in detail the reasons why the person requests renewal under this article.  A request to renew an order committing the person to inpatient treatment must also explain in detail why outpatient or community-based treatment and supervision is not appropriate.
    
    (c)  The request for renewal must be accompanied by a certificate of medical examination for mental illness signed by a physician who examined the person during the 30-day period preceding the date on which the request is filed.
    
    (d)  On the filing of a request for renewal under this article, the court shall:
    
    (1)  set the matter for a hearing; and
    
    (2)  appoint an attorney to represent the person.
    
    (e)  The court shall act on the request for renewal before the order expires.
    
    (f)  If a hearing is held, the person may be transferred from the facility to which the acquitted person was committed to a jail for purposes of participating in the hearing only if necessary but not earlier than 72 hours before the hearing begins.  If the order is renewed, the person shall be transferred back to the facility immediately on renewal of the order.
    
    (g)  If no objection is made, the court may admit into evidence the certificate of medical examination for mental illness.  Admitted certificates constitute competent medical or psychiatric testimony, and the court may make its findings solely from the certificate and the detailed request for renewal.
    
    (h)  A court shall renew the order only if the court finds that the party who requested the renewal has established by clear and convincing evidence that continued mandatory supervision and treatment are appropriate.  A renewed order authorizes continued inpatient commitment or outpatient or community-based treatment and supervision for not more than one year.
    
    (i)  The court, on application for renewal of an order for inpatient or residential care services, may modify the order to provide for outpatient or community-based treatment and supervision if the court finds the acquitted person has established by a preponderance of the evidence that treatment and supervision can be safely and effectively provided as outpatient or community-based treatment and supervision.

    (c)  If a request is made by an acquitted person or the attorney representing the state, the court must act on the request not later than the 14th day after the date of the request.  A hearing under this subsection is at the discretion of the court, except that the court shall hold a hearing if the request and any accompanying material provide a basis for believing modification of the order may be appropriate.
    
    (d)  If a request is made by an acquitted person not later than the 90th day after the date of a hearing on a previous request, the court is not required to act on the request except on the expiration of the order or on the expiration of the 90-day period following the date of the hearing on the previous request.
    
    (e)  The court shall rule on the request during or as soon as practicable after any hearing on the request but not later than the 14th day after the date of the request.
    
    (f)  The court shall modify the commitment order to direct outpatient or community-based treatment and supervision if at the hearing the acquitted person establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that treatment and supervision can be safely and effectively provided as outpatient or community-based treatment and supervision.

    (3)  after a period of inpatient treatment or residential care under Article [46C.262](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=46C.262).

    (c)  The order may require the person to participate in a prescribed regimen of medical, psychiatric, or psychological care or treatment, and the regimen may include treatment with psychoactive medication.
    
    (d)  The court may order that supervision of the acquitted person be provided by the appropriate community supervision and corrections department or the facility administrator of a community center that provides mental health or intellectual disability services.
    
    (e)  The court may order the acquitted person to participate in a supervision program funded by the Texas Correctional Office on Offenders with Medical or Mental Impairments.

    (g)  In determining whether an acquitted person should be ordered to receive outpatient or community-based treatment and supervision rather than inpatient care or residential treatment, the court shall have as its primary concern the protection of society.
