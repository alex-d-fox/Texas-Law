    CHAPTER 44. APPEAL AND WRIT OF ERROR
    
      
    
    
    Art. 44.01. APPEAL BY STATE.  (a)  The state is entitled to appeal an order of a court in a criminal case if the order:
    
    (1) dismisses an indictment, information, or complaint or any portion of an indictment, information, or complaint;
    
    (2) arrests or modifies a judgment;
    
    (3) grants a new trial;
    
    (4) sustains a claim of former jeopardy;
    
    (5) grants a motion to suppress evidence, a confession, or an admission, if jeopardy has not attached in the case and if the prosecuting attorney certifies to the trial court that the appeal is not taken for the purpose of delay and that the evidence, confession, or admission is of substantial importance in the case;  or
    
    (6) is issued under Chapter [64](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=64).
    
    (b) The state is entitled to appeal a sentence in a case on the ground that the sentence is illegal.
    
    (c) The state is entitled to appeal a ruling on a question of law if the defendant is convicted in the case and appeals the judgment.
    
    (d)  The prosecuting attorney may not make an appeal under Subsection (a) or (b) of this article later than the 20th day after the date on which the order, ruling, or sentence to be appealed is entered by the court.
    
    (e) The state is entitled to a stay in the proceedings pending the disposition of an appeal under Subsection (a) or (b) of this article.
    
    (f) The court of appeals shall give precedence in its docket to an appeal filed under Subsection (a) or (b) of this article.  The state shall pay all costs of appeal under Subsection (a) or (b) of this article, other than the cost of attorney's fees for the defendant.
    
    (g) If the state appeals pursuant to this article and the defendant is on bail, he shall be permitted to remain at large on the existing bail.  If the defendant is in custody, he is entitled to reasonable bail, as provided by law, unless the appeal is from an order which would terminate the prosecution, in which event the defendant is entitled to release on personal bond.
    
    (h) The Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure apply to a petition by the state to the Court of Criminal Appeals for review of a decision of a court of appeals in a criminal case.

The defendant's right to appeal under Article [44.02](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=44.02) may be prosecuted by the defendant where the punishment assessed is in accordance with Subchapter [C](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=42A.101), Chapter [42A](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=42A), as well as any other punishment assessed in compliance with Article [44.02](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=44.02).

    Art. 44.02. DEFENDANT MAY APPEAL.  A defendant in any criminal action has the right of appeal under the rules hereinafter prescribed, provided, however, before the defendant who has been convicted upon either his plea of guilty or plea of nolo contendere before the court and the court, upon the election of the defendant, assesses punishment and the punishment does not exceed the punishment recommended by the prosecutor and agreed to by the defendant and his attorney may prosecute his appeal, he must have permission of the trial court, except on those matters which have been raised by written motion filed prior to trial.  This article in no way affects appeals pursuant to Article [44.17](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=44.17) of this chapter.

    Art. 44.04. BOND PENDING APPEAL.  (a)  Pending the determination of any motion for new trial or the appeal from any misdemeanor conviction, the defendant is entitled to be released on reasonable bail.
    
    (b)  The defendant may not be released on bail pending the appeal from any felony conviction where the punishment equals or exceeds 10 years confinement or where the defendant has been convicted of an offense listed under Article [42A.054](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&Value=42A.054)(a), but shall immediately be placed in custody and the bail discharged.
    
    (c) Pending the appeal from any felony conviction other than a conviction described in Subsection (b) of this section, the trial court may deny bail and commit the defendant to custody if there then exists good cause to believe that the defendant would not appear when his conviction became final or is likely to commit another offense while on bail, permit the defendant to remain at large on the existing bail, or, if not then on bail, admit him to reasonable bail until his conviction becomes final.  The court may impose reasonable conditions on bail pending the finality of his conviction.  On a finding by the court on a preponderance of the evidence of a violation of a condition, the court may revoke the bail.
    
    (d) After conviction, either pending determination of any motion for new trial or pending final determination of the appeal, the court in which trial was had may increase or decrease the amount of bail, as it deems proper, either upon its own motion or the motion of the State or of the defendant.
    
    (e) Any bail entered into after conviction and the sureties on the bail must be approved by the court where trial was had.  Bail is sufficient if it substantially meets the requirements of this code and may be entered into and given at any term of court.
    
    (f) In no event shall the defendant and the sureties on his bond be released from their liability on such bond or bonds until the defendant is placed in the custody of the sheriff.
    
    (g) The right of appeal to the Court of Appeals of this state is expressly accorded the defendant for a review of any judgment or order made hereunder, and said appeal shall be given preference by the appellate court.
    
    (h) If a conviction is reversed by a decision of a Court of Appeals, the defendant, if in custody, is entitled to release on reasonable bail, regardless of the length of term of imprisonment, pending final determination of an appeal by the state or the defendant on a motion for discretionary review.  If the defendant requests bail before a petition for discretionary review has been filed, the Court of Appeals shall determine the amount of bail.  If the defendant requests bail after a petition for discretionary review has been filed, the Court of Criminal Appeals shall determine the amount of bail.  The sureties on the bail must be approved by the court where the trial was had.  The defendant's right to release under this subsection attaches immediately on the issuance of the Court of Appeals' final ruling as defined by Tex.Cr.App.R. 209(c).
    
    (i)  Notwithstanding any other law, pending the determination of a defendant's motion for new trial or the defendant's appeal from a misdemeanor conviction, the defendant is entitled to be released after completion of a sentence of confinement imposed for the conviction. The trial court may require the defendant to give a personal bond but may not, either instead of or in addition to the personal bond, require:
    
    (1)  any condition of the personal bond;
    
    (2)  another type of bail bond; or
    
    (3)  a surety or other security.
