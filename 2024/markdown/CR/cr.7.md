    CHAPTER 7. PROCEEDINGS BEFORE MAGISTRATES TO PREVENT OFFENSES
    
      
    
    
    Art. 7.01. SHALL ISSUE WARRANT.  Whenever a magistrate is informed upon oath that an offense is about to be committed against the person or property of the informant, or of another, or that any person has threatened to commit an offense, the magistrate shall immediately issue a warrant for the arrest of the accused;  that he may be brought before such magistrate or before some other named in the warrant.

    Art. 7.02. APPEARANCE BOND PENDING PEACE BOND HEARING.  In proceedings under this Chapter, the accused shall have the right to make an appearance bond;  such bond shall be conditioned as appearance bonds in other cases, and shall be further conditioned that the accused, pending the hearing, will not commit such offense and that he will keep the peace toward the person threatened or about to be injured, and toward all others, pending the hearing.  Should the accused enter into such appearance bond, such fact shall not constitute any evidence of the accusation brought against him at the hearing on the merits before the magistrate.

    Art. 7.03. ACCUSED BROUGHT BEFORE MAGISTRATE.  When the accused has been brought before the magistrate, he shall hear proof as to the accusation, and if he be satisfied that there is just reason to apprehend that the offense was intended to be committed, or that the threat was seriously made, he shall make an order that the accused enter into bond in such sum as he may in his discretion require, conditioned that he will not commit such offense, and that he will keep the peace toward the person threatened or about to be injured, and toward all others named in the bond for any period of time, not to exceed one year from the date of the bond.  The magistrate shall admonish the accused that if the accused violates a condition of the bond, the court, in addition to ordering forfeiture of the bond, may punish the accused for contempt under Section [21.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=21.002)(c), Government Code.
