    (1)  must categorize direct services program cases based on the types of services provided and, for each category, include provisions addressing:

    (B)  the recommended total expenditures for a case in that category;
    
    (2)  must include provisions for creating intermediate goals for a client receiving services through a direct services program that will allow:
    
    (A)  the caseworker to monitor the client's progress; and
    
    (B)  the caseworker's supervisor to evaluate how the client's case is advancing;
    
    (3)  must include criteria for caseworkers to use in evaluating progress on the intermediate goals described in Subdivision (2); and
    
    (4)  may include other provisions designed to assist caseworkers and their supervisors to achieve successful outcomes for clients.
    
    (b)  A caseworker may exceed the recommended guidelines described in Subsection (a)(1) in a direct services program case but must obtain the approval of the caseworker's supervisor after documenting the need to exceed the guidelines.
    
    (c)  The guidelines established under this section are not intended to limit the provision of appropriate or necessary services to a client.
    
    (d)  The department shall provide the guidelines established under this section to caseworkers in a format that allows caseworkers to easily access the information.

    (b)  The case review system must:
    
    (1)  include risk assessment tools that account for the different risks involved in each direct services program;
    
    (2)  require that case reviews:
    
    (A)  be used to consistently evaluate each direct services program across all regions, with the goal of evaluating at least 10 percent of all cases in each program and region annually;
    
    (B)  focus on areas of highest risk and prioritize the review of the following cases:
    
    (i)  except as provided by Subparagraph (ii), cases in which direct services have been provided for more than two years;
    
    (ii)  cases in the Blind Children's Vocational Discovery and Development Program in which direct services have been provided for more than five years; and
    
    (iii)  cases that are significantly outside the expenditure guidelines for that type of case;
    
    (C)  be used to evaluate a caseworker's eligibility determinations and decisions to close a case before a service plan is developed or without the client reaching the client's goal; and
    
    (D)  focus on the quality of a caseworker's decision-making and compliance with program requirements; and
    
    (3)  require a caseworker's supervisor to use the reviews of a caseworker's cases in conducting the caseworker's performance evaluation and in providing informal guidance to the caseworker to improve the caseworker's performance.
