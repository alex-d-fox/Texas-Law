    Sec. 42.001.  PURPOSE.  The purpose of this chapter is to protect the health, safety, and well-being of the children of the state who reside in child-care facilities by establishing statewide minimum standards for their safety and protection and by regulating the facilities through a licensing program.  It is the policy of the state to ensure the protection of all children under care in child-care facilities and to encourage and assist in the improvement of child-care programs.  It is also the intent of the legislature that freedom of religion of all citizens is inviolate.  With respect to a school or child-care facility sponsored by a religious organization, nothing in this chapter gives a governmental agency authority to regulate, control, supervise, or in any way be involved in the:
    
    (1)  form, manner, or content of religious instruction, ministry, teaching, or the curriculum offered by the school or facility;
    
    (2)  ability of the school or facility to select and supervise qualified personnel, and otherwise control the terms of employment, including the right to employ individuals who share the religious views of the school or facility;
    
    (3)  internal self-governance and autonomy of the school or facility; or
    
    (4)  religious environment of the school or facility, such as symbols, art, icons, and scripture.

    (e-5)  If the commission determines that the economic impact of requiring a day-care center or registered family home to comply with a minimum standard adopted under Subsection (e-3) is sufficiently great to make compliance impractical, the commission may require the day-care center or registered family home to meet the guidelines of the minimum standard through an alternative method.
    
    (f)  In promulgating minimum standards for the provision of child-care services, the executive commissioner shall recognize the various categories of services, including services for specialized care, the various categories of children and their particular needs, and the differences in the organization and operation of child-care facilities and general residential operations.

In adopting the minimum standards under this subsection, the executive commissioner shall consider:
    
    (1)  the special circumstances, needs, and precautions required of victims of trafficking of persons;
    
    (2)  the role of the general residential operations in assisting, supporting, and protecting victims of trafficking of persons; and

    (D)  a representative of a nonprofit entity licensed under this chapter; and
    
    (2)  send a copy of the proposed standards to each licensee covered by the proposed standards at least 60 days before the standards take effect to provide the licensee an opportunity to review and to send written suggestions to the department.
    
    (j)  The department may waive compliance with a minimum standard in a specific instance if it determines that the economic impact of compliance is sufficiently great to make compliance impractical.

    (m)  In determining minimum standards relating to staff-to-child ratios, group sizes, or square footage requirements applicable to nonresidential child-care facilities that provide care for less than 24 hours a day, the department shall, within available appropriations, conduct a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis and economic impact study that includes families and licensed child-care providers.
    
    (n)  Not later than the 60th day before the date the executive commissioner adopts a revision to the minimum standards for child-care facilities, the executive commissioner shall present the revision to the appropriate legislative oversight committees that have jurisdiction over child-care facilities for review and comment.
    
    (p)  The executive commissioner by rule shall prescribe minimum training standards for an employee of a regulated child-care facility, including the time required for completing the training.  The executive commissioner may not require an employee to repeat required training if the employee has completed the training within the time prescribed by department rule.  The department's local offices shall make available at the local office locations a copy of the rules regarding minimum training standards, information enabling the owner or operator of a regulated facility to apply for training funds from other agencies to lower facility costs, and any other materials the department may develop to assist the owner or operator or other entity in providing the training.
    
    (q)  Each residential child-care facility shall notify the department and the appropriate local law enforcement agency immediately on determining that a child is missing from the facility.

    (t)  The commission by rule shall grant to each child-placing agency and each single source continuum contractor the authority to waive certain minimum standards related to preservice training, annual training, or other requirements that are not directly related to caring for the child for:
    
    (1)  the child's foster or prospective adoptive parent; or
    
    (2)  foster homes that have no citations or violations reported to the commission.

During the probation period, the facility or family home must correct the items that were in noncompliance and report the corrections to the commission for approval.

(a)  The commission may suspend, deny, revoke, or refuse to renew the license, listing, registration, or certification of approval of a facility or family home that does not comply with the requirements of this chapter, commission standards and rules, or the specific terms of the license, listing, registration, or certification.  The commission may revoke the probation of a person whose license, listing, or registration is suspended if the person violates a term of the conditions of probation.
    
    (b)  If the commission proposes to take an action under Subsection (a), the person is entitled to a hearing conducted by the State Office of Administrative Hearings.  Proceedings for a disciplinary action are governed by the administrative procedure law, Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code.  An action under this section, including a revocation of a person's license, is a contested case as defined by Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code, and is subject to judicial review under the substantial evidence rule in accordance with that chapter.  Rules of practice adopted by the executive commissioner under Section [2001.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001.004), Government Code, applicable to the proceedings for a disciplinary action may not conflict with rules adopted by the State Office of Administrative Hearings.
    
    (c)  The commission may not issue a license, listing, registration, or certification to a person whose license, listing, registration, or certification is revoked or not renewed, whose application for a license, listing, registration, or certification is denied for a substantive reason under this chapter, or who in lieu of disciplinary action voluntarily closed a facility or family home or relinquished the person's license, listing, registration, or certification before the fifth anniversary of the date on which:
    
    (1)  the revocation or nonrenewal takes effect by commission or court order;
    
    (2)  the decision to deny the application is final;
    
    (3)  the facility or family home is closed; or
    
    (4)  the license, listing, registration, or certification is relinquished.
    
    (c-1)  A person described by Subsection (c) may not be a controlling person in any facility or family home during the five-year period in which the person is ineligible to receive a license, listing, registration, or certification.
    
    (d)  The executive commissioner by rule may provide for denial of an application or renewal for a licensed facility or for listing or registering a family home or may revoke a facility's license or a family home's listing or registration based on findings of background or criminal history as a result of a background or criminal history check.
    
    (d-1)  A person may not operate a facility or family home during an appeal of a suspension or denial of a license, certification, registration, or listing.
    
    (e)  A person may continue to operate a facility or family home during an appeal of a revocation or refusal to renew a license, certification, or registration unless the operation of the facility or family home poses a risk to the health or safety of children.  The executive commissioner shall by rule establish the criteria for determining whether the operation of a facility or family home poses a risk to the health or safety of children.  The commission shall notify the facility or family home of the criteria the commission used to determine that the operation of the facility or family home poses a risk to health or safety and that the facility or family home may not operate.  A person who has been notified by the commission that the facility or home may not operate under this section may seek injunctive relief from a district court in Travis County or in the county in which the facility or home is located to allow operation during the pendency of an appeal.  The court may grant injunctive relief against the commission's action only if the court finds that the child-care operation does not pose a health or safety risk to children.  A court granting injunctive relief under this subsection shall have no other jurisdiction over an appeal of final commission action unless conferred by Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code.
    
    (f)  The commission shall deny an application or renewal for listing or registering a family home or shall revoke a family home's listing or registration if the results of a background or criminal history check conducted by the commission under Section [42.056](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HR&Value=42.056) show that a person has been convicted of an offense under Title 5 or 6, Penal Code, or Chapter [43](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=43), Penal Code.
    
    (g)  Notwithstanding Subsection (c), the commission may refuse to issue a license, listing, registration, or certification to:
    
    (1)  a person whose license, listing, registration, or certification for a facility or family home was revoked by the commission or by court order;
    
    (2)  a person who was a controlling person of a facility or family home at the time conduct occurred that resulted in the revocation of the license, listing, registration, or certification of the facility or family home;
    
    (3)  a person who voluntarily closed a facility or family home or relinquished the person's license, listing, registration, or certification after:
    
    (A)  the commission took an action under Subsection (a) in relation to the facility, family home, or person; or
    
    (B)  the person received notice that the commission intended to take an action under Subsection (a) in relation to the facility, family home, or person; or

    Sec. 42.078.  ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY.  (a)  The commission may impose an administrative sanction or an administrative penalty against a facility or family home licensed, registered, or listed under this chapter that violates this chapter or a rule or order adopted under this chapter.  In addition, the commission may impose an administrative penalty against a facility or family home or a controlling person of a facility or family home if the facility, family home, or controlling person:
    
    (1)  violates a term of a license or registration issued under this chapter;
    
    (2)  makes a statement about a material fact that the facility or person knows or should know is false:
    
    (A)  on an application for the issuance of a license or registration or an attachment to the application; or

    (a-1)  Except as provided by Subsection (a-2), nonmonetary administrative sanctions, including corrective action plans and probation periods, shall be imposed when appropriate before administrative penalties.
    
    (a-2)  The commission may impose an administrative penalty without first imposing a nonmonetary administrative sanction for violating a minimum standard applicable to a facility or family home under this chapter that is determined by the commission to be a high-risk standard, including standards for a violation constituting abuse, neglect, or exploitation of a child, background check standards, safety hazard standards, standards establishing times for reporting information to a parent or guardian or the commission, and supervision standards.
    
    (b)  Each day a violation continues or occurs is a separate violation for purposes of imposing a penalty.  The penalty for a violation may be in an amount not to exceed the following limits, based on the maximum number of children for whom the facility or family home was authorized to provide care or the number of children under the care of the child-placing agency when the violation occurred:
    
    (1)  for violations that occur in a facility other than a residential child-care facility:

    81-100    | $100  
      More than 100|  $150  
      
    (2)  for violations that occur in a residential child-care facility:
    
    |   
    ---|---  
    Number of children| Maximum amount of penalty  
    20 or less| $100  
    21-40    | $150  
    41-60    | $200  
    61-80    | $250  
    81-100    | $375  
      More than 100|    $500    
      
    (c)  In addition to the number of children, the amount of the penalty shall be based on:
    
    (1)  the seriousness of the violation, including the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of any prohibited acts, and the hazard or potential hazard created to the health, safety, or economic welfare of the public;
    
    (2)  the economic harm to property or the environment caused by the violation;
    
    (3)  the history of previous violations;
    
    (4)  the amount necessary to deter future violations;
    
    (5)  efforts to correct the violation; and
    
    (6)  any other matter that justice may require.
    
    (d)  Monetary penalties may not be assessed for violations that are the result of clerical errors.
    
    (e)  If the commission determines that a violation has occurred, the commission  may issue a recommendation on the imposition of a penalty, including a recommendation on the amount of the penalty.
    
    (e-1)  Notwithstanding the amounts required by Subsections (b) and (c) and except as provided by Subsection (e-3), the commission shall recommend the penalty for the following violations by a facility or family home to be assessed in the following amounts:
    
    (1)  $1,000 for a violation that constitutes abuse, neglect, or exploitation of a child;
    
    (2)  $500 for failure to report to a parent or guardian of a child or the commission within the time required by commission standards an injury of a child in the care of the facility or home that requires treatment by a medical professional or hospitalization or an illness of a child that requires hospitalization;
    
    (3)  $50 for failure to report to a parent or guardian of each child in the care of the facility or home within the time required by commission standards that the commission cited the facility or home for a violation:
    
    (A)  that constitutes abuse, neglect, or exploitation of a child; or
    
    (B)  of a safe sleeping standard; and
    
    (4)  $50 for failure to report to a parent or guardian of each child in the care of the facility or home within the time required by commission standards that the facility or home does not maintain liability insurance coverage.
    
    (e-2)  For purposes of Subsections (e-1)(3) and (4), the commission shall recommend a penalty of $50 for the initial violation and an additional penalty of $50 for each day the violation continues or occurs.
    
    (e-3)  Subsection (e-1)(1) does not apply to a residential child-care facility.
    
    (f)  Within 14 days after the date the recommendation is issued, the commission shall give written notice of the recommendation to the person owning or operating the facility or family home or to the controlling person, if applicable.  The notice may be given by certified mail.  The notice must include a brief summary of the alleged violation and a statement of the amount of the recommended penalty and must inform the person that the person has a right to a hearing on the occurrence of the violation, the amount of the penalty, or both the occurrence of the violation and the amount of the penalty.
    
    (g)  Within 20 days after the date the person receives the notice, the person in writing may accept the determination and recommended penalty of the commission or may make a written request for a hearing on the occurrence of the violation, the amount of the penalty, or both the occurrence of the violation and the amount of the penalty.
    
    (h)  If the person accepts the determination and recommended penalty of the commission or fails to respond to the notice in a timely manner, the commission shall issue an order and impose the recommended penalty.
    
    (i)  If the person requests a hearing, the commission shall set a hearing and give notice of the hearing to the person.  The hearing shall be held by an administrative law judge of the State Office of Administrative Hearings.  The administrative law judge shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law and issue a final decision finding that a violation has occurred and imposing a penalty or finding that no violation occurred.
    
    (j)  The notice of the administrative law judge's order given to the person under Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code, must include a statement of the right of the person to judicial review of the order.
    
    (k)  Within 30 days after the date the administrative law judge's order becomes final as provided by Section [2001.144](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001.144), Government Code, the person shall:
    
    (1)  pay the amount of the penalty;
    
    (2)  pay the amount of the penalty and file a petition for judicial review contesting the occurrence of the violation, the amount of the penalty, or both the occurrence of the violation and the amount of the penalty;  or
    
    (3)  without paying the amount of the penalty, file a petition for judicial review contesting the occurrence of the violation, the amount of the penalty, or both the occurrence of the violation and the amount of the penalty.
    
    (l)  Within the 30-day period, a person who acts under Subsection (k)(3) may:
    
    (1)  stay enforcement of the penalty by:
    
    (A)  paying the amount of the penalty to the court for placement in an escrow account; or
    
    (B)  giving to the court a supersedeas bond that is approved by the court for the amount of the penalty and that is effective until all judicial review of the order is final; or
    
    (2)  request the court to stay enforcement of the penalty by:
    
    (A)  filing with the court a sworn affidavit of the person stating that the person is financially unable to pay the amount of the penalty and is financially unable to give the supersedeas bond; and
    
    (B)  giving a copy of the affidavit to the department by certified mail.
    
    (m)  On receipt of a copy of an affidavit under Subsection (l)(2), the commission may file with the court, within five days after the date the copy is received, a contest to the affidavit.  The court shall hold a hearing on the facts alleged in the affidavit as soon as practicable and shall stay the enforcement of the penalty on finding that the alleged facts are true.  The person who files an affidavit has the burden of proving that the person is financially unable to pay the amount of the penalty and to give a supersedeas bond.
    
    (n)  If the person does not pay the amount of the penalty and the enforcement of the penalty is not stayed, the commission may refer the matter to the attorney general for collection of the amount of the penalty.
    
    (o)  Judicial review of the order:
    
    (1)  is instituted by filing a petition as provided by Subchapter [G](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001.171), Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001),  Government Code;  and
    
    (2)  is under the substantial evidence rule.
    
    (p)  If the court sustains the occurrence of the violation, the court may uphold or reduce the amount of the penalty and order the person to pay the full or reduced amount of the penalty.  If the court does not sustain the occurrence of the violation, the court shall order that no penalty is owed.
    
    (q)  When the judgment of the court becomes final, the court shall proceed under this subsection.  If the person paid the amount of the penalty and if that amount is reduced or is not upheld by the court, the court shall order that the appropriate amount plus accrued interest be remitted to the person.  The rate of the interest is the rate charged on loans to depository institutions by the New York Federal Reserve Bank, and the interest shall be paid for the period beginning on the date the penalty was paid and ending on the date the penalty is remitted.  If the person gave a supersedeas bond and if the amount of the penalty is not upheld by the court, the court shall order the release of the bond.  If the person gave a supersedeas bond and if the amount of the penalty is reduced, the court shall order the release of the bond after the person pays the amount.
    
    (r)  A penalty collected under this section shall be sent to the comptroller for deposit in the safety training account established under Section [42.04215](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HR&Value=42.04215).
    
    (s)  All proceedings under this section are subject to Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code.
