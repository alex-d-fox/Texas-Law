    SUBCHAPTER B. ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 32.021.  ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAM.  (a)  The commission is the single state agency designated to administer the medical assistance program provided in this chapter in accordance with 42 U.S.C. Section 1396a(a)(5).  Subject to applicable federal law, the commission may delegate the operation of a part of the medical assistance program to another state agency.  Notwithstanding any delegation, the commission retains ultimate authority over the medical assistance program.
    
    (a-1)  To the extent the commission delegates the operation of a part of the medical assistance program to another state agency, or to the extent that state law assigns a function of the medical assistance program to another health and human services agency operating under the commission's oversight, a reference in this chapter to the commission with respect to that part of the medical assistance program means the state agency to which the operation of that part is delegated or assigned.
    
    (b)  The commission shall enter into agreements with any federal agency designated by federal law to administer medical assistance when the commission determines the agreements to be compatible with the state's participation in the medical assistance program and within the limits of appropriated funds.  The commission shall cooperate with federal agencies designated by federal law to administer medical assistance in any reasonable manner necessary to qualify for federal funds.
    
    (c)  The executive commissioner shall establish methods of administration and adopt necessary rules for the proper and efficient operation of the medical assistance program.
    
      
    
    
    Text of subsection effective until April 01, 2025
    
      
    
    
    (d)  The commission shall include in its contracts for the delivery of medical assistance by nursing facilities provisions for monetary penalties to be assessed for violations as required by 42 U.S.C. Section 1396r, including without limitation the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA), Pub. L. No. 100-203, Nursing Home Reform Amendments of 1987, provided that the executive commissioner shall:
    
    (1)  provide for an informal dispute resolution process in the commission as provided by Section [531.058](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=531.058), Government Code; and
    
    (2)  develop rules to adjudicate claims in contested cases, including claims unresolved by the informal dispute resolution process of the commission.
    
      
    
    
    Text of subsection effective on April 01, 2025
    
      
    
    
    (d)  The commission shall include in its contracts for the delivery of medical assistance by nursing facilities provisions for monetary penalties to be assessed for violations as required by 42 U.S.C. Section 1396r, including without limitation the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA), Pub. L. No. 100-203, Nursing Home Reform Amendments of 1987, provided that the executive commissioner shall:
    
    (1)  provide for an informal dispute resolution process in the commission as provided by Section [526.0202](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=526.0202), Government Code; and
    
    (2)  develop rules to adjudicate claims in contested cases, including claims unresolved by the informal dispute resolution process of the commission.
    
    (e)  Rules governing the application of penalties shall include the following:
    
    (1)  specific and objective criteria which describe the scope and severity of a contract violation which results in a recommendation for each specific penalty.  Penalties must be appropriate to the violation, and the most severe financial penalties must be reserved for situations which create an immediate and serious threat to the health and safety of residents;  "immediate and serious threat" means a situation in which there is a high probability that serious harm or injury to residents could occur at any time or already has occurred and may well occur again if residents are not protected effectively from the harm or if the threat is not removed;
    
    (2)  a system to ensure standard and consistent application of penalties among surveyors and different areas of the state;
    
    (3)  due process for nursing facilities providers, including an appeals procedure consistent with Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code; and
    
    (4)  per diem and/or minimum penalties.  The executive commissioner may by rule prescribe a minimum penalty period;  however, once a facility gives the Department of Aging and Disability Services notice that deficiencies have been corrected, if surveyors are unable to revisit the facility within five days and the deficiencies are later shown to be corrected, the per diem penalties cease as of the day the facility gave notice to the Department of Aging and Disability Services or on the last day of the minimum penalty period established by the executive commissioner, whichever is later.
    
    (f)  To encourage facilities to provide the best possible care, the commission shall develop an incentive program to recognize facilities providing the highest quality care to Medicaid residents.
    
    (g)  Funds collected as a result of the imposition of penalties shall be applied to the protection of the health or property of residents of nursing facilities, including the cost of relocation of residents to other facilities and maintenance or operation of a facility pending correction of deficiencies or closure, or to incentive programs which recognize the highest quality care to residents who are entitled to Medicaid.
    
    (h)  Medicaid nursing facilities shall also comply with state licensure rules, which may be more stringent than the requirements for certification.  The Department of Aging and Disability Services shall use appropriate civil, administrative, or criminal remedies authorized by state or federal law with respect to a facility that is in violation of a certification or licensing requirement.
    
    (i)  Repealed by Acts 2003, 78th Leg., ch. 204, Sec. 16.03(1).

    (m)  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the commission shall terminate a nursing facility's provider agreement if the Department of Aging and Disability Services has imposed required Category 2 or Category 3 remedies on the facility three times within a 24-month period.  The executive commissioner by rule shall establish criteria under which the requirement to terminate the provider agreement may be waived.  In this subsection, "Category 2 remedies" and "Category 3 remedies" have the meanings assigned by 42 C.F.R. Section 488.408.
    
    (n)  An assessment of monetary penalties under this section is subject to arbitration under Subchapter [H-2](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=242.251), Chapter [242](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=242), Health and Safety Code.
    
    (o)  In any circumstance in which a nursing facility would otherwise be required to admit a resident transferred from another facility, because of an emergency or otherwise, the nursing facility may not admit a resident whose needs cannot be met through service from the facility's staff or in cooperation with community resources or other providers under contract.  If a nursing facility refuses to admit a resident under this subsection, the nursing facility shall provide a written statement of the reasons for the refusal to the Department of Aging and Disability Services within a period specified by rule.  A nursing facility that fails to provide the written statement, or that includes false or misleading information in the statement, is subject to monetary penalties assessed in accordance with this chapter.
    
    (p)  In order to increase the personal needs allowance under Section [32.024](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HR&Value=32.024)(w), the commission shall develop an early warning system to detect fraud in the handling of the personal needs allowance and other funds of residents of long-term care facilities.
    
    (q)  The commission shall include in its contracts for the delivery of medical assistance by nursing facilities clearly defined minimum standards that relate directly to the quality of care for residents of those facilities.   The commission shall include in each contract:
    
    (1)  specific performance measures by which the commission may evaluate the extent to which the nursing facility is meeting the standards; and
    
    (2)  provisions that allow the commission to terminate the contract if the nursing facility is not meeting the standards.
    
    (r)  The commission may not award a contract for the delivery of medical assistance to a nursing facility that does not meet the minimum standards that would be included in the contract as required by Subsection (q).  The commission shall terminate a contract for the delivery of medical assistance by a nursing facility that does not meet or maintain the minimum standards included in the contract in a manner consistent with the terms of the contract.

    (b)  The executive commissioner shall adopt rules in accordance with 42 U.S.C. Section 1396a(e)(12), as amended, to provide for two consecutive periods of eligibility for a child between each certification and recertification of the child's eligibility, subject to Subsections (f) and (h).
    
    (c)  The first of the two consecutive periods of eligibility described by Subsection (b) must be continuous in accordance with Subsection (d).  The second of the two consecutive periods of eligibility is not continuous and may be affected by changes in a child's household income, regardless of whether those changes occurred or whether the commission became aware of the changes during the first or second of the two consecutive periods of eligibility.
    
    (d)  A child remains eligible for medical assistance during the first of the two consecutive periods of eligibility, without additional review by the commission and regardless of changes in the child's household income, until  the end of the six-month period following the date on which the child's eligibility was determined, except as provided by Subsections (f)(1) and (h).
    
    (e)  During the sixth month following the date on which a child's eligibility for medical assistance is certified or recertified, the commission shall, in a manner that complies with federal law, including verification plan requirements under 42 C.F.R. Section 435.945(j), review the child's household income using electronic income data available to the commission.  The commission may conduct this review only once during the child's two consecutive periods of eligibility.  Based on the review:
    
    (1)  the commission shall, if the review indicates that the child's household income does not exceed the maximum income for eligibility for the medical assistance program, provide for a second consecutive period of eligibility for the child until the child's required annual recertification, except as provided by Subsection (h) and subject to Subsection (c); or
    
    (2)  the commission may, if the review indicates that the child's household income exceeds the maximum income for eligibility for the medical assistance program, request additional documentation to verify the child's household income in a manner that complies with federal law.
    
    (f)  If, after reviewing a child's household income under Subsection (e), the commission determines that the household income exceeds the maximum income for eligibility for the medical assistance program, the commission shall continue to provide medical assistance to the child until:
    
    (1)  the commission provides the child's parent or guardian with a period of not less than 30 days to provide documentation demonstrating that the child's household income does not exceed the maximum income for eligibility; and
    
    (2)  the child's parent or guardian fails to provide the documentation during the period described by Subdivision (1).
    
    (g)  If a child's parent or guardian provides to the commission within the period described by Subsection (f) documentation demonstrating that the child's household income does not exceed the maximum income for eligibility for the medical assistance program, the commission shall provide for a second consecutive period of eligibility for the child until the child's required annual recertification, except as provided by Subsection (h) and subject to Subsection (c).
    
    (h)  Notwithstanding any other period prescribed by this section, a child's eligibility for medical assistance ends on the child's 19th birthday.
    
    (i)  The commission may not recertify a child's eligibility for medical assistance more frequently than every 12 months as required by federal law.
    
    (j)  If a child's parent or guardian fails to provide to the commission within the period described by Subsection (f) documentation demonstrating that the child's household income does not exceed the maximum income for eligibility for the medical assistance program, the commission shall provide the child's parent or guardian with written notice of termination following that period.  The notice must include a statement that the child may be eligible for enrollment in the child health plan under Chapter [62](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=62), Health and Safety Code.
    
    (k)  In developing the notice, the commission shall consult with health care providers, children's health care advocates, family members of children enrolled in the medical assistance program, and other stakeholders to determine the most user-friendly method to provide the notice to a child's parent or guardian.
    
    (l)  The executive commissioner may adopt rules as necessary to implement this section.

    (2)  the state to offset the costs of providing those services to that recipient under the medical assistance program.
    
    (c)  The proceeds of a life settlement contract entered into under this section must be used for the payment of long-term care services and support, except for the amount specified in Subsection (d)(1).  To the extent feasible and allowed under federal law, the medical assistance program may act only as the secondary payor for long-term care services and support provided to a person who is eligible for medical assistance and for whose benefit an owner of a life insurance policy has entered into a life settlement contract under this section.

    (f)  Only a recipient of long-term care services and support for whose benefit an owner enters into a life settlement contract under this section may choose the provider and type of services provided to the recipient and paid for out of an account described by Subsection (e).

    (i)  Section [1111A.022](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1111A.022)(a)(2)(A), Insurance Code, does not apply to a life insurance policy that is the subject of a life settlement contract entered into under this section if the contract has been in force at least five years.
    
    (j)  A claim against a life settlement contract provider with whom an owner of a life insurance policy enters into a life settlement contract under this section by the owner, the owner's estate, a named beneficiary, or any other person with respect to the contract may not exceed the face amount of the policy, less the proceeds paid under the contract, plus the total amount of premiums paid by the owner since entering into the contract.  A life settlement contract provider must pay a claim under this subsection from the funds in an account described by Subsection (e).
    
    (k)  In accordance with Chapter [1111A](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1111A), Insurance Code, the Texas Department of Insurance may conduct periodic market examinations of each life settlement contract provider who enters into a life settlement contract with an owner of a life insurance policy under this section.
    
    (l)  The commission shall educate applicants for long-term care services and support under the medical assistance program about options for life insurance policies, including options that do not allow a life insurance policy to be considered as an asset or resource in determining eligibility for medical assistance.
    
    (m)  The executive commissioner, in consultation with the commissioner of insurance, shall adopt rules necessary to implement this section. The rules must ensure that:
    
    (1)  proceeds from a life settlement contract are used to reimburse a provider of long-term care services and support or the state to offset the cost of medical assistance long-term care services and support;
    
    (2)  eligibility and need for medical assistance are determined without considering the balance of proceeds from a life settlement contract as provided in this section; and
    
    (3)  payments to a provider of long-term care services and support and applied income payments are made in accordance with this chapter.
    
    (n)  The entry into a life settlement contract by an owner of a life insurance policy under this section is not the only method by which the owner may avoid having the policy considered as an asset or resource in determining the eligibility of the owner for medical assistance.

    (d)  To the extent allowed by federal law, any differences in methodology or its implementation between state-operated facilities and private facilities must be stated explicitly in the rule, must be related to actual differences in the nature of the expenses incurred by the class of providers, including size categories, and must not favor state-operated facilities in setting payment rates.  When the proposed rule or amendments to the rule are published for public comment, the executive commissioner must certify that any differences in methodology between classes of providers, including size categories, are necessitated by cost structure and will not favor state-operated facilities in the setting of payment rates.

    (d)  Unless the provider submitted information to the commission for use in preparing a voucher that the provider knew or should have known was false or failed to correct information that the provider knew or should have known was false when provided an opportunity to do so, this section does not apply to a claim based on the voucher if the commission calculated and printed the amount of the claim on the voucher and then submitted the voucher to the provider for the provider's signature.  In addition, the provider's signature on the voucher does not constitute fraud.  The executive commissioner shall adopt rules that establish a grace period during which errors contained in a voucher prepared by the commission may be corrected without penalty to the provider.
    
    (e)  In determining the amount of the penalty to be assessed under Subsection (c)(2), the commission shall consider:
    
    (1)  the seriousness of the violation;
    
    (2)  whether the person had previously committed a violation; and
    
    (3)  the amount necessary to deter the person from committing future violations.
    
    (f)  If after an examination of the facts the commission concludes that the person committed a violation, the commission may issue a preliminary report stating the facts on which it based its conclusion, recommending that an administrative penalty under this section be imposed and recommending the amount of the proposed penalty.
    
    (g)  The commission shall give written notice of the report to the person charged with committing the violation. The notice must include a brief summary of the facts, a statement of the amount of the recommended penalty, and a statement of the person's right to an informal review of the alleged violation, the amount of the penalty, or both the alleged violation and the amount of the penalty.
    
    (h)  Not later than the 10th day after the date on which the person charged with committing the violation receives the notice, the person may either give the commission written consent to the report, including the recommended penalty, or make a written request for an informal review by the commission.
    
    (i)  If the person charged with committing the violation consents to the penalty recommended by the commission or fails to timely request an informal review, the commission shall assess the penalty.  The commission shall give the person written notice of its action.  The person shall pay the penalty not later than the 30th day after the date on which the person receives the notice.
    
    (j)  If the person charged with committing the violation requests an informal review as provided by Subsection (h), the commission shall conduct the review.  The commission shall give the person written notice of the results of the review.
    
    (k)  Not later than the 10th day after the date on which the person charged with committing the violation receives the notice prescribed by Subsection (j), the person may make to the commission a written request for a hearing.

    (l)  If, after informal review, a person who has been ordered to pay a penalty fails to request a formal hearing in a timely manner, the commission shall assess the penalty.  The commission shall give the person written notice of its action.  The person shall pay the penalty not later than the 30th day after the date on which the person receives the notice.
    
    (m)  Within 30 days after the date on which the commission's order issued after a hearing under Subsection (k) becomes final as provided by Section [2001.144](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001.144), Government Code, the person shall:
    
    (1)  pay the amount of the penalty;
    
    (2)  pay the amount of the penalty and file a petition for judicial review contesting the occurrence of the violation, the amount of the penalty, or both the occurrence of the violation and the amount of the penalty; or
    
    (3)  without paying the amount of the penalty, file a petition for judicial review contesting the occurrence of the violation, the amount of the penalty, or both the occurrence of the violation and the amount of the penalty.
    
    (n)  A person who acts under Subsection (m)(3) within the 30-day period may:
    
    (1)  stay enforcement of the penalty by:
    
    (A)  paying the amount of the penalty to the court for placement in an escrow account; or
    
    (B)  giving to the court a supersedeas bond that is approved by the court for the amount of the penalty and that is effective until all judicial review of the commission's order is final; or
    
    (2)  request the court to stay enforcement of the penalty by:
    
    (A)  filing with the court a sworn affidavit of the person stating that the person is financially unable to pay the amount of the penalty and is financially unable to give the supersedeas bond; and
    
    (B)  giving a copy of the affidavit to the executive commissioner by certified mail.
    
    (o)  If the executive commissioner receives a copy of an affidavit under Subsection (n)(2), the executive commissioner may file with the court, within five days after the date the copy is received, a contest to the affidavit.  The court shall hold a hearing on the facts alleged in the affidavit as soon as practicable and shall stay the enforcement of the penalty on finding that the alleged facts are true.  The person who files an affidavit has the burden of proving that the person is financially unable to pay the amount of the penalty and to give a supersedeas bond.
    
    (p)  If the person charged does not pay the amount of the penalty and the enforcement of the penalty is not stayed, the commission may forward the matter to the attorney general for enforcement of the penalty and interest as provided by law for legal judgments.  An action to enforce a penalty order under this section must be initiated in a court of competent jurisdiction in Travis County or in the county in which the violation was committed.
    
    (q)  Judicial review of a commission order or review under this section assessing a penalty is under the substantial evidence rule.  A suit may be initiated by filing a petition with a district court in Travis County, as provided by Subchapter [G](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001.171), Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code.
    
    (r)  If a penalty is reduced or not assessed, the commission shall remit to the person the appropriate amount plus accrued interest if the penalty has been paid or shall execute a release of the bond if a supersedeas bond has been posted.  The accrued interest on amounts remitted by the commission under this subsection shall be paid at a rate equal to the rate provided by law for legal judgments and shall be paid for the period beginning on the date the penalty is paid to the commission under this section and ending on the date the penalty is remitted.
    
    (s)  A damage, cost, or penalty collected under this section is not an allowable expense in a claim or cost report that is or could be used to determine a rate or payment under the medical assistance program.

The period of ineligibility begins on the date on which the determination that the person is liable becomes final.
    
    (v)  Except as provided by Subsection (w), a person found liable for a violation under Subsection (c) that did not result in injury to an elderly person, as defined by Section [48.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HR&Value=48.002)(a)(1), a person with a disability, as defined by Section [48.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HR&Value=48.002)(a)(8)(A), or a person younger than 18 years of age may not provide or arrange to provide health care services under the medical assistance program for a period of three years.

If the commission determines under Subsection (d) that enrolling the individual in the group health benefit plan is not cost-effective, but the individual prefers to enroll in that plan instead of receiving benefits and services under the medical assistance program, the commission, if authorized by a waiver obtained under federal law, shall:
    
    (1)  allow the individual to voluntarily opt out of receiving services through the medical assistance program and enroll in the group health benefit plan;
    
    (2)  consider that individual to be a recipient of medical assistance; and
    
    (3)  provide written notice to the issuer of the group health benefit plan in accordance with Chapter [1207](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1207), Insurance Code.
    
    (f)  Except as provided by Subsection (f-1), the commission shall provide for payment of:
    
    (1)  the employee's share of required premiums for coverage of an individual enrolled in the group health benefit plan; and
    
    (2)  any deductible, copayment, coinsurance, or other cost-sharing obligation imposed on the enrolled individual for an item or service otherwise covered under the medical assistance program.
    
    (f-1)  For an individual described by Subsection (e-1) who enrolls in a group health benefit plan, the commission shall provide for payment of the employee's share of the required premiums, except that if the employee's share of the required premiums exceeds the total estimated Medicaid costs for the individual, as determined by the executive commissioner, the individual shall pay the difference between the required premiums and those estimated costs.  The individual shall also pay all deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, and other cost-sharing obligations imposed on the individual under the group health benefit plan.
    
    (g)  A payment made by the commission under Subsection (f) or (f-1) is considered to be a payment for medical assistance.
    
    (h)  A payment of a premium for an individual who is a member of the family of an individual enrolled in a group health benefit plan under Subsection (e) and who is not eligible for medical assistance is considered to be a payment for medical assistance for an eligible individual if:
    
    (1)  enrollment of the family members who are eligible for medical assistance is not possible under the plan without also enrolling members who are not eligible; and
    
    (2)  the commission determines it to be cost-effective.
    
    (i)  A payment of any deductible, copayment, coinsurance, or other cost-sharing obligation of a family member who is enrolled in a group health benefit plan in accordance with Subsection (h) and who is not eligible for medical assistance:
    
    (1)  may not be paid under this chapter; and
    
    (2)  is not considered to be a payment for medical assistance for an eligible individual.
    
    (i-1)  The commission shall make every effort to expedite payments made under this section, including by ensuring that those payments are made through electronic transfers of money to the recipient's account at a financial institution, if possible.  In lieu of reimbursing the individual enrolled in the group health benefit plan for required premium or cost-sharing payments made by the individual, the commission may, if feasible:
    
    (1)  make payments under this section for required premiums directly to the employer providing the group health benefit plan in which an individual is enrolled; or
    
    (2)  make payments under this section for required premiums and cost-sharing obligations directly to the group health benefit plan issuer.
    
    (j)  The commission shall treat coverage under the group health benefit plan as a third party liability to the program.  Subject to Subsection (j-1), enrollment of an individual in a group health benefit plan under this section does not affect the individual's eligibility for medical assistance benefits, except that the state is entitled to payment under Sections [32.033](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HR&Value=32.033) and [32.038](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HR&Value=32.038).
    
    (j-1)  An individual described by Subsection (e-1) who enrolls in a group health benefit plan is not ineligible for home and community-based services provided under a Section 1915(c) waiver program or another federal home and community-based services waiver program solely based on the individual's enrollment in the group health benefit plan, and the individual may receive those services if the individual is otherwise eligible for the program.  The individual is otherwise limited to the health benefits coverage provided under the health benefit plan in which the individual is enrolled, and the individual may not receive any benefits or services under the medical assistance program other than the premium payment as provided by Subsection (f-1) and, if applicable, waiver program services described by this subsection.

    (n)  The commission shall develop procedures by which an individual described by Subsection (e-1) who enrolls in a group health benefit plan may, at the individual's option, resume receiving benefits and services under the medical assistance program instead of the group health benefit plan.
    
    (o)  The commission shall develop procedures which ensure that, prior to allowing an individual described by Subsection (e-1) to enroll in a group health benefit plan or allowing the parent or caretaker of an individual described by Subsection (e-1) under the age of 21 to enroll that child in a group health benefit plan:
    
    (1)  the individual must receive counseling informing them that for the period in which the individual is enrolled in the group health benefit plan:
    
    (A)  the individual shall be limited to the health benefits coverage provided under the health benefit plan in which the individual is enrolled;
    
    (B)  the individual may not receive any benefits or services under the medical assistance program other than the premium payment as provided by Subsection (f-1);
    
    (C)  the individual shall pay the difference between the required premiums and the premium payment as provided by Subsection (f-1) and shall also pay all deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, and other cost-sharing obligations imposed on the individual under the group health benefit plan; and
    
    (D)  the individual may, at the individual's option through procedures developed by the commission, resume receiving benefits and services under the medical assistance program instead of the group health benefit plan; and
    
    (2)  the individual must sign and the commission shall retain a copy of a waiver indicating the individual has provided informed consent.

    (4)  replace the 15-point system used for determining the dental necessity for hospitalization and general anesthesia with a more objective and comprehensive system developed by the commission; and
    
    (5)  take all necessary action to eliminate unlawful acts described by Section [36.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HR&Value=36.002) in the provision of dental services under the medical assistance program, including:

    (d)  In setting reimbursement rates for dental services under the medical assistance program, the executive commissioner shall:
    
    (1)   provide for reimbursement of a behavior management fee only if:
    
    (A)  the patient receiving dental treatment has been previously diagnosed with an intellectual or developmental disability or a mental disability or disorder, and extraordinary behavior management techniques are necessary for therapeutic dental treatment because of the patient's uncooperative behavior; and
    
    (B)  the dentist includes in the patient's records and on the claim form for reimbursement a narrative description of:
    
    (i)  the specific behavior problem demonstrated by the patient that required the use of behavior management techniques;
    
    (ii)  the dentist's initial efforts to manage the patient's behavior through routine behavior management techniques; and
    
    (iii)  the dentist's extraordinary behavior management techniques subsequently required to manage the patient's behavior; and
    
    (2)  redistribute amounts made available through limitation of the behavior management fee under Subdivision (1) to other commonly billed dental services for which adequate accountability measures exist.
    
    (e)  The commission shall develop the minimum standard described by Subsection (c)(3) in cooperation with the State Board of Dental Examiners.
    
    (f)  To prevent serious medical conditions and reduce emergency room visits necessitated by complications resulting from a lack of access to dental care, the commission shall provide medical assistance reimbursement for preventive dental services, including reimbursement for one preventive dental care visit per year, for an adult recipient with a disability who is enrolled in the STAR+PLUS Medicaid managed care program.  This subsection does not apply to an adult recipient who is enrolled in the STAR+PLUS home and community-based services (HCBS) waiver program.  This subsection may not be construed to reduce dental services available to persons with disabilities that are otherwise reimbursable under the medical assistance program.
