    (a)  To be eligible for appointment as a probation officer, a person who was not employed as a probation officer before September 1, 1981, must:
    
    (1)  have satisfactorily completed the course of preservice training or instruction and any continuing education required by the department;
    
    (2)  have passed the tests or examinations required by the department; and

    (b-1)  The department by rule shall establish, with input from the advisory council on juvenile services and other relevant stakeholders, the minimum education and experience requirements a person must meet to be eligible for a juvenile probation officer certification.  Rules adopted by the department under this subsection must be the least restrictive rules possible to ensure certified juvenile probation officers are qualified to protect children and public safety without creating barriers to entry into the profession.
    
    (c)  The board by rule may authorize the temporary employment of a person who has not completed a course of preservice training, passed the examination, or attained the required level of certification, contingent on the person meeting those requirements within the time specified by the board.
    
    (d)  A person must possess the level of training, experience, and certification required by the department to be eligible for employment in a probation office in a position supervising other probation officers.
