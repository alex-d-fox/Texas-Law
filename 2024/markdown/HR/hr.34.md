    CHAPTER 34. STATE TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT SERVICES PROGRAM
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 34.001.  DEFINITIONS.  In this chapter:
    
    (1)  "Related support services" means services considered under federal law to be a component of money payments for purposes of the financial assistance program authorized by Chapter [31](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HR&Value=31).
    
    (2)  "Temporary assistance" means money payments for needy persons authorized by this chapter.

    Sec. 34.002.  DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF STATE PROGRAM;  FUNDING.  (a)  The Health and Human Services Commission and the Texas Workforce Commission, with the participation of local workforce development boards, shall jointly develop and implement a state program of temporary assistance and related support services that is distinct from the financial assistance program authorized by Chapter [31](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HR&Value=31).
    
    (b)  Temporary assistance and related support services may be provided under the state program only to:
    
    (1)  two-parent families;  or
    
    (2)  persons residing in minimum service counties, as defined by the Texas Workforce Commission.
    
    (c)  Temporary assistance and related support services provided under the state program may not be funded with federal money provided to the state for the financial assistance program authorized by Chapter [31](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HR&Value=31).
    
    (d)  If federal law is enacted that imposes work participation rate requirements on two-parent families for purposes of the financial assistance program under Chapter [31](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HR&Value=31) that are substantively identical to those that federal law imposes on one-parent families for purposes of that program, the Health and Human Services Commission may, on the effective date of the federal law relating to the work participation rate requirements for two-parent families, provide for establishment of that recipient's eligibility for financial assistance under Chapter [31](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HR&Value=31) instead of under this chapter in a manner that avoids disruption of benefits for which the recipient is eligible.
