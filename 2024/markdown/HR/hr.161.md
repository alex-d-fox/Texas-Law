The period may not be less than 45 days.
    
    (f)  The commission may assess an administrative penalty without providing a reasonable period of time to a provider to correct the violation if the violation:
    
    (1)  represents a pattern of violation that results in actual harm;
    
    (2)  is widespread in scope and results in actual harm;
    
    (3)  is widespread in scope and constitutes a potential for actual harm;
    
    (4)  constitutes an immediate threat to the health or safety of a recipient;
    
    (5)  substantially limits the provider's ability to provide care; or
    
    (6)  is a violation in which a provider:
    
    (A)  wilfully interferes with the work of a representative of the commission or the enforcement of a law relating to a program to which this section applies;
    
    (B)  fails to pay a penalty assessed by the commission under this section not later than the 10th day after the date the assessment of the penalty becomes final, subject to Section 161.0891; or

    (2)  the risk factors associated with falling increase with age;

    (5)  research shows that a well-designed fall prevention program that includes risk factor assessments, a focused physical activity program, and improvement of the home environment can reduce the incidence of falls by 30 to 50 percent.
