    Sec. 1.001.  PURPOSE OF CODE.  (a)  This code is enacted as a part of the state's continuing statutory revision program, begun by the Texas Legislative Council in 1963 as directed by the legislature in Chapter 488, Acts of the 58th Legislature, 1963 (Article 5429b-1, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes).  The program contemplates a topic-by-topic revision of the state's general and permanent statute law without substantive change.
    
    (b)  Consistent with the objectives of the statutory revision program, the purpose of this code is to make the general and permanent parks and wildlife law more accessible and understandable by:
    
    (1)  rearranging the statutes into a more logical order;
    
    (2)  employing a format and numbering system designed to facilitate citation of the law and to accommodate future expansion of the law;
    
    (3)  eliminating repealed, duplicative, unconstitutional, expired, executed, and other ineffective provisions;  and
    
    (4)  restating the law in modern American English to the greatest extent possible.
