The commission shall have power to recommend the coordination of the exercise of the police powers of the several States within their respective jurisdictions to promote the preservation of these fisheries and their protection against over-fishing, waste, depletion or any abuse whatsoever, and to assure a continuing yield from the fishery resources of the aforementioned States.
