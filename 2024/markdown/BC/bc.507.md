    Sec. 507.001.  CONCEALED HANDGUN LICENSE AS VALID PROOF OF IDENTIFICATION.  (a)  A person may not deny the holder of a concealed handgun license issued under Subchapter [H](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=411.171), Chapter [411](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=411), Government Code, access to goods, services, or facilities, except as provided by Section [521.460](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TN&Value=521.460), Transportation Code, or in regard to the operation of a motor vehicle, because the holder has or presents a concealed handgun license rather than a driver's license or other acceptable form of personal identification.

    (1)  the requirement under Section [411.205](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=411.205), Government Code, that a person subject to that section present a driver's license or identification certificate in addition to a concealed handgun license; or
    
    (2)  the types of identification required under federal law to access airport premises or pass through airport security.
