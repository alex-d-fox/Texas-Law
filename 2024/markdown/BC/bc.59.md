A disclosure under this subsection is made in the contractor's capacity as contractor and not as a licensed professional under Title 6, Occupations Code.
    
    (c)  A contractor who fails to disclose a defect as required by Subsection (b) may be liable for the consequences of defects that result from the failure to disclose.
