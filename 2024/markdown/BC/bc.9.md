    Sec. 9.103.  PURCHASE-MONEY SECURITY INTEREST;  APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS;  BURDEN OF ESTABLISHING.  (a)  In this section:
    
    (1)  "Purchase-money collateral" means goods or software that secures a purchase-money obligation incurred with respect to that collateral.
    
    (2)  "Purchase-money obligation" means an obligation of an obligor incurred as all or part of the price of the collateral or for value given to enable the debtor to acquire rights in or the use of the collateral if the value is in fact so used.
    
    (b)  A security interest in goods is a purchase-money security interest:
    
    (1)  to the extent that the goods are purchase-money collateral with respect to that security interest;
    
    (2)  if the security interest is in inventory that is or was purchase-money collateral, also to the extent that the security interest secures a purchase-money obligation incurred with respect to other inventory in which the secured party holds or held a purchase-money security interest;  and
    
    (3)  also to the extent that the security interest secures a purchase-money obligation incurred with respect to software in which the secured party holds or held a purchase-money security interest.
    
    (c)  A security interest in software is a purchase-money security interest to the extent that the security interest also secures a purchase-money obligation incurred with respect to goods in which the secured party holds or held a purchase-money security interest if:
    
    (1)  the debtor acquired its interest in the software in an integrated transaction in which it acquired an interest in the goods;  and
    
    (2)  the debtor acquired its interest in the software for the principal purpose of using the software in the goods.
    
    (d)  The security interest of a consignor in goods that are the subject of a consignment is a purchase-money security interest in inventory.
    
    (e)  In a transaction other than a consumer-goods transaction, if the extent to which a security interest is a purchase-money security interest depends on the application of a payment to a particular obligation, the payment must be applied:
    
    (1)  in accordance with any reasonable method of application to which the parties agree;
    
    (2)  in the absence of the parties' agreement to a reasonable method, in accordance with any intention of the obligor manifested at or before the time of payment;  or
    
    (3)  in the absence of an agreement to a reasonable method and a timely manifestation of the obligor's intention, in the following order:
    
    (A)  to obligations that are not secured;  and
    
    (B)  if more than one obligation is secured, to obligations secured by purchase-money security interests in the order in which those obligations were incurred.
    
    (f)  In a transaction other than a consumer-goods transaction, a purchase-money security interest does not lose its status as such, even if:
    
    (1)  the purchase-money collateral also secures an obligation that is not a purchase-money obligation;
    
    (2)  collateral that is not purchase-money collateral also secures the purchase-money obligation;  or
    
    (3)  the purchase-money obligation has been renewed, refinanced, consolidated, or restructured.
    
    (g)  In a transaction other than a consumer-goods transaction, a secured party claiming a purchase-money security interest has the burden of establishing the extent to which the security interest is a purchase-money security interest.
    
    (h)  The limitation of the rules in Subsections (e), (f), and (g) to transactions other than consumer-goods transactions is intended to leave to the court the determination of the proper rules in consumer-goods transactions.  The court may not infer from that limitation the nature of the proper rule in consumer-goods transactions and may continue to apply established approaches.

    (e)  The application of this chapter to the sale of accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, or promissory notes is not to recharacterize that sale as a transaction to secure indebtedness but to protect purchasers of those assets by providing a notice filing system.  For all purposes, in the absence of fraud or intentional misrepresentation, the parties' characterization of a transaction as a sale of such assets shall be conclusive that the transaction is a sale and is not a secured transaction and that title, legal and equitable, has passed to the party characterized as the purchaser of those assets regardless of whether the secured party has any recourse against the debtor, whether the debtor is entitled to any surplus, or any other term of the parties' agreement.

    (h)  A secured party having possession of collateral does not relinquish possession by delivering the collateral to a person other than the debtor or a lessee of the collateral from the debtor in the ordinary course of the debtor's business if the person was instructed before the delivery or is instructed contemporaneously with the delivery:
    
    (1)  to hold possession of the collateral for the secured party's benefit;  or
    
    (2)  to redeliver the collateral to the secured party.

    (2)  If a security interest that is perfected by a financing statement that is effective under Subdivision (1) becomes perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier of the time the financing statement would have become ineffective under the law of the jurisdiction designated in Section [9.301](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.301)(1) or [9.305](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.305)(c) or the expiration of the four-month period, it remains perfected thereafter.  If the security interest does not become perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier time or event, it becomes unperfected and is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value.
    
    (i)  If a financing statement naming an original debtor is filed pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction designated in Section [9.301](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.301)(1) or [9.305](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.305)(c) and the new debtor is located in another jurisdiction, the following rules apply:
    
    (1)  The financing statement is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral in which the new debtor has or acquires rights before or within four months after the new debtor becomes bound under Section [9.203](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.203)(d), if the financing statement would have been effective to perfect a security interest in the collateral if the collateral had been acquired by the original debtor.
    
    (2)  A security interest that is perfected by the financing statement and that becomes perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier of the expiration of the four-month period or the time the financing statement would have become ineffective under the law of the jurisdiction designated in Section [9.301](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.301)(1) or [9.305](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.305)(c) remains perfected thereafter.

    (1)  Conflicting perfected security interests and agricultural liens rank according to priority in time of filing or perfection.  Priority dates from the earlier of the time a filing covering the collateral is first made or the security interest or agricultural lien is first perfected, if there is no period thereafter when there is neither filing nor perfection.
    
    (2)  A perfected security interest or agricultural lien has priority over a conflicting unperfected security interest or agricultural lien.

    (b)  For the purposes of Subsection (a)(1):
    
    (1)  the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in collateral is also the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in proceeds;  and

    (2)  proceeds of the collateral if:
    
    (A)  the security interest in proceeds is perfected;
    
    (B)  the proceeds are cash proceeds or of the same type as the collateral;  and
    
    (C)  in the case of proceeds that are proceeds of proceeds, all intervening proceeds are cash proceeds, proceeds of the same type as the collateral, or an account relating to the collateral.
    
    (d)  Subject to Subsection (e) and except as otherwise provided in Subsection (f), if a security interest in chattel paper, deposit accounts, negotiable documents, instruments, investment property, or letter-of-credit rights is perfected by a method other than filing, conflicting perfected security interests in proceeds of the collateral rank according to priority in time of filing.

    (2)  45 days after the lease contract becomes enforceable.

    (1)  Section [9.322](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.322) provides for priority in the proceeds;  or

    (e)  For purposes of Subsections (a) and (b), the holder of a purchase-money security interest in inventory gives new value for chattel paper constituting proceeds of the inventory.
    
    (f)  For purposes of Subsections (b) and (d), if chattel paper or an instrument indicates that it has been assigned to an identified secured party other than the purchaser, a purchaser of the chattel paper or instrument has knowledge that the purchase violates the rights of the secured party.

    Sec. 9.334.  PRIORITY OF SECURITY INTERESTS IN FIXTURES AND CROPS.

A security interest does not exist under this chapter in ordinary building materials incorporated into an improvement on land.
    
    (b)  This chapter does not prevent creation of an encumbrance upon fixtures under real property law.
    
    (c)  In cases not governed by Subsections (d)-(h), a security interest in fixtures is subordinate to a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the related real property other than the debtor.
    
    (d)  Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (h), a perfected security interest in fixtures has priority over the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if the debtor has an interest of record in or is in possession of the real property and:
    
    (1)  the security interest is a purchase-money security interest;
    
    (2)  the interest of the encumbrancer or owner arises before the goods become fixtures;  and
    
    (3)  the security interest is perfected by a fixture filing before the goods become fixtures or within 20 days thereafter.
    
    (e)  A perfected security interest in fixtures has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if:
    
    (1)  the debtor has an interest of record in the real property or is in possession of the real property and the security interest:
    
    (A)  is perfected by a fixture filing before the interest of the encumbrancer or owner is of record;  and
    
    (B)  has priority over any conflicting interest of a predecessor in title of the encumbrancer or owner;
    
    (2)  before the goods become fixtures, the security interest is perfected by any method permitted by this chapter and the fixtures are readily removable:
    
    (A)  factory or office machines;
    
    (B)  equipment that is not primarily used or leased for use in the operation of the real property;  or
    
    (C)  replacements of domestic appliances that are consumer goods;
    
    (3)  the conflicting interest is a lien on the real property obtained by legal or equitable proceedings after the security interest was perfected by any method permitted by this chapter;  or
    
    (4)  the security interest is:
    
    (A)  created in a manufactured home in a manufactured-home transaction;  and
    
    (B)  perfected pursuant to a statute described in Section [9.311](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.311)(a)(2).
    
    (f)  A security interest in fixtures, whether or not perfected, has priority over the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if:
    
    (1)  the encumbrancer or owner has, in an authenticated record, consented to the security interest or disclaimed an interest in the goods as fixtures;  or
    
    (2)  the debtor has a right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner.
    
    (g)  The priority of the security interest under Subsection (f)(2) continues for a reasonable time if the debtor's right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner terminates.
    
    (h)  A mortgage is a construction mortgage to the extent that it secures an obligation incurred for the construction of an improvement on land, including the acquisition cost of the land, if a recorded record of the mortgage so indicates.  Except as otherwise provided in Subsections (e) and (f), a security interest in fixtures is subordinate to a construction mortgage if a record of the mortgage is recorded before the goods become fixtures before the completion of the construction.  A mortgage has this priority to the same extent as a construction mortgage to the extent that it is given to refinance a construction mortgage.
    
    (i)  A perfected security interest in crops growing on real property has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if the debtor has an interest of record in or is in possession of the real property.

    (b)  If a security interest is perfected when the collateral becomes an accession, the security interest remains perfected in the collateral.
    
    (c)  Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (d), the other provisions of this subchapter determine the priority of a security interest in an accession.
    
    (d)  A security interest in an accession is subordinate to a security interest in the whole that is perfected by compliance with the requirements of a certificate-of-title statute under Section [9.311](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.311)(b).
    
    (e)  After default, subject to Subchapter F, a secured party may remove an accession from other goods if the security interest in the accession has priority over the claims of every person having an interest in the whole.
    
    (f)  A secured party that removes an accession from other goods under Subsection (e) shall promptly reimburse any holder of a security interest or other lien on, or owner of, the whole or the other goods, other than the debtor, for the cost of repair of any physical injury to the whole or the other goods.  The secured party need not reimburse the holder or owner for any diminution in value of the whole or the other goods caused by the absence of the accession removed or by any necessity for replacing it. A person entitled to reimbursement may refuse permission to remove until the secured party gives adequate assurance for the performance of the obligation to reimburse.

    (b)  A security interest does not exist in commingled goods as such.  However, a security interest may attach to a product or mass that results when goods become commingled goods.
    
    (c)  If collateral becomes commingled goods, a security interest attaches to the product or mass.
    
    (d)  If a security interest in collateral is perfected before the collateral becomes commingled goods, the security interest that attaches to the product or mass under Subsection (c) is perfected.
    
    (e)  Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (f), the other provisions of this subchapter determine the priority of a security interest that attaches to the product or mass under Subsection (c).
    
    (f)  If more than one security interest attaches to the product or mass under Subsection (c), the following rules determine priority:
    
    (1)  A security interest that is perfected under Subsection (d) has priority over a security interest that is unperfected at the time the collateral becomes commingled goods.
    
    (2)  If more than one security interest is perfected under Subsection (d), the security interests rank equally in proportion to the value of the collateral at the time it became commingled goods.

    (1)  a buyer of the goods, other than a person in the business of selling goods of that kind, takes free of the security interest if the buyer gives value and receives delivery of the goods after issuance of the certificate and without knowledge of the security interest;  and
    
    (2)  the security interest is subordinate to a conflicting security interest in the goods that attaches, and is perfected under Section [9.311](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.311)(b), after issuance of the certificate and without the conflicting secured party's knowledge of the security interest.

    (1)  the security interest or agricultural lien is subordinate to a conflicting perfected security interest in the collateral to the extent that the holder of the conflicting security interest gives value in reasonable reliance upon the incorrect information; and
    
    (2)  a purchaser, other than a secured party, of the collateral takes free of the security interest or agricultural lien to the extent that, in reasonable reliance upon the incorrect information, the purchaser gives value and, in the case of tangible chattel paper, tangible documents, goods, instruments, or a security certificate, receives delivery of the collateral.

    (1)  all terms of the agreement between the account debtor and assignor and any defense or claim in recoupment arising from the transaction that gave rise to the contract;  and

    Sec. 9.406.  DISCHARGE OF ACCOUNT DEBTOR;  NOTIFICATION OF ASSIGNMENT;  IDENTIFICATION AND PROOF OF ASSIGNMENT;  RESTRICTIONS ON ASSIGNMENT OF ACCOUNTS, CHATTEL PAPER, PAYMENT INTANGIBLES, AND PROMISSORY NOTES INEFFECTIVE.  (a)  Subject to Subsections (b)-(i), an account debtor on an account, chattel paper, or a payment intangible may discharge its obligation by paying the assignor until, but not after, the account debtor receives a notification, authenticated by the assignor or the assignee, that the amount due or to become due has been assigned and that payment is to be made to the assignee.  After receipt of the notification, the account debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the assignee and may not discharge the obligation by paying the assignor.
    
    (b)  Subject to Subsection (h), notification is ineffective under Subsection (a):
    
    (1)  if it does not reasonably identify the rights assigned;
    
    (2)  to the extent that an agreement between an account debtor and a seller of a payment intangible limits the account debtor's duty to pay a person other than the seller and the limitation is effective under law other than this chapter;  or
    
    (3)  at the option of an account debtor, if the notification notifies the account debtor to make less than the full amount of any installment or other periodic payment to the assignee, even if:
    
    (A)  only a portion of the account, chattel paper, or payment intangible has been assigned to that assignee;
    
    (B)  a portion has been assigned to another assignee;  or
    
    (C)  the account debtor knows that the assignment to that assignee is limited.
    
    (c)  Subject to Subsection (h), if requested by the account debtor, an assignee shall seasonably furnish reasonable proof that the assignment has been made.  Unless the assignee complies, the account debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the assignor, even if the account debtor has received a notification under Subsection (a).
    
    (d)  Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (e) and Sections [2A.303](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=2A.303) and [9.407](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.407), and subject to Subsection (h), a term in an agreement between an account debtor and an assignor or in a promissory note is ineffective to the extent that it:
    
    (1)  prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of the account debtor or person obligated on the promissory note to the assignment or transfer of, or the creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in, the account, chattel paper, payment intangible, or promissory note;  or
    
    (2)  provides that the assignment or transfer or the creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or remedy under the account, chattel paper, payment intangible, or promissory note.
    
    (e)  Subsection (d) does not apply to the sale of a payment intangible or promissory note, other than a sale pursuant to a disposition under Section [9.610](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.610) or an acceptance of collateral under Section [9.620](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.620).

    (1)  prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of the government, governmental body or official, or account debtor to the assignment or transfer of, or the creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in, the account or chattel paper; or
    
    (2)  provides that the assignment or transfer or the creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or remedy under the account or chattel paper.
    
    (g)  Subject to Subsection (h), an account debtor may not waive or vary its option under Subsection (b)(3).
    
    (h)  This section is subject to law other than this chapter that establishes a different rule for an account debtor who is an individual and who incurred the obligation primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.
    
    (i)  This section does not apply to an assignment of a health-care-insurance receivable.
    
    (j)  This section does not apply to an interest in a partnership or limited liability company.
    
    (k)  An assignment under this section is subject to Section [466.410](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=466.410), Government Code, except to the extent that Section [466.410](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=466.410)(a), Government Code, prohibits the assignment of installment prize payments due within the final two years of the prize payment schedule, in which case this section shall prevail over Section [466.410](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=466.410) solely to the extent necessary to permit such assignment.

    (1)  prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of a party to the lease to the assignment or transfer of, or the creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in, an interest of a party under the lease contract or in the lessor's residual interest in the goods;  or
    
    (2)  provides that the assignment or transfer or the creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or remedy under the lease.
    
    (b)  Except as otherwise provided in Section [2A.303](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=2A.303)(g), a term described in Subsection (a)(2) is effective to the extent that there is:
    
    (1)  a transfer by the lessee of the lessee's right of possession or use of the goods in violation of the term;  or
    
    (2)  a delegation of a material performance of either party to the lease contract in violation of the term.
    
    (c)  The creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in the lessor's interest under the lease contract or the lessor's residual interest in the goods is not a transfer that materially impairs the lessee's prospect of obtaining return performance or materially changes the duty of or materially increases the burden or risk imposed on the lessee within the purview of Section [2A.303](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=2A.303)(d) unless, and then only to the extent that, enforcement actually results in a delegation of material performance of the lessor.

    (1)  would impair the creation, attachment, or perfection of a security interest;  or
    
    (2)  provides that the assignment or transfer or the creation, attachment, or perfection of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or remedy under the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible.

    (b)  The office in which to file a financing statement to perfect a security interest in collateral, including fixtures, of a transmitting utility is the office of the Secretary of State.  The financing statement also constitutes a fixture filing as to the collateral indicated in the financing statement that is or is to become fixtures.

    Sec. 9.502.  CONTENTS OF FINANCING STATEMENT;  RECORD OF MORTGAGE AS FINANCING STATEMENT;  TIME OF FILING FINANCING STATEMENT.  (a)  Subject to Subsection (b), a financing statement is sufficient only if it:
    
    (1)  provides the name of the debtor;
    
    (2)  provides the name of the secured party or a representative of the secured party;  and
    
    (3)  indicates the collateral covered by the financing statement.
    
    (b)  Except as otherwise provided in Section [9.501](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.501)(b), to be sufficient, a financing statement that covers as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut, or that is filed as a fixture filing and covers goods that are or are to become fixtures, must satisfy Subsection (a) and also:
    
    (1)  indicate that it covers this type of collateral;
    
    (2)  indicate that it is to be filed for record in the real property records;
    
    (3)  provide a description of the real property to which the collateral is related sufficient to give constructive notice of a mortgage under the law of this state if the description were contained in a record of the mortgage of the real property;  and
    
    (4)  if the debtor does not have an interest of record in the real property, provide the name of a record owner.
    
    (c)  A record of a mortgage is effective, from the date of recording, as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing or as a financing statement covering as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut only if:
    
    (1)  the record indicates the goods or accounts that it covers;
    
    (2)  the goods are or are to become fixtures related to the real property described in the record or the collateral is related to the real property described in the record and is as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut;

    (4)  the record is duly recorded.

    Sec. 9.503.  NAME OF DEBTOR AND SECURED PARTY.  (a)  A financing statement sufficiently provides the name of the debtor:
    
    (1)  except as otherwise provided in Subdivision (3), if the debtor is a registered organization or the collateral is held in a trust that is a registered organization, only if the financing statement provides the name that is stated to be the registered organization's name on the public organic record most recently filed with or issued or enacted by the registered organization's jurisdiction of organization that purports to state, amend, or restate the registered organization's name;
    
    (2)  subject to Subsection (f), if the collateral is being administered by the personal representative of a decedent, only if the financing statement provides, as the name of the debtor, the name of the decedent and, in a separate part of the financing statement, indicates that the collateral is being administered by a personal representative;
    
    (3)  if the collateral is held in a trust that is not a registered organization, only if the financing statement:
    
    (A)  provides, as the name of the debtor:
    
    (i)  if the organic record of the trust specifies a name for the trust, the name so specified; or
    
    (ii)  if the organic record of the trust does not specify a name for the trust, the name of the settlor or testator; and
    
    (B)  in a separate part of the financing statement:
    
    (i)  if the name is provided in accordance with Paragraph (A)(i), indicates that the collateral is held in a trust; or
    
    (ii)  if the name is provided in accordance with Paragraph (A)(ii), provides additional information sufficient to distinguish the trust from other trusts having one or more of the same settlors or the same testator and indicates that the collateral is held in a trust, unless the additional information so indicates;
    
    (4)  subject to Subsection (g), if the debtor is an individual to whom this state has issued a driver's license that has not expired or to whom the agency of this state that issues driver's licenses has issued, in lieu of a driver's license, a personal identification card that has not expired, only if the financing statement provides the name of the individual that is indicated on the driver's license or personal identification card;
    
    (5)  if the debtor is an individual to whom Subdivision (4) does not apply, only if the financing statement provides the individual name of the debtor or the surname and first personal name of the debtor; and
    
    (6)  in other cases:
    
    (A)  if the debtor has a name, only if it provides the organizational name of the debtor; and
    
    (B)  if the debtor does not have a name, only if it provides the names of the partners, members, associates, or other persons comprising the debtor, in a manner that each name provided would be sufficient if the person named were the debtor.
    
    (b)  A financing statement that provides the name of the debtor in accordance with Subsection (a) is not rendered ineffective by the absence of:
    
    (1)  a trade name or other name of the debtor; or
    
    (2)  unless required under Subsection (a)(6)(B), names of partners, members, associates, or other persons comprising the debtor.
    
    (c)  A financing statement that provides only the debtor's trade name does not sufficiently provide the name of the debtor.
    
    (d)  Failure to indicate the representative capacity of a secured party or representative of a secured party does not affect the sufficiency of a financing statement.
    
    (e)  A financing statement may provide the name of more than one debtor and the name of more than one secured party.
    
    (f)  The name of the decedent indicated on the order appointing the personal representative of the decedent issued by the court having jurisdiction over the collateral is sufficient as the "name of the decedent" under Subsection (a)(2).
    
    (g)  If this state has issued to an individual more than one driver's license or, if none, more than one identification card, of a kind described in Subsection (a)(4), the driver's license or identification card, as applicable, that was issued most recently is the one to which Subsection (a)(4) refers.
    
    (h)  The "name of the settlor or testator" means:
    
    (1)  if the settlor is a registered organization, the name of the registered organization indicated on the public organic record filed with or issued or enacted by the registered organization's jurisdiction of organization; or
    
    (2)  in other cases, the name of the settlor or testator indicated in the trust's organic record.

If it is determined for another reason that the collateral secures an obligation, a security interest held by the consignor, lessor, bailor, licensor, owner, or buyer that attaches to the collateral is perfected by the filing or compliance.

    Sec. 9.506.  EFFECT OF ERRORS OR OMISSIONS.  (a)  A financing statement substantially satisfying the requirements of this subchapter is effective, even if it has minor errors or omissions, unless the errors or omissions make the financing statement seriously misleading.
    
    (b)  Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (c), a financing statement that fails sufficiently to provide the name of the debtor in accordance with Section [9.503](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.503)(a) is seriously misleading.
    
    (c)  If a search of the records of the filing office under the debtor's correct name, using the filing office's standard search logic, if any, would disclose a financing statement that fails sufficiently to provide the name of the debtor in accordance with Section [9.503](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.503)(a), the name provided does not make the financing statement seriously misleading.
    
    (d)  For purposes of Section [9.508](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.508)(b), the "debtor's correct name" in Subsection (c) means the correct name of the new debtor.

    (b)  Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (c) and Section [9.508](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.508), a financing statement is not rendered ineffective if, after the financing statement is filed, the information provided in the financing statement becomes seriously misleading under Section [9.506](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.506).
    
    (c)  If the name that a filed financing statement provides for a debtor becomes insufficient as the name of the debtor under Section [9.503](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.503)(a) so that the financing statement becomes seriously misleading under Section [9.506](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.506):
    
    (1)  the financing statement is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the debtor before, or within four months after, the filed financing statement becomes seriously misleading; and
    
    (2)  the financing statement is not effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the debtor more than four months after the filed financing statement becomes seriously misleading, unless an amendment to the financing statement that renders the financing statement not seriously misleading is filed within four months after that event.

Upon the expiration of the five-year period, the financing statement lapses in the same manner as provided in Subsection (c), unless, before the lapse, another continuation statement is filed pursuant to Subsection (d).  Succeeding continuation statements may be filed in the same manner to continue the effectiveness of the initial financing statement.

    (B)  indicate whether the name provided as the name of the debtor is the name of an individual or an organization;

    (1)  the reasonable expenses of retaking, holding, preparing for disposition, processing, and disposing and, to the extent provided for by agreement and not prohibited by law, reasonable attorney's fees and legal expenses incurred by the secured party;
    
    (2)  the satisfaction of obligations secured by the security interest or agricultural lien under which the disposition is made;

    (B)  in a case in which a consignor has an interest in the collateral, the subordinate security interest or other lien is senior to the interest of the consignor;  and
    
    (4)  a secured party that is a consignor of the collateral if the secured party receives from the consignor an authenticated demand for proceeds before distribution of the proceeds is completed.
    
    (b)  If requested by a secured party, a holder of a subordinate security interest or other lien shall furnish reasonable proof of the interest or lien within a reasonable time.  Unless the holder does so, the secured party need not comply with the holder's demand under Subsection (a)(3).

    (1)  the transferee in the disposition is the secured party, a person related to the secured party, or a secondary obligor;  and
    
    (2)  the amount of proceeds of the disposition is significantly below the range of proceeds that a complying disposition to a person other than the secured party, a person related to the secured party, or a secondary obligor would have brought.

    (2)  is not obligated to apply the proceeds of the disposition to the satisfaction of obligations secured by the security interest or other lien;  and
    
    (3)  is not obligated to account to or pay the holder of the security interest or other lien for any surplus.

    (f)  A debtor or consumer obligor may recover damages under Subsection (b) and, in addition, $500 in each case from a person that, without reasonable cause, fails to comply with a request under Section [9.210](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.210).  A recipient of a request under Section [9.210](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.210) that never claimed an interest in the collateral or obligations that are the subject of a request under that section has a reasonable excuse for failure to comply with the request within the meaning of this subsection.
    
    (g)  If a secured party fails to comply with a request regarding a list of collateral or a statement of account under Section [9.210](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.210), the secured party may claim a security interest only as shown in the list or statement included in the request as against a person that is reasonably misled by the failure.

    Sec. 9.626.  ACTION IN WHICH DEFICIENCY OR SURPLUS IS IN ISSUE.  (a)  In an action arising from a transaction, other than a consumer transaction, in which the amount of a deficiency or surplus is in issue, the following rules apply:
    
    (1)  A secured party need not prove compliance with the provisions of this subchapter relating to collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance unless the debtor or a secondary obligor places the secured party's compliance in issue.
    
    (2)  If the secured party's compliance is placed in issue, the secured party has the burden of establishing that the collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance was conducted in accordance with this subchapter.
    
    (3)  Except as otherwise provided in Section [9.628](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.628), if a secured party fails to prove that the collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance was conducted in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter relating to collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance, the liability of a debtor or a secondary obligor for a deficiency is limited to an amount by which the sum of the secured obligation, expenses, and attorney's fees exceeds the greater of:
    
    (A)  the proceeds of the collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance;  or
    
    (B)  the amount of proceeds that would have been realized had the noncomplying secured party proceeded in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter relating to collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance.
    
    (4)  For purposes of Subdivision (3)(B), the amount of proceeds that would have been realized is equal to the sum of the secured obligation, expenses, and attorney's fees unless the secured party proves that the amount is less than that sum.
    
    (5)  If a deficiency or surplus is calculated under Section [9.615](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.615)(f), the debtor or obligor has the burden of establishing that the amount of proceeds of the disposition is significantly below the range of prices that a complying disposition to a person other than the secured party, a person related to the secured party, or a secondary obligor would have brought.
    
    (b)  The limitation of the rules in Subsection (a) to transactions other than consumer transactions is intended to leave to the court the determination of the proper rules in consumer transactions.  The court may not infer from that limitation the nature of the proper rule in consumer transactions and may continue to apply established approaches.

    Sec. 9.627.  DETERMINATION OF WHETHER CONDUCT WAS COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE.  (a)  The fact that a greater amount could have been obtained by a collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance at a different time or in a different method from that selected by the secured party is not of itself sufficient to preclude the secured party from establishing that the collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance was made in a commercially reasonable manner.
    
    (b)  A disposition of collateral is made in a commercially reasonable manner if the disposition is made:
    
    (1)  in the usual manner on any recognized market;
    
    (2)  at the price current in any recognized market at the time of the disposition;  or
    
    (3)  otherwise in conformity with reasonable commercial practices among dealers in the type of property that was the subject of the disposition.
    
    (c)  A collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance is commercially reasonable if it has been approved:
    
    (1)  in a judicial proceeding;
    
    (2)  by a bona fide creditors' committee;
    
    (3)  by a representative of creditors;  or
    
    (4)  by an assignee for the benefit of creditors.
    
    (d)  Approval under Subsection (c) need not be obtained, and lack of approval does not mean that the collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance is not commercially reasonable.

    Sec. 9.628.  NONLIABILITY AND LIMITATION ON LIABILITY OF SECURED PARTY;  LIABILITY OF SECONDARY OBLIGOR.  (a)  Unless a secured party knows that a person is a debtor or obligor, knows the identity of the person, and knows how to communicate with the person:
    
    (1)  the secured party is not liable to the person, or to a secured party or lienholder that has filed a financing statement against the person, for failure to comply with this chapter;  and
    
    (2)  the secured party's failure to comply with this chapter does not affect the liability of the person for a deficiency.
    
    (b)  A secured party is not liable because of its status as secured party:
    
    (1)  to a person that is a debtor or obligor, unless the secured party knows:
    
    (A)  that the person is a debtor or obligor;
    
    (B)  the identity of the person;  and
    
    (C)  how to communicate with the person;  or

    (A)  that the person is a debtor;  and
    
    (B)  the identity of the person.
    
    (c)  A secured party is not liable to any person, and a person's liability for a deficiency is not affected, because of any act or omission arising out of the secured party's reasonable belief that a transaction is not a consumer-goods transaction or a consumer transaction or that goods are not consumer goods, if the secured party's belief is based on its reasonable reliance on:
    
    (1)  a debtor's representation concerning the purpose for which collateral was to be used, acquired, or held;  or
    
    (2)  an obligor's representation concerning the purpose for which a secured obligation was incurred.
    
    (d)  A secured party is not liable to any person under Section [9.625](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.625)(c)(2) for its failure to comply with Section [9.616](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.616).
    
    (e)  A secured party is not liable under Section [9.625](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.625)(c)(2) more than once with respect to any one secured obligation.

    (1)  transactions and liens that were not governed by this chapter, as it existed immediately before the effective date of the revision, were validly entered into or created before the effective date of the revision, and would be subject to this chapter, as revised, if they had been entered into or created on or after the effective date of the revision, and the rights, duties, and interests flowing from those transactions and liens remain valid on and after the effective date of the revision;  and
    
    (2)  the transactions and liens may be terminated, completed, consummated, and enforced as required or permitted by this chapter, as revised, or by the law that otherwise would apply if the revision had not taken effect.
    
    (c)  The revision does not affect an action, case, or proceeding commenced before the effective date of the revision.

    Sec. 9.703.   SECURITY INTEREST PERFECTED BEFORE EFFECTIVE DATE.  (a)  A security interest that is enforceable immediately before the effective date of the revision and would have priority over the rights of a person that becomes a lien creditor at that time is a perfected security interest under this chapter, as revised, if, on the effective date of the revision, the applicable requirements for enforceability and perfection under this chapter, as revised, are satisfied without further action.
    
    (b)  Except as otherwise provided in Section [9.705](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.705), if, immediately before the revision takes effect, a security interest is enforceable and would have priority over the rights of a person that becomes a lien creditor at that time, but the applicable requirements for enforceability or perfection under this chapter, as revised, are not satisfied when the revision takes effect, the security interest:
    
    (1)  is a perfected security interest until July 1, 2002;
    
    (2)  remains enforceable after June 30, 2002, only if the security interest becomes enforceable under Section [9.203](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.203), as revised, before July 1, 2002;  and

    (1)  remains an enforceable security interest until July 1, 2002;
    
    (2)  remains enforceable after June 30, 2002, if the security interest becomes enforceable under Section [9.203](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.203), as revised, before July 1, 2002;  and
    
    (3)  becomes perfected:
    
    (A)  without further action, when the revision takes effect, if the applicable requirements for perfection under this chapter, as revised, are satisfied before or at that time;  or

    Sec. 9.705.   EFFECTIVENESS OF ACTION TAKEN BEFORE EFFECTIVE DATE.  (a)  If action, other than the filing of a financing statement, is taken before the revision takes effect and the action would have resulted in priority of a security interest over the rights of a person that becomes a lien creditor had the security interest become enforceable before the revision takes effect, the action is effective to perfect a security interest that attaches under this chapter, as revised, within one year after the effective date of the revision. An attached security interest becomes unperfected on July 1, 2002, unless the security interest becomes a perfected security interest under this chapter, as revised, before that date.
    
    (b)  The filing of a financing statement before the effective date of the revision is effective to perfect a security interest to the extent the filing would satisfy the applicable requirements for perfection under this chapter, as revised.
    
    (c)  The revision does not render ineffective an effective financing statement that, before the effective date of the revision, is filed and satisfies the applicable requirements for perfection under the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in Section [9.103](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.103), as it existed immediately before the effective date of the revision.  However, except as otherwise provided in Subsections (d), (e), and (g) and Section [9.706](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.706), the financing statement ceases to be effective at the earlier of:
    
    (1)  the time the financing statement would have ceased to be effective under the law of the jurisdiction in which it is filed; or
    
    (2)  June 30, 2006.
    
    (d)  The filing of a continuation statement after the revision takes effect does not continue the effectiveness of the financing statement filed before the revision takes effect.  However, upon the timely filing of a continuation statement after the revision takes effect and in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in Subchapter C,  as revised, the effectiveness of a financing statement filed in the same office in that jurisdiction before the revision takes effect continues for the period provided by the law of that jurisdiction.
    
    (e)  Subsection (c)(2) applies to a financing statement that, before the revision takes effect, is filed against a transmitting utility and satisfies the applicable requirements for perfection under the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in Section [9.103](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.103), as it existed immediately before the effective date of the revision, only to the extent that Subchapter C, as revised, provides that the law of a jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction in which the financing statement is filed governs perfection of a security interest in collateral covered by the financing statement.
    
    (f)  A financing statement that includes a financing statement filed before the revision takes effect and a continuation statement filed after the revision takes effect is effective only to the extent that it satisfies the requirements of Subchapter E,  as revised, for an initial financing statement.
    
    (g)  Subsection (c)(2) does not apply to a financing statement that was filed before July 1, 2001, in the proper office in this state pursuant to Section [9.401](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.401), as that section existed immediately before July 1, 2001, and as to which the proper filing office was not changed pursuant to Section [9.501](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.501) of the revision.  The lapse date of such a financing statement is the day when the financing statement would have ceased to be effective under Section [9.403](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.403)(b), as that section existed immediately before July 1, 2001.  On timely filing of a continuation statement within six months before that lapse date, the effectiveness of the financing statement continues for another period of five years commencing on the lapse date, and succeeding continuation statements may be filed within six months before the expiration of the five-year period and each additional five-year period to continue the effectiveness of the financing statement.

    (2)  the pre-effective-date financing statement was filed in an office in another state or another office in this state;  and
    
    (3)  the initial financing statement satisfies Subsection (c).
    
    (b)  The filing of an initial financing statement under Subsection (a) continues the effectiveness of the pre-effective-date financing statement:

    (1)  satisfy the requirements of Subchapter E,  as revised, for an initial financing statement;
    
    (2)  identify the pre-effective-date financing statement by indicating the office in which the financing statement was filed and providing the dates of filing and file numbers, if any, of the financing statement and of the most recent continuation statement filed with respect to the financing statement;  and
    
    (3)  indicate that the pre-effective-date financing statement remains effective.

    (b)  After the revision takes effect, a person may add or delete collateral covered by, continue or terminate the effectiveness of, or otherwise amend the information provided in a pre-effective-date financing statement only in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in Subchapter C.  However, the effectiveness of a pre-effective-date financing statement also may be terminated in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the financing statement is filed.

    (3)  an initial financing statement that provides the information as amended and satisfies Section [9.706](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.706)(c) is filed in the office specified in Section [9.501](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.501).

    Sec. 9.805.  EFFECTIVENESS OF ACTION TAKEN BEFORE EFFECTIVE DATE.  (a)  The filing of a financing statement before the 2013 amendments take effect is effective to perfect a security interest to the extent the filing would satisfy the applicable requirements for perfection under this chapter, as amended by the 2013 amendments.
    
    (b)  The 2013 amendments do not render ineffective an effective financing statement that, before July 1, 2013, is filed and satisfies the applicable requirements for perfection under the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in this chapter as it existed before amendment.  However, except as otherwise provided in Subsections (c) and (d) and Section [9.806](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.806), the financing statement ceases to be effective:
    
    (1)  if the financing statement is filed in this state, at the time the financing statement would have ceased to be effective had the 2013 amendments not taken effect; or
    
    (2)  if the financing statement is filed in another jurisdiction, at the earlier of:
    
    (A)  the time the financing statement would have ceased to be effective under the law of that jurisdiction; or
    
    (B)  June 30, 2018.
    
    (c)  The filing of a continuation statement after the 2013 amendments take effect does not continue the effectiveness of the financing statement filed before July 1, 2013.  However, on the timely filing of a continuation statement after the 2013 amendments take effect and in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in this chapter, as amended by the 2013 amendments, the effectiveness of a financing statement filed in the same office in that jurisdiction before the 2013 amendments take effect continues for the period provided by the law of that jurisdiction.
    
    (d)  Subsection (b)(2)(B) applies to a financing statement that, before July 1, 2013, is filed against a transmitting utility and satisfies the applicable requirements for perfection under the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in this chapter as it existed before amendment, only to the extent that this chapter, as amended by the 2013 amendments, provides that the law of a jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction in which the financing statement is filed governs perfection of a security interest in collateral covered by the financing statement.
    
    (e)  A financing statement that includes a financing statement filed before the 2013 amendments take effect and a continuation statement filed after the 2013 amendments take effect is effective only to the extent that it satisfies the requirements of Subchapter E, as amended by the 2013 amendments, for an initial financing statement.  A financing statement that indicates that the debtor is a decedent's estate indicates that the collateral is being administered by a personal representative within the meaning of Section [9.503](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.503)(a)(2), as amended by the 2013 amendments.  A financing statement that indicates that the debtor is a trust or is a trustee acting with respect to property held in trust indicates that the collateral is held in a trust within the meaning of Section [9.503](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.503)(a)(3), as amended by the 2013 amendments.

(a)  The filing of an initial financing statement in the office specified in Section [9.501](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.501) continues the effectiveness of a financing statement filed before July 1, 2013, if:

    (2)  identify the pre-effective-date financing statement by indicating the office in which the financing statement was filed and providing the dates of filing and file numbers, if any, of the financing statement and of the most recent continuation statement filed with respect to the financing statement; and
    
    (3)  indicate that the pre-effective-date financing statement remains effective.

    (2)  an amendment is filed in the office specified in Section [9.501](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.501) concurrently with, or after the filing in that office of, an initial financing statement that satisfies Section [9.806](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.806)(c); or
    
    (3)  an initial financing statement that provides the information as amended and satisfies Section [9.806](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.806)(c) is filed in the office specified in Section [9.501](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9.501).
