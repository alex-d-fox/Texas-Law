    SUBCHAPTER B. THE ASSIGNMENT
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 23.08.  FORM AND CONTENT OF ASSIGNMENT.  (a)  For an assignment to be valid,
    
    (1)  the assigning debtor must make the assignment in writing;  and
    
    (2)  it must be proved or acknowledged and recorded in the manner provided by law for the conveyance of real estate.
    
    (b)  The assigning debtor shall attach to his assignment an inventory containing the following information:
    
    (1)  a list naming each creditor of the assigning debtor;
    
    (2)  the resident address, if known, of each creditor;
    
    (3)  the amount owed each creditor and the type of debt;
    
    (4)  the consideration for the debt and the place where the debt arose;
    
    (5)  a description of each existing judgment or security for the payment of the debt;
    
    (6)  a schedule of all the assigning debtor's real and personal estate at the date of the assignment;
    
    (7)  a description of
    
    (A)  each encumbrance on the real and personal estate;  and
    
    (B)  each voucher and security relating to the estate;  and

    Sec. 23.09.  FRAUD DOES NOT DEFEAT ASSIGNMENT.  (a)  An assignment is not affected and a consenting creditor is not deprived of his proportionate share of the assigned estate by the fraudulent act or intent of the assigning debtor or assignee.  A consenting creditor is a proper party to a suit filed to enforce a right under an assignment, or to protect an interest in an assigned estate.
    
    (b)  Except as to an innocent purchaser for value, a transfer of property made in contemplation of an assignment with an intent to defeat, delay, defraud, or give preference to a creditor is void and the property passes under the assignment rather than by the transfer.
    
    (c)  An assignee may sue to recover property transferred with an intent described in Subsection (b) of this section, and when the property is recovered, the assignee shall apply it for the benefit of the assigning debtor's creditors along with property belonging to the assigned estate already in the assignee's possession.  If an assignee neglects or refuses to sue to recover property transferred with an intent described in Subsection (b) of this section, a creditor, after securing the assignee against cost or liability, may sue in the assignee's name to recover the property.
