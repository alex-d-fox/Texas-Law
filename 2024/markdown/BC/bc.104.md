    Sec. 104.002.  PROHIBITED FEES, CHARGES, AND DISCOUNTS.  (a)  For purposes of this section, wholesale price is computed by adding to the invoice price or purchase price per gallon charged to a franchisee who buys motor fuel any excise tax paid by the buyer and any reasonable freight charges paid by the buyer, and subtracting that portion of any refund, rebate, or subsidy not designed to offset the fee, charge, or discount described by this section.
    
    (b)  Except as provided by Subsection (c), a franchisor may not require a franchisee to pay to the franchisor a fee, charge, or discount for:
    
    (1)  honoring a credit card issued by the franchisor; or
    
    (2)  submitting to the franchisor, for payment or credit to the franchisee's account, documents or other evidence of indebtedness of the holder of a credit card issued by the franchisor.
    
    (c)  A franchisor may require a franchisee to pay the fee, charge, or discount if the franchisor, in consideration of competitive prices in the relevant market, has adjusted the wholesale prices charged or rebates credited to franchisees for motor fuel by amounts that on average for franchisees in this state substantially offset the fee, charge, or discount.
