    (b)  Authority to Issue Demand.

    (c)  Contents of Demand.
    
    (1)  Each demand shall describe the nature of the activities that are the subject of the investigation and shall set forth each statute and section of that statute that may have been or may be violated as a result of such activities.

    (2)  Any demand for a product of discovery supercedes any inconsistent order, rule, or provision of law (other than this subchapter) preventing or restraining disclosure of such product of discovery;  provided, however, that voluntary disclosure of a product of discovery under this section does not constitute a waiver of any right or privilege, including any right or privilege which may be invoked to resist discovery of trial preparation materials, to which the person making the disclosure may be entitled.

    (C)  Any person compelled to appear under a demand for oral testimony under this section may be accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel.

    (3)  The attorney general may make available for inspection or prepare copies of documentary material, answers to interrogatories, or transcripts of oral testimony in his or her possession as he or she determines may be required for official use by any officer of the State of Texas or of the United States charged with the enforcement of the laws of the State of Texas or the United States;  provided that any material disclosed under this subsection may not be used for criminal law enforcement purposes.
    
    (4)  Upon request, the attorney general shall make available copies of documentary material, answers to interrogatories, and transcripts of oral testimony for inspection by the person who produced such material or information and, in the case of a product of discovery, the person from whom the discovery was obtained or by any duly authorized representative of the person, including his or her counsel.
    
    (5)  Not later than 15 days prior to disclosing any documentary material or answers to written interrogatories designated as containing trade secrets or confidential information under this subsection, the attorney general shall notify the person who produced the material of the attorney general's intent to make such disclosure.  The person who produced the documentary material or answers to written interrogatories may petition a district court in any county of this state in which the person resides, does business, or maintains its principal office for a protective order limiting the terms under which the attorney general may disclose such trade secrets or confidential information.

A person who has been informed of an order issued by a court under this section compelling his or her testimony or production of material may not refuse to comply with the order on the basis of his or her privilege against self-incrimination.  A person who complies with the order may not be criminally prosecuted for or on account of any act, transaction, matter, or thing about which he or she is ordered to testify or produce unless the alleged offense is perjury or failure to comply with the order.  Failure to comply with the order may be punished by the court as contempt of the order.

    Sec. 15.16.  DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTION.

    (b)  Citation and all process in the suit shall be served on the attorney general, who shall represent the state.

    (1)  shall be strictly construed and may not be extended by implication to an action or fact not recited in the judgment;

    Sec. 15.20.  CIVIL SUITS BY THE STATE.  (a)  Suit to Collect Civil Fine.  The attorney general may file suit in district court in Travis County or in any county in the State of Texas in which any of the named defendants resides, does business, or maintains its principal office on behalf of the State of Texas to collect a civil fine from any person, other than a municipal corporation, whom the attorney general believes has violated any of the prohibitions in Subsection (a), (b), or (c) of Section 15.05 of this Act.  An individual or other person adjudged to have violated any of these prohibitions shall pay a fine to the state in an amount not to exceed:
    
    (1)  if an individual, $300,000; or
    
    (2)  if any other person:
    
    (A)  $3 million, if the lesser of the person's assets or market capitalization is less than $100 million;

In any such suit, the court shall apply the same principles as those generally applied by courts of equity in suits for injunctive relief against threatened conduct that would cause injury to business or property.  In any such suit in which the state substantially prevails on the merits, the state shall be entitled to recover the cost of suit.
    
    Upon finding a violation of the prohibition against acquiring the stock, share capital, or assets of a person in Subsection (d) of Section 15.05 of this Act, the court shall, upon further finding that no other remedy will eliminate the lessening of competition, order the divestiture or other disposition of the stock, share capital, or assets and shall prescribe a reasonable time, manner, and degree of the divestiture or other disposition.
    
    (c)  No suit filed under Subsection (a) or (b) of this section may be transferred to another county except on order of the court.
    
    (d)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the constitutional or common law authority of the attorney general to bring actions under state and federal law.

    (2)  Any person or governmental entity who obtains a judgment for damages under 15 U.S.C.

In any such suit, the court shall apply the same principles as those generally applied by courts of equity in suits for injunctive relief against threatened conduct that would cause injury to business or property.  In any such suit in which the plaintiff substantially prevails on the merits, the plaintiff shall be entitled to recover the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee based on the fair market value of the attorney services used.
    
    (c)  Copies of Complaints to Attorney General.  Any person or governmental entity filing suit under this section shall mail a copy of the complaint to the Attorney General of Texas.  The attorney general as representative of the public may intervene in the action by filing a notice of intervention with the court before which the action is pending and serving copies of the notice on all parties to the action.  The penalty for failure to comply with this subsection shall be a monetary fine not in excess of $200.  The attorney general may file suit to recover the fine on behalf of the state in the district court in which the private suit has been brought.

    Sec. 15.50.  CRITERIA FOR ENFORCEABILITY OF COVENANTS NOT TO COMPETE.  (a)  Notwithstanding Section [15.05](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=15.05) of this code, and subject to any applicable provision of Subsection (b), a covenant not to compete is enforceable if it is ancillary to or part of an otherwise enforceable agreement at the time the agreement is made to the extent that it contains limitations as to time, geographical area, and scope of activity to be restrained that are reasonable and do not impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill or other business interest of the promisee.
    
    (b)  A covenant not to compete relating to the practice of medicine is enforceable against a person licensed as a physician by the Texas Medical Board if such covenant complies with the following requirements:
    
    (1)  the covenant must:
    
    (A)  not deny the physician access to a list of his patients whom he had seen or treated within one year of termination of the contract or employment;
    
    (B)  provide access to medical records of the physician's patients upon authorization of the patient and any copies of medical records for a reasonable fee as established by the Texas Medical Board under Section [159.008](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=159.008), Occupations Code; and
    
    (C)  provide that any access to a list of patients or to patients' medical records after termination of the contract or employment shall not require such list or records to be provided in a format different than that by which such records are maintained except by mutual consent of the parties to the contract;
    
    (2)  the covenant must provide for a buy out of the covenant by the physician at a reasonable price or, at the option of either party, as determined by a mutually agreed upon arbitrator or, in the case of an inability to agree, an arbitrator of the court whose decision shall be binding on the parties; and
    
    (3)  the covenant must provide that the physician will not be prohibited from providing continuing care and treatment to a specific patient or patients during the course of an acute illness even after the contract or employment has been terminated.
    
    (c)  Subsection (b) does not apply to a physician's business ownership interest in a licensed hospital or licensed ambulatory surgical center.

    Sec. 15.51.  PROCEDURES AND REMEDIES IN ACTIONS TO ENFORCE COVENANTS NOT TO COMPETE.  (a)  Except as provided in Subsection (c) of this section, a court may award the promisee under a covenant not to compete damages, injunctive relief, or both damages and injunctive relief for a breach by the promisor of the covenant.
    
    (b)  If the primary purpose of the agreement to which the covenant is ancillary is to obligate the promisor to render personal services, for a term or at will, the promisee has the burden of establishing that the covenant meets the criteria specified by Section [15.50](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=15.50) of this code.  If the agreement has a different primary purpose, the promisor has the burden of establishing that the covenant does not meet those criteria.  For the purposes of this subsection, the "burden of establishing" a fact means the burden of persuading the triers of fact that the existence of the fact is more probable than its nonexistence.
    
    (c)  If the covenant is found to be ancillary to or part of an otherwise enforceable agreement but contains limitations as to time, geographical area, or scope of activity to be restrained that are not reasonable and impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill or other business interest of the promisee, the court shall reform the covenant to the extent necessary to cause the limitations contained in the covenant as to time, geographical area, and scope of activity to be restrained to be reasonable and to impose a restraint that is not greater than necessary to protect the goodwill or other business interest of the promisee and enforce the covenant as reformed, except that the court may not award the promisee damages for a breach of the covenant before its reformation and the relief granted to the promisee shall be limited to injunctive relief.  If the primary purpose of the agreement to which the covenant is ancillary is to obligate the promisor to render personal services, the promisor establishes that the promisee knew at the time of the execution of the agreement that the covenant did not contain limitations as to time, geographical area, and scope of activity to be restrained that were reasonable and the limitations imposed a greater restraint than necessary to protect the goodwill or other business interest of the promisee, and the promisee sought to enforce the covenant to a greater extent than was necessary to protect the goodwill or other business interest of the promisee, the court may award the promisor the costs, including reasonable attorney's fees, actually and reasonably incurred by the promisor in defending the action to enforce the covenant.
