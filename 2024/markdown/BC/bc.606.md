    (c)  A military service member who provides to a service provider a written notice of suspension or termination of a service described by Subsection (a) shall also provide to the service provider proof of the service member's official orders calling the service member to active duty military service:
    
    (1)  at the time the service member provides the written notice; or
    
    (2)  not later than the 90th day after the date on which the service member provides the written notice, if military necessity or circumstances make the provision of proof at the time written notice is provided unreasonable or impossible.
    
    (d)  A service provider shall suspend or terminate the service provided by the service provider to a military service member on:
    
    (1)  the same business day the service provider receives a written notice of suspension or termination under this section; or

    (e)  The suspension or termination of the service is effective on the applicable suspension or termination date prescribed by Subsection (d).  Except as provided by Subsection (f), a military service member is not liable for the payment of any service suspended or terminated under this section after the effective date of the suspension or termination unless and until the service member reinstates the service as provided by Section [606.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=606.003).
