    Sec. 523.001.  EXTENSION OF CREDIT TO VICTIM OF IDENTITY THEFT.  (a)  In this section, "victim of identity theft" means an individual who has filed a criminal complaint alleging the commission of an offense under Section [32.51](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=32.51), Penal Code, other than a person who is convicted of an offense under Section [37.08](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=37.08), Penal Code, with respect to that complaint.
    
    (b)  A person who has been notified that an individual has been the victim of identity theft may not deny the individual an extension of credit, including a loan, in the individual's name or restrict or limit the credit extended solely because the individual has been a victim of identity theft.  This subsection does not prohibit a person from denying an individual an extension of credit for a reason other than the individual's having been a victim of identity theft, including by reason of the individual's lack of capacity to contract.
    
    (c)  A license issued under Subtitle B, Title 4, Finance Code, that is held by a person who violates this section is subject to revocation or suspension under that subtitle.
