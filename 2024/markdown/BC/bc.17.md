    Sec. 17.461.  PYRAMID PROMOTIONAL SCHEME.  (a)  In this section:
    
    (1)  "Compensation" means payment of money, a financial benefit, or another thing of value.  The term does not include payment based on sale of a product to a person, including a participant, who purchases the product for actual use or consumption.
    
    (2)  "Consideration" means the payment of cash or the purchase of a product.  The term does not include:
    
    (A)  a purchase of a product furnished at cost to be used in making a sale and not for resale;
    
    (B)  a purchase of a product subject to a repurchase agreement that complies with Subsection (b);  or
    
    (C)  time and effort spent in pursuit of a sale or in a recruiting activity.
    
    (3)  "Participate" means to contribute money into a pyramid promotional scheme without promoting, organizing, or operating the scheme.
    
    (4)  "Product" means a good, a service, or intangible property of any kind.
    
    (5)  "Promoting a pyramid promotional scheme" means:
    
    (A)  inducing or attempting to induce one or more other persons to participate in a pyramid promotional scheme;  or
    
    (B)  assisting another person in inducing or attempting to induce one or more other persons to participate in a pyramid promotional scheme, including by providing references.
    
    (6)  "Pyramid promotional scheme" means a plan or operation by which a person gives consideration for the opportunity to receive compensation that is derived primarily from a person's introduction of other persons to participate in the plan or operation rather than from the sale of a product by a person introduced into the plan or operation.
    
    (b)  To qualify as a repurchase agreement for the purposes of Subsection (a)(2)(B), an agreement must be an enforceable agreement by the seller to repurchase, on written request of the purchaser and not later than the first anniversary of the purchaser's date of purchase, all unencumbered products that are in an unused, commercially resalable condition at a price not less than 90 percent of the amount actually paid by the purchaser for the products being returned, less any consideration received by the purchaser for purchase of the products being returned.  A product that is no longer marketed by the seller is considered resalable if the product is otherwise in an unused, commercially resalable condition and is returned to the seller not later than the first anniversary of the purchaser's date of purchase, except that the product is not considered resalable if before the purchaser purchased the product it was clearly disclosed to the purchaser that the product was sold as a nonreturnable, discontinued, seasonal, or special promotion item.
    
    (c)  A person commits an offense if the person contrives, prepares, establishes, operates, advertises, sells, or promotes a pyramid promotional scheme.  An offense under this subsection is a state jail felony.
    
    (d)  It is not a defense to prosecution for an offense under this section that the pyramid promotional scheme involved both a franchise to sell a product and the authority to sell additional franchises if the emphasis of the scheme is on the sale of additional franchises.

    (2)  on an Internet website; or
    
    (3)  in a print advertisement.
    
    (b)  A person is considered to misrepresent the geographical location of a business for purposes of Subsection (a) if the name of the business indicates that the business is located in a geographical area and:

    (d)  This section does not apply to:
    
    (1)  a publisher of a telephone directory or other publication or a provider of a directory assistance service publishing or providing information about another business;
    
    (2)  an Internet website that aggregates and provides information about other businesses;
    
    (3)  an owner or publisher of a print medium providing information about other businesses;
    
    (4)  an Internet service provider; or
    
    (5)  an Internet service that displays or distributes advertisements for other businesses.

    (1)  "Emergency care" means health care services provided in an emergency facility to evaluate and stabilize medical conditions of a recent onset and severity, including severe pain, that would lead a prudent layperson possessing an average knowledge of medicine and health to believe that the individual's condition, sickness, or injury is of such a nature that failure to get immediate medical care could:
    
    (A)  place the individual's health in serious jeopardy;
    
    (B)  result in serious impairment to bodily functions;
    
    (C)  result in serious dysfunction of a bodily organ or part;
    
    (D)  result in serious disfigurement; or
    
    (E)  for a pregnant woman, result in serious jeopardy to the health of the fetus.
    
    (2)  "Emergency facility":
    
    (A)  means:
    
    (i)  a freestanding emergency medical care facility licensed under Chapter [254](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=254), Health and Safety Code; or
    
    (ii)  a hospital that does not meet the conditions of participation for certification under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. Section 1395 et seq.); and
    
    (B)  does not include a hospital that:

    (c)  The consumer protection division may not bring an action under Section [17.47](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=17.47) for an act or practice described by Subsection (b) if the price alleged to be unconscionable is less than 200 percent of the average charge for the same or substantially similar care provided to other individuals by emergency rooms of hospitals located in the same county or nearest county in which the emergency facility is located, as applicable, according to data collected by the Department of State Health Services under Chapter [108](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=108), Health and Safety Code, and made available to the division, except as provided by Subsection (d).  The consumer protection division may not use data that includes prices for care provided in an urgent care setting or physician practice to establish the division's authority to investigate and pursue an action under this subchapter.
    
    (d)  If the attorney general determines that the consumer protection division is unable to obtain the charge data described by Subsection (c), the attorney general may adopt rules designating another source of hospital charge data for use by the division in establishing the average charge for emergency care or other care provided by hospital emergency rooms for purposes of Subsection (c).
    
    (e)  In an action brought under Section [17.47](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=17.47) to enforce this section, the consumer protection division may request, and the trier of fact may award the recovery of:
    
    (1)  reasonable attorney's fees and court costs; and
    
    (2)  the reasonable expenses incurred by the division in obtaining any remedy available under Section [17.47](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=17.47), including the cost of investigation, witness fees, and deposition expenses.

    Sec. 17.47.  RESTRAINING ORDERS.  (a)  Whenever the consumer protection division has reason to believe that any person is engaging in, has engaged in, or is about to engage in any act or practice declared to be unlawful by this subchapter, and that proceedings would be in the public interest, the division may bring an action in the name of the state against the person to restrain by temporary restraining order, temporary injunction, or permanent injunction the use of such method, act, or practice. 
    
    Nothing herein shall require the consumer protection division to notify such person that court action is or may be under consideration.  Provided, however, the consumer protection division shall, at least seven days prior to instituting such court action, contact such person to inform him in general of the alleged unlawful conduct.  Cessation of unlawful conduct after such prior contact shall not render such court action moot under any circumstances, and such injunctive relief shall lie even if such person has ceased such unlawful conduct after such prior contact.  Such prior contact shall not be required if, in the opinion of the consumer protection division, there is good cause to believe that such person would evade service of process if prior contact were made or that such person would destroy relevant records if prior contact were made, or that such an emergency exists that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage would occur as a result of such delay in obtaining a temporary restraining order.
    
    (b)  An action brought under Subsection (a) of this section which alleges a claim to relief under this section may be commenced in the district court of the county in which the person against whom it is brought resides, has his principal place of business, has done business, or in the district court of the county where the transaction occurred, or, on the consent of the parties, in a district court of Travis County.  The court may issue temporary restraining orders, temporary or permanent injunctions to restrain and prevent violations of this subchapter and such injunctive relief shall be issued without bond.
    
    (c)  In addition to the request for a temporary restraining order, or permanent injunction in a proceeding brought under Subsection (a) of this section, the consumer protection division may request, and the trier of fact may award, a civil penalty to be paid to the state in an amount of:
    
    (1)  not more than $10,000 per violation; and
    
    (2)  if the act or practice that is the subject of the proceeding was calculated to acquire or deprive money or other property from a consumer who was 65 years of age or older when the act or practice occurred, an additional amount of not more than $250,000.
    
    (d)  The court may make such additional orders or judgments as are necessary to compensate identifiable persons for actual damages or to restore money or property, real or personal, which may have been acquired by means of any unlawful act or practice.  Damages may not include any damages incurred beyond a point two years prior to the institution of the action by the consumer protection division.  Orders of the court may also include the appointment of a receiver or a sequestration of assets if a person who has been ordered by a court to make restitution under this section has failed to do so within three months after the order to make restitution has become final and nonappealable.
    
    (e)  Any person who violates the terms of an injunction under this section shall forfeit and pay to the state a civil penalty of not more than $10,000 per violation, not to exceed $50,000.  In determining whether or not an injunction has been violated the court shall take into consideration the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to insure compliance with the injunction.  For the purposes of this section, the district court issuing the injunction shall retain jurisdiction, and the cause shall be continued, and in these cases, the consumer protection division, or the district or county attorney with prior notice to the consumer protection division, acting in the name of the state, may petition for recovery of civil penalties under this section.
    
    (f)  An order of the court awarding civil penalties under Subsection (e) of this section applies only to violations of the injunction incurred prior to the awarding of the penalty order.  Second or subsequent violations of an injunction issued under this section are subject to the same penalties set out in Subsection (e) of this section.
    
    (g)  In determining the amount of penalty imposed under Subsection (c), the trier of fact shall consider:
    
    (1)  the seriousness of the violation, including the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of any prohibited act or practice;
    
    (2)  the history of previous violations;
    
    (3)  the amount necessary to deter future violations;
    
    (4)  the economic effect on the person against whom the penalty is to be assessed;
    
    (5)  knowledge of the illegality of the act or practice;  and
    
    (6)  any other matter that justice may require.
    
    (h)  In bringing or participating in an action under this subchapter, the consumer protection division acts in the name of the state and does not establish an attorney-client relationship with another person, including a person to whom the consumer protection division requests that the court award relief.

    (g)  Nothing in this subchapter shall apply to a cause of action arising from a transaction, a project, or a set of transactions relating to the same project, involving total consideration by the consumer of more than $500,000, other than a cause of action involving a consumer's residence.

Costs and fees of such receivership or other relief shall be assessed against the defendant.
    
    (c)  On a finding by the court that an action under this section was groundless in fact or law or brought in bad faith, or brought for the purpose of harassment, the court shall award to the defendant reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees and court costs.
    
    (d)  Each consumer who prevails shall be awarded court costs and reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees.

    (2)  additional damages under Subsection (b).
    
    (g)  Chapter [41](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=41), Civil Practice and Remedies Code, does not apply to a cause of action brought under this subchapter.
    
    (h)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, if a claimant is granted the right to bring a cause of action under this subchapter by another law, the claimant is not limited to recovery of economic damages only, but may recover any actual damages incurred by the claimant, without regard to whether the conduct of the defendant was committed intentionally.  For the purpose of the recovery of damages for a cause of action described by this subsection only, a reference in this subchapter to economic damages means actual damages.  In applying Subsection (b)(1) to an award of damages under this subsection, the trier of fact is authorized to award a total of not more than three times actual damages, in accordance with that subsection.

    (1)  written information relating to the particular goods or service in question obtained from official government records if the written information was false or inaccurate and the defendant did not know and could not reasonably have known of the falsity or inaccuracy of the information;
    
    (2)  written information relating to the particular goods or service in question obtained from another source if the information was false or inaccurate and the defendant did not know and could not reasonably have known of the falsity or inaccuracy of the information;  or
    
    (3)  written information concerning a test required or prescribed by a government agency if the information from the test was false or inaccurate and the defendant did not know and could not reasonably have known of the falsity or inaccuracy of the information.

    (d)  In an action brought under Section [17.50](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=17.50) of this subchapter, it is a defense to a cause of action if the defendant proves that he received notice from the consumer advising the defendant of the nature of the consumer's specific complaint and of the amount of economic damages, damages for mental anguish, and expenses, including attorneys' fees, if any, reasonably incurred by the consumer in asserting the claim against the defendant, and that within 30 days after the day on which the defendant received the notice the defendant tendered to the consumer:
    
    (1)  the amount of economic damages and damages for mental anguish claimed;  and

The assurance shall be in writing and shall be filed with and subject to the approval of the district court in the county in which the alleged violator resides or does business or in the district court of Travis County.
    
    (b)  The acceptance of an assurance of voluntary compliance may be conditioned on the stipulation that the person in violation of this subchapter restore to any person in interest any money or property, real or personal, which may have been acquired by means of acts or practices which violate this subchapter.
    
    (c)  An assurance of voluntary compliance shall not be considered an admission of prior violation of this subchapter.  However, unless an assurance has been rescinded by agreement of the parties or voided by a court for good cause, subsequent failure to comply with the terms of an assurance is prima facie evidence of a violation of this subchapter.
    
    (d)  Matters closed by the filing of an assurance of voluntary compliance may be reopened at any time.  Assurances of voluntary compliance shall in no way affect individual rights of action under this subchapter, except that the rights of individuals with regard to money or property received pursuant to a stipulation in the voluntary compliance under Subsection (b) of this section are governed by the terms of the voluntary compliance.
