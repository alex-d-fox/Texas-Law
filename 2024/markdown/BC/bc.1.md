    (1)  has actual knowledge of it;
    
    (2)  has received a notice or notification of it;  or
    
    (3)  from all the facts and circumstances known to the person at the time in question, has reason to know that it exists.

    (d)  A person "notifies" or "gives" a notice or notification to another person by taking such steps as may be reasonably required to inform the other person in ordinary course, whether or not the other person actually comes to know of it.

    (f)  Notice, knowledge, or a notice or notification received by an organization is effective for a particular transaction from the time it is brought to the attention of the individual conducting that transaction and, in any event, from the time it would have been brought to the individual's attention if the organization had exercised due diligence.  An organization exercises due diligence if it maintains reasonable routines for communicating significant information to the person conducting the transaction and there is reasonable compliance with the routines.  Due diligence does not require an individual acting for the organization to communicate information unless the communication is part of the individual's regular duties or the individual has reason to know of the transaction and that the transaction would be materially affected by the information.

    Sec. 1.203.  LEASE DISTINGUISHED FROM SECURITY INTEREST.  (a)  Whether a transaction in the form of a lease creates a lease or security interest is determined by the facts of each case.
    
    (b)  A transaction in the form of a lease creates a security interest if the consideration that the lessee is to pay the lessor for the right to possession and use of the goods is an obligation for the term of the lease and is not subject to termination by the lessee, and:
    
    (1)  the original term of the lease is equal to or greater than the remaining economic life of the goods;
    
    (2)  the lessee is bound to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of the goods or is bound to become the owner of the goods;
    
    (3)  the lessee has an option to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of the goods for no additional consideration or for nominal additional consideration upon compliance with the lease agreement;  or
    
    (4)  the lessee has an option to become the owner of the goods for no additional consideration or for nominal additional consideration upon compliance with the lease agreement.
    
    (c)  A transaction in the form of a lease does not create a security interest merely because:
    
    (1)  the present value of the consideration the lessee is obligated to pay the lessor for the right to possession and use of the goods is substantially equal to or is greater than the fair market value of the goods at the time the lease is entered into;
    
    (2)  the lessee assumes risk of loss of the goods;
    
    (3)  the lessee agrees to pay, with respect to the goods, taxes, insurance, filing, recording, or registration fees, or service or maintenance costs;
    
    (4)  the lessee has an option to renew the lease or to become the owner of the goods;
    
    (5)  the lessee has an option to renew the lease for a fixed rent that is equal to or greater than the reasonably predictable fair market rent for the use of the goods for the term of the renewal at the time the option is to be performed;  or
    
    (6)  the lessee has an option to become the owner of the goods for a fixed price that is equal to or greater than the reasonably predictable fair market value of the goods at the time the option is to be performed.
    
    (d)  Additional consideration is nominal if it is less than the lessee's reasonably predictable cost of performing under the lease agreement if the option is not exercised.  Additional consideration is not nominal if:
    
    (1)  when the option to renew the lease is granted to the lessee, the rent is stated to be the fair market rent for the use of the goods for the term of the renewal determined at the time the option is to be performed;  or
    
    (2)  when the option to become the owner of the goods is granted to the lessee, the price is stated to be the fair market value of the goods determined at the time the option is to be performed.
    
    (e)  The "remaining economic life of the goods" and "reasonably predictable" fair market rent, fair market value, or cost of performing under the lease agreement must be determined with reference to the facts and circumstances at the time the transaction is entered into.

    Sec. 1.301.  TERRITORIAL APPLICATION OF THE TITLE;  PARTIES' POWER TO CHOOSE APPLICABLE LAW.  (a)  Except as provided hereafter in this section, when a transaction bears a reasonable relation to this state and also to another state or nation the parties may agree that the law either of this state or of such other state or nation shall govern their rights and duties.  Failing such agreement this title applies to transactions bearing an appropriate relation to this state.
    
    (b)  Where one of the following provisions of this title specifies the applicable law, that provision governs and a contrary agreement is effective only to the extent permitted by the law (including the conflict of laws rules) so specified:
    
    Rights of creditors against sold goods.  Section [2.402](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=2.402).

    Sec. 1.302.  VARIATION BY AGREEMENT.  (a)  Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (b) or elsewhere in this title, the effect of provisions of this title may be varied by agreement.
    
    (b)  The obligations of good faith, diligence, reasonableness, and care prescribed by this title may not be disclaimed by agreement.  The parties, by agreement, may determine the standards by which the performance of those obligations is to be measured if those standards are not manifestly unreasonable.  Whenever this title requires an action to be taken within a reasonable time, a time that is not manifestly unreasonable may be fixed by agreement.
    
    (c)  The presence in certain provisions of this title of the phrase "unless otherwise agreed," or words of similar import, does not imply that the effect of other provisions may not be varied by agreement under this section.

    Sec. 1.303.  COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, COURSE OF DEALING, AND USAGE OF TRADE.  (a)  A "course of performance" is a sequence of conduct between the parties to a particular transaction that exists if:
    
    (1)  the agreement of the parties with respect to the transaction involves repeated occasions for performance by a party;  and
    
    (2)  the other party, with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity for objection to it, accepts the performance or acquiesces in it without objection.
    
    (b)  A course of dealing is a sequence of conduct concerning previous transactions between the parties to a particular transaction that is fairly to be regarded as establishing a common basis of understanding for interpreting their expressions and other conduct.
    
    (c)  A "usage of trade" is any practice or method of dealing having such regularity of observance in a place, vocation, or trade as to justify an expectation that it will be observed with respect to the transaction in question.  The existence and scope of such a usage must be proved as facts.  If it is established that such a usage is embodied in a trade code or similar record, the interpretation of the record is a question of law.
    
    (d)  A course of performance or course of dealing between the parties or usage of trade in the vocation or trade in which they are engaged or of which they are or should be aware is relevant in ascertaining the meaning of the parties' agreement, may give particular meaning to specific terms of the agreement, and may supplement or qualify the terms of the agreement.  A usage of trade applicable in the place in which part of the performance under the agreement is to occur may be so utilized as to that part of the performance.
    
    (e)  Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (f), the express terms of an agreement and any applicable course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade must be construed whenever reasonable as consistent with each other.  If such a construction is unreasonable:
    
    (1)  express terms prevail over course of performance, course of dealing, and usage of trade;
    
    (2)  course of performance prevails over course of dealing and usage of trade;  and
    
    (3)  course of dealing prevails over usage of trade.
    
    (f)  Subject to Section [2.209](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=2.209), a course of performance is relevant to show a waiver or modification of any term inconsistent with the course of performance.
    
    (g)  Evidence of a relevant usage of trade offered by one party is not admissible unless that party has given the other party notice that the court finds sufficient to prevent unfair surprise to the other party.

    Sec. 1.305.  REMEDIES TO BE LIBERALLY ADMINISTERED.  (a)  The remedies provided by this title must be liberally administered to the end that the aggrieved party may be put in as good a position as if the other party had fully performed but neither consequential or special damages nor penal damages may be had except as specifically provided in this title or by other rule of law.
    
    (b)  Any right or obligation declared by this title is enforceable by action unless the provision declaring it specifies a different and limited effect.

    Sec. 1.307.  PRIMA FACIE EVIDENCE BY THIRD-PARTY DOCUMENTS.  A document in due form purporting to be a bill of lading, policy or certificate of insurance, official weigher's or inspector's certificate, consular invoice, or any other document authorized or required by the contract to be issued by a third party is prima facie evidence of its own authenticity and genuineness and of the facts stated in the document by the third party.

    Sec. 1.308.  PERFORMANCE OR ACCEPTANCE UNDER RESERVATION OF RIGHTS.  (a)  A party that with explicit reservation of rights performs or promises performance or assents to performance in a manner demanded or offered by the other party does not thereby prejudice the rights reserved.  Such words as "without prejudice," "under protest," or the like are sufficient.
    
    (b)  Subsection (a) does not apply to an accord and satisfaction.

    Sec. 1.309.  OPTION TO ACCELERATE AT WILL.  A term providing that one party or that party's successor in interest may accelerate payment or performance or require collateral or additional collateral "at will" or when the party "deems itself insecure," or words of similar import, means that the party has power to do so only if that party in good faith believes that the prospect of payment or performance is impaired.  The burden of establishing lack of good faith is on the party against which the power has been exercised.

    Sec. 1.310.  SUBORDINATED OBLIGATIONS.  An obligation may be issued as subordinated to performance of another obligation of the person obligated, or a creditor may subordinate its right to performance of an obligation by agreement with either the person obligated or another creditor of the person obligated.  Subordination does not create a security interest as against either the common debtor or a subordinated creditor.
