    (b)  An assistant employed by a blind person licensed by the commission must be approved by the commission, and the deliberate refusal of a blind licensee to comply with this section constitutes grounds for the revocation of the person's license.
    
    
    
    
    Transferred, redesignated and amended from Human Resources Code, Chapter 94 by Acts 2015, 84th Leg., R.S., Ch. 1138 (S.B. [208](http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/84R/billtext/html/SB00208F.HTM)), Sec. 28, eff. September 1, 2015.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 355.010.  COMPETING VENDING MACHINES.  (a)  If the commission and an agency agree to the installation and operation of an additional vending facility or vending machine on property that already has a commission-sponsored vending facility, no additional permit or license is required.  However, the installation of a competing vending facility consisting of vending machines or other coin-operated devices must be authorized by the commission.  The commission's authorization must be made with a view toward providing the greatest economic benefits for blind persons consonant with supplying the additional services required at the building.
    
    (b)  State agencies shall cooperate and negotiate in good faith to accomplish the purposes of this chapter.
    
    (c)  Individuals with disabilities who operate vending facilities on state property are entitled to receive all commissions from vending machines installed on the same property.  If two or more vending facilities are operated by individuals with disabilities in a building in which vending machines are installed, the commission shall divide the commissions from the vending machines among the operators with disabilities in a manner that will achieve equity and equality in the incomes of those operators.  If the commission has decided not to locate a vending facility in a building, the agency to whom a general permit has been issued shall determine the assignment of the commissions from vending machines installed in the building.

    Sec. 355.011.  VENDING FACILITY EQUIPMENT AND STOCK.  (a)  The commission may supply a blind vending facility operator with equipment and initial stock necessary for the operator to begin business.
    
    (b)  The commission shall collect and set aside from the proceeds of the operation of its vending facilities enough money:
    
    (1)  to insure a sufficient amount of initial stock for the facilities and for their proper maintenance;
    
    (2)  to pay the costs of supervision and other expenses incidental to the operation of the facilities; and
    
    (3)  to pay other program costs to the extent necessary to assure fair and equal treatment of the blind persons licensed to operate the facilities and to the extent allowed under federal programs that provide financial support to the commission.
    
    (c)  Except for purchasing and installing original equipment, the operation of commission-sponsored vending facilities must be as self-supporting and self-sustaining as possible.  To achieve this end, the commission shall periodically review and, when necessary, revise its schedules for collecting and setting aside money from the proceeds of its vending facilities.
