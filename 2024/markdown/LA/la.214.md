    (d)  In considering evidence presented by a debtor under Subsection (c), the commission may determine only whether the debtor has demonstrated that the debt is not subject to recovery through the program so that the commission is able to minimize erroneous offsets.  The commission may not review the initial determination establishing the debtor's liability.
    
    (e)  The commission shall assess against the debtor the cost of any administrative fee charged by the United States Department of the Treasury for each offset.  The commission may add the assessed amount to the covered unemployment compensation debt that is offset under the program.
