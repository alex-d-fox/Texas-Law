    Sec. 413.011.  REIMBURSEMENT POLICIES AND GUIDELINES; TREATMENT GUIDELINES AND PROTOCOLS.  (a)  The commissioner shall adopt health care reimbursement policies and guidelines that reflect the standardized reimbursement structures found in other health care delivery systems with minimal modifications to those reimbursement methodologies as necessary to meet occupational injury requirements.  To achieve standardization, the commissioner shall adopt the most current reimbursement methodologies, models, and values or weights used by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, including applicable payment policies relating to coding, billing, and reporting, and may modify documentation requirements as necessary to meet the requirements of Section [413.053](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=413.053).
    
    (b)  In determining the appropriate fees, the commissioner shall also develop one or more conversion factors or other payment adjustment factors taking into account economic indicators in health care and the requirements of Subsection (d).  The commissioner shall also provide for reasonable fees for the evaluation and management of care as required by Section [408.025](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=408.025)(c) and commissioner rules.  This section does not adopt the Medicare fee schedule, and the commissioner may not adopt conversion factors or other payment adjustment factors based solely on those factors as developed by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
    
    (c)  This section may not be interpreted in a manner that would discriminate in the amount or method of payment or reimbursement for services in a manner prohibited by Section [1451.104](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1451.104), Insurance Code, or as restricting the ability of chiropractors to serve as treating doctors as authorized by this subtitle.  The commissioner shall also develop guidelines relating to fees charged or paid for providing expert testimony relating to an issue arising under this subtitle.
    
    (d)  Fee guidelines must be fair and reasonable and designed to ensure the quality of medical care and to achieve effective medical cost control.  The guidelines may not provide for payment of a fee in excess of the fee charged for similar treatment of an injured individual of an equivalent standard of living and paid by that individual or by someone acting on that individual's behalf.  The commissioner shall consider the increased security of payment afforded by this subtitle in establishing the fee guidelines.
    
    (d-1)  Expired.
    
    (d-2)  Expired.
    
    (d-3)  Expired.
    
    (d-4)  Notwithstanding this section or any other provision of this title, an insurance carrier, an insurance carrier's authorized agent, or a network certified under Chapter [1305](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1305), Insurance Code, arranging for non-network services or out-of-network services under Section [1305.006](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1305.006), Insurance Code, may continue to contract with a health care provider to secure health care for an injured employee for fees that exceed the fees adopted by the division under this section.
    
    (d-5)  The commissioner and the commissioner of insurance may adopt rules as necessary to implement this section.
    
    (d-6)  Expired.
    
    (e)  The commissioner by rule shall adopt treatment guidelines and return-to-work guidelines and may adopt individual treatment protocols.  Treatment guidelines and protocols must be evidence-based, scientifically valid, and outcome-focused and designed to reduce excessive or inappropriate medical care while safeguarding necessary medical care.  Treatment may not be denied solely on the basis that the treatment for the compensable injury in question is not specifically addressed by the treatment guidelines.
    
    (f)  In addition to complying with the requirements of Subsection (e), medical policies or guidelines adopted by the commissioner must be:
    
    (1)  designed to ensure the quality of medical care and to achieve effective medical cost control;
    
    (2)  designed to enhance a timely and appropriate return to work; and
    
    (3)  consistent with Sections [413.013](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=413.013), [413.020](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=413.020), [413.052](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=413.052), and [413.053](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=413.053).
    
    (g)  The commissioner may adopt rules relating to disability management that are designed to promote appropriate health care at the earliest opportunity after the injury to maximize injury healing and improve stay-at-work and return-to-work outcomes through appropriate management of work-related injuries or conditions.  The commissioner by rule may identify claims in which application of disability management activities is required and prescribe at what point in the claim process a treatment plan is required.  The determination may be based on any factor considered relevant by the commissioner.  Rules adopted under this subsection do not apply to claims subject to workers' compensation health care networks under Chapter [1305](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1305), Insurance Code.
    
    (h)  A dispute involving a treatment plan required under Subsection (g) may be appealed to an independent review organization in the manner described by Section [413.031](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=413.031).
    
    (i)  The division shall examine whether injured employees have reasonable access to surgically implanted, inserted, or otherwise applied devices or tissues and investigate whether reimbursement rates or any other barriers exist that reduce the ability of an injured employee to access those medical needs.  The division shall recommend to the legislature any statutory changes necessary to ensure appropriate access to those medical needs.

(a)  An insurance carrier shall, with the agreement of a participating employer, provide the employer with return-to-work coordination services on an ongoing basis as necessary to facilitate an employee's return to employment, including on receipt of a notice that an injured employee is eligible to receive temporary income benefits.  The insurance carrier shall notify the employer of the availability of the return-to-work reimbursement program under Section [413.022](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=413.022).   The insurance carrier shall evaluate a compensable injury in which the injured employee sustains an injury that could potentially result in lost time from employment as early as practicable to determine if skilled case management is necessary for the injured employee's case.  As necessary, case managers who are appropriately certified shall be used to perform these evaluations.  A claims adjuster may not be used as a case manager.  These services may be offered by insurance carriers in conjunction with the accident prevention services provided under Section [411.061](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=411.061).  Nothing in this section supersedes the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement between an employer and the employer's employees, and nothing in this section authorizes or requires an employer to engage in conduct that would otherwise be a violation of the employer's obligations under the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. Section 151 et seq.).
    
    (b)  Return-to-work coordination services under this section may include:
    
    (1)  job analysis to identify the physical demands of a job;
    
    (2)  job modification and restructuring assessments as necessary to match job requirements with the functional capacity of an employee;  and
    
    (3)  medical or vocational case management to coordinate the efforts of the employer, the treating doctor, and the injured employee to achieve timely return to work.
    
    (c)  An insurance carrier is not required to provide physical workplace modifications under this section and is not liable for the cost of modifications made under this section to facilitate an employee's return to employment.
    
    (d)  The division shall use certified rehabilitation counselors or other appropriately trained or credentialed specialists to provide training to division staff regarding the coordination of return-to-work services under this section.
    
    (e)  The commissioner shall adopt rules necessary to collect data on return-to-work outcomes to allow full evaluations of successes and of barriers to achieving timely return to work after an injury.

    (B)  is a type of employer designated as eligible to participate in the program by the commissioner.
    
    (3)  "Program" means the return-to-work reimbursement program established under this section.
    
    (b)  The commissioner shall establish by rule a return-to-work reimbursement program designed to promote the early and sustained return to work of an injured employee who sustains a compensable injury.  The commissioner, by rule, may expand eligibility to participate in the program to types of employers who are not described by Subsection (a)(2)(A).
    
    (c)  The program shall reimburse from the account an eligible employer for expenses incurred by the employer to make workplace modifications necessary to accommodate an injured employee's return to modified or alternative work.  Reimbursement under this section to an eligible employer may not exceed $5,000.  The expenses must be incurred to allow the employee to perform modified or alternative work within doctor-imposed work restrictions.  Allowable expenses may include:
    
    (1)  physical modifications to the worksite;
    
    (2)  equipment, devices, furniture, or tools; and
    
    (3)  other costs necessary for reasonable accommodation of the employee's restrictions.
    
    (c-1)  The commissioner by rule shall establish an optional preauthorization plan for eligible employers who participate in the program.  To participate in the preauthorization plan, an employer must submit a proposal to the division, in the manner prescribed by the division, that describes the workplace modifications and other changes that the employer proposes to make to accommodate an injured employee's return to work.  If the division approves the employer's proposal, the division shall guarantee reimbursement of the expenses incurred by the employer in implementing the modifications and changes from the account unless the division determines that the modifications and changes differ materially from the employer's proposal.  If determined to be a public purpose by the commissioner, and in accordance with rules adopted by the commissioner, the division may provide the employer an advance of funds under this subsection. Reimbursement or an advance of funds under this subsection is subject to the limit imposed under Subsection (c).
    
    (d)  The account is established as a special account in the general revenue fund.  From administrative penalties received by the division under this subtitle, the commissioner shall deposit in the account an amount not to exceed $100,000 annually.  Money in the account may be spent by the division, on appropriation by the legislature, only for the purposes of implementing this section.
    
    (e)  An employer who wilfully applies for or receives reimbursement from the account under this section knowing that the employer is not an eligible employer commits a violation.
    
    (f)  Notwithstanding Subsections (a)-(e), this section may be implemented only to the extent funds are available.
    
    (g)  The commissioner shall adopt rules as necessary to implement this section.

    Sec. 413.031.  MEDICAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION.  (a)  A party, including a health care provider, is entitled to a review of a medical service provided or for which authorization of payment is sought if a health care provider is:

    (2)  denied authorization for the payment for the service requested or performed if authorization is required or allowed by this subtitle or commissioner rules;
    
    (3)  ordered by the commissioner to refund a payment received; or
    
    (4)  ordered to make a payment that was refused or reduced for a medical service rendered.
    
    (b)  A health care provider who submits a charge in excess of the fee guidelines or treatment policies is entitled to a review of the medical service to determine if reasonable medical justification exists for the deviation.  A claimant is entitled to a review of a medical service for which preauthorization is sought by the health care provider and denied by the insurance carrier.  The commissioner shall adopt rules to notify claimants of their rights under this subsection.
    
    (c)  In resolving disputes over the amount of payment due for services determined to be medically necessary and appropriate for treatment of a compensable injury, the role of the division is to adjudicate the payment given the relevant statutory provisions and commissioner rules.  The division shall publish on its Internet website the division's medical dispute decisions, including decisions of independent review organizations, and any subsequent decisions by the State Office of Administrative Hearings.  Before publication, the division shall redact only that information necessary to prevent identification of the injured worker.

It is a defense for the insurance carrier if the carrier timely complies with the decision of the independent review organization.
    
    (e)  Except as provided by Subsections (d), (f), and (m), a review of the medical necessity of a health care service provided under this chapter or Chapter [408](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=408) shall be conducted by an independent review organization under Chapter [4202](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=4202), Insurance Code, in the same manner as reviews of utilization review decisions by health maintenance organizations.
