(a)  An eligible individual who is totally unemployed in a benefit period is entitled to benefits for the benefit period at the rate of  1/25 of the wages received by the individual from employment by employers during that quarter in the individual's base period in which wages were highest.  For purposes of this subsection, the wages received by the individual from employment by employers during the individual's base period include wages ordered to be paid to the individual by a final order of the commission under Chapter [61](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=61) that:

    (c)  The commission shall determine the average weekly wage in covered employment and compute the maximum and minimum weekly benefit amount not later than October 1 of each year based on the annual average weekly wage for the preceding year.  If a benefit amount computed under this subsection includes cents, the commission shall adjust the benefit amount as follows:
    
    (1)  if the computed benefit amount includes at least one cent but not more than 49 cents, the commission shall round the benefit down to the nearest multiple of $1; and
    
    (2)  if the computed benefit amount includes at least 50 cents but not more than 99 cents, the commission shall round the benefit amount up to the nearest multiple of $1.
    
    (c-1)  An increase in the maximum weekly benefit amount may not exceed $14 in any year.  An increase in the minimum weekly benefit amount may not exceed $1 in any year.
    
    (d)  An increase in maximum and minimum benefit amounts under this section takes effect on October 1.

    Sec. 207.026.  DRUG SCREENING OR TESTING AS CONDITION OF BENEFIT ELIGIBILITY FOR CERTAIN APPLICANTS AND RECIPIENTS.  (a)  The commission by rule shall adopt a drug screening and testing program as part of the requirements for the receipt of benefits under this subtitle by an individual to whom Section [207.021](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=207.021)(b-1) applies.  The program must:
    
    (1)  comply with the drug testing requirements of 49 C.F.R. Part 382 or other similar national requirements for drug testing programs recognized by the commission; and
    
    (2)  be designed to protect the rights of benefit applicants and recipients.
    
    (b)  Under the program, each individual to whom Section [207.021](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=207.021)(b-1) applies who files an initial claim must submit to and pass a drug screening assessment developed and administered by or on behalf of the commission for purposes of this subsection as a prerequisite to receiving benefits under this subtitle.  The assessment tool used under this subsection must consist of a written questionnaire to be completed by the individual applying for benefits and must be designed to accurately determine the reasonable likelihood that an individual is using a substance that is subject to regulation under Chapter [481](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=481), Health and Safety Code.  An individual whose drug screening assessment indicates a reasonable likelihood of use by the individual of a substance subject to regulation under that chapter must submit to and pass a drug test administered by or on behalf of the commission to establish the individual's eligibility for benefits under this subtitle.  An individual who fails a drug test required under this subsection under a final determination or decision under this section is not eligible to receive benefits under this subtitle until the individual has passed a subsequent drug test administered by or on behalf of the commission not earlier than four weeks after the date the individual submitted to the failed drug test.
    
    (c)  Notwithstanding Subsection (b), an individual is not ineligible to receive benefits based on the individual's failure to pass a drug test if, on the basis of evidence presented by the individual, the commission determines that, subject to Section [207.021](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=207.021)(a)(4):
    
    (1)  the individual is participating in a treatment program for drug abuse;
    
    (2)  the individual enrolls in and attends a treatment program for drug abuse not later than the seventh day after the date initial notice of the failed drug test is sent to the individual; or
    
    (3)  the failure to pass the test is caused by the use of a substance that was prescribed by a health care practitioner as medically necessary for the individual.
    
    (d)  The commission shall prescribe procedures for providing initial notice to an individual who fails a drug test under Subsection (b), for an appeal under Chapter [212](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=212), and for the retaking of a failed drug test by an individual under this section.  The procedures must provide:
    
    (1)  for prompt initial notice by mail to an individual who fails a drug test under Subsection (b) regarding:
    
    (A)  the fact of the individual's failure of the drug test;
    
    (B)  the manner in which the individual may notify the commission that the individual has enrolled in and is attending a treatment program for drug abuse;
    
    (C)  the manner in which the individual may appeal and retake the failed drug test; and
    
    (D)  common potential causes of a false positive test result;
    
    (2)  for privacy with regard to the individual's drug test result until not later than the 14th day after the date the initial notice of the failed drug test was mailed to the individual during which time the individual may appeal and retake the failed drug test; and
    
    (3)  that a determination or decision that an individual has failed a drug test under this section becomes final on:
    
    (A)  the 15th day after the date the initial notice of the failed drug test was mailed to the individual if the individual does not appeal and retake the individual's failed drug test as provided by this section; or
    
    (B)  the date that a retest conducted pursuant to an appeal by the individual as provided by this section confirms the positive drug test result.
    
    (e)  The commission shall administer the program under this section using existing administrative funds and any funds appropriated to the commission for the purposes of this section.
