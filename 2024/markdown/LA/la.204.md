    (7)  was caused by a natural disaster, fire, flood, or explosion that causes employees to be separated from one employer's employment;

    (B)  resulted from the spouse's permanent change of station of longer than 120 days or a tour of duty of longer than one year;

    (2)  the employee worked for the employer for less than four weeks.
    
    (a-2)  Benefits computed on benefit wage credits of an employee may not be charged to the account of an employer if the employee continued to work the employee's customary hours for the employer when the employee's benefit year began.

    (e)  Benefits may not be charged to the account of an employer, regardless of whether the liability for the chargeback arises in the employee's current benefit year or in a subsequent benefit year, if the employee's last separation from the employer's employment before the employee's benefit year was or would have been excepted from disqualification under Section [207.023](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=207.023)(b)(2) or [207.045](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=207.045)(j).

    SUBCHAPTER E. ACQUISITION OF EXPERIENCE-RATED EMPLOYER
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 204.081.  DEFINITIONS.  (a)  In this subchapter:
    
    (1)  "Compensation experience" includes the period that benefit wage credits or benefits have been chargeable and any other factor under Subchapter A, B, C, or D necessary to the computation of experience rating under those subchapters.
    
    (2)  "Person" means an individual, trust, estate, partnership, association, company, or corporation.
    
    (3)  "Substantially common management or control" exists if, after the acquisition of the organization, trade, or business of an employing unit, the predecessor employing unit continues to:
    
    (A)  own or manage the organization that conducts the organization, trade, or business;
    
    (B)  own or manage the assets necessary to conduct the organization, trade, or business;
    
    (C)  control through security or lease arrangements the assets necessary to conduct the organization, trade, or business; or
    
    (D)  direct the internal affairs or conduct of the organization, trade, or business.
    
    (4)  "Substantially common ownership" exists if, on the date of an acquisition of the organization, trade, or business of an employing unit, a shareholder, officer, or other owner of a legal or equitable interest in the predecessor employing unit, or the spouse or a person within the first degree of consanguinity or affinity, as determined under Chapter [573](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=573), Government Code, of the shareholder, officer, or other owner:
    
    (A)  is a shareholder, officer, or other owner of a legal or equitable interest in the successor employing unit; or
    
    (B)  holds an option to purchase a legal or equitable interest in the successor employing unit.
    
    (5)  "Transfer of trade or business" includes the transfer of part or all of an employer's workforce to another employer if, as the result of the transfer, the transferring employer no longer performs trade or business with respect to the transferred workforce and the employer to whom the workforce is transferred performs trade or business with respect to the workforce.

ACQUISITION OF PART OF EXPERIENCE-RATED ORGANIZATION, TRADE, OR BUSINESS:  APPROVAL OF TRANSFER OF COMPENSATION EXPERIENCE WITHOUT SUBSTANTIALLY COMMON MANAGEMENT OR CONTROL OR SUBSTANTIALLY COMMON OWNERSHIP; CONTRIBUTION RATE.  (a)  If an employing unit acquires or otherwise receives, through any means, part of the organization, trade, or business of an employer, and transfer of compensation experience is not required by Section [204.083](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=204.083), the successor employing unit and the predecessor employer may jointly make a written application to the commission to transfer the compensation experience of the predecessor employer that is attributable to the part of the organization, trade, or business acquired to the successor employing unit.
    
    (b)  If the acquisition results from the death of the predecessor employer, the requirement that the predecessor employer join in the application for transfer of the compensation experience does not apply.
    
    (c)  Except as provided by Subsection (d), the commission shall approve an application if:
    
    (1)  immediately after the acquisition the successor employing unit continues operation of substantially the same part of the organization, trade, or business acquired;

    (B)  the wages attributable to the acquired part of the organization, trade, or business are solely attributable to services provided on behalf of the acquired part of the organization, trade, or business.
    
    (d)  The commission shall deny a transfer of compensation experience under this section if the commission determines that the transfer was done primarily to qualify for a reduced compensation experience rating by either:
    
    (1)  circumventing the experience rating system; or
    
    (2)  manipulating the experience rating system by minimizing the impact of chargebacks to the predecessor's or successor's tax account.
    
    (e)  A successor employing unit that acquires compensation experience under this section and that is an experience-rated employer on the date of and during the period preceding the acquisition shall pay contributions from the date of the acquisition until the end of the calendar year in which the acquisition occurred at the rate applicable to the successor employing unit on the date of acquisition.
