    Sec. 408.001.  EXCLUSIVE REMEDY;  EXEMPLARY DAMAGES.  (a)  Recovery of workers' compensation benefits is the exclusive remedy of an employee covered by workers' compensation insurance coverage or a legal beneficiary against the employer or an agent or employee of the employer for the death of or a work-related injury sustained by the employee.
    
    (b)  This section does not prohibit the recovery of exemplary damages by the surviving spouse or heirs of the body of a deceased employee whose death was caused by an intentional act or omission of the employer or by the employer's gross negligence.
    
    (c)  In this section, "gross negligence" has the meaning assigned by Section [41.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=41.001), Civil Practice and Remedies Code.
    
    (d)  A determination under Section [406.032](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=406.032), [409.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=409.002), or [409.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=409.004) that a work-related injury is noncompensable does not adversely affect the exclusive remedy provisions under Subsection (a).

    Sec. 408.003.  REIMBURSABLE EMPLOYER PAYMENTS;  SALARY CONTINUATION;  OFFSET AGAINST INCOME BENEFITS;  LIMITS.  (a)  After an injury, an employer may:
    
    (1)  initiate benefit payments, including medical benefits;  or
    
    (2)  on the written request or agreement of the employee, supplement income benefits paid by the insurance carrier by an amount that does not exceed the amount computed by subtracting the amount of the income benefit payments from the employee's net preinjury wages.
    
    (b)  If an injury is found to be compensable and an insurance carrier initiates compensation, the insurance carrier shall reimburse the employer for the amount of benefits paid by the employer to which the employee was entitled under this subtitle.  Payments that are not reimbursed or reimbursable under this section may be reimbursed under Section [408.127](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=408.127).

    (1)  may not be construed as an admission of compensability;  and
    
    (2)  do not affect the payment of benefits from another source.
    
    (e)  If an employer does not notify the insurance carrier of the injury in compliance with Section [409.005](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=409.005), the employer waives the right to reimbursement under this section.
    
    (f)  Salary continuation payments made by an employer for an employee's disability resulting from a compensable injury shall be considered payment of income benefits for the purpose of determining the accrual date of any subsequent income benefits under this subtitle.
    
    (g)  If an employer is subject to a contractual obligation with an employee or group of employees, such as a collective bargaining agreement or a written agreement or policy, under which the employer is required to make salary continuation payments, the employer is not eligible for reimbursement under this section for those payments.
    
    (h)  Payments made as salary continuation or salary supplementation do not affect the exclusive remedy provisions of Section [408.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=408.001).

    Sec. 408.004.  REQUIRED MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS;  ADMINISTRATIVE VIOLATION.
    
    (a)  The commissioner may require an employee to submit to medical examinations to resolve any question about  the appropriateness of the health care received by the employee.
    
    (a-1)  A doctor, other than a chiropractor, who performs a required medical examination under this section is subject to Section [408.0043](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=408.0043).  A chiropractor who performs a required medical examination under this section is subject to Section [408.0045](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=408.0045).
    
    (b)  The commissioner may require an employee to submit to a medical examination at the request of the insurance carrier, but only after the insurance carrier has attempted and failed to receive the permission and concurrence of the employee for the examination.  Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, the insurance carrier is entitled to the examination only once in a 180-day period.  The commissioner may adopt rules that require an employee to submit to not more than three medical examinations in a 180-day period under specified circumstances, including to determine whether there has been a change in the employee's condition and whether it is necessary to change the employee's diagnosis.  The commissioner by rule shall adopt a system for monitoring requests made under this subsection by insurance carriers.  That system must ensure that good cause exists for any additional medical examination allowed under this subsection that is not requested by the employee.  A subsequent examination must be performed by the same doctor unless otherwise approved by the commissioner.
    
    (c)  The insurance carrier shall pay for:
    
    (1)  an examination required under Subsection (a) or (b);  and
    
    (2)  the reasonable expenses incident to the employee in submitting to the examination.
    
    (d)  An injured employee is entitled to have a doctor of the employee's choice present at an examination required by the division at the request of an insurance carrier.  The insurance carrier shall pay a fee set by the commissioner to the doctor selected by the employee.
    
    (e)  An employee who, without good cause as determined by the commissioner, fails or refuses to appear at the time scheduled for an examination under Subsection (a) or (b) commits an administrative violation.   The commissioner by rule shall ensure that an employee receives reasonable notice of an examination and that the employee is provided a reasonable opportunity to reschedule an examination missed by the employee for good cause.
    
    (f)  This section does not apply to health care provided through a workers' compensation health care network established under Chapter [1305](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1305), Insurance Code.
    
    (g)  An insurance carrier who makes a frivolous request for a medical examination under Subsection (b), as determined by the commissioner, commits an administrative violation.

    Sec. 408.0041.  DESIGNATED DOCTOR EXAMINATION.  (a)  At the request of an insurance carrier or an employee, or on the commissioner's own order, the commissioner may order a medical examination to resolve any question about:
    
    (1)  the impairment caused by the compensable injury;
    
    (2)  the attainment of maximum medical improvement;
    
    (3)  the extent of the employee's compensable injury;
    
    (4)  whether the injured employee's disability is a direct result of the work-related injury;
    
    (5)  the ability of the employee to return to work; or
    
    (6)  issues similar to those described by Subdivisions (1)-(5).
    
    (b)  Except as provided by Section [408.1225](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=408.1225)(f), a medical examination requested under Subsection (a) shall be performed by the next available doctor on the division's list of certified designated doctors whose credentials are appropriate for the area of the body affected by the injury and the injured employee's diagnosis as determined by commissioner rule.   The division shall assign a designated doctor not later than the 10th day after the date on which the request under Subsection (a) is approved, and the examination must be conducted not later than the 21st day after the date on which the commissioner issues the order under Subsection (a).  An examination under this section may not be conducted more frequently than every 60 days, unless good cause for more frequent examinations exists, as defined by commissioner rules.
    
    (b-1)  A designated doctor, other than a chiropractor, is subject to Section [408.0043](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=408.0043).  A designated doctor who is a chiropractor is subject to Section [408.0045](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=408.0045).  To the extent of a conflict between this section and Section [408.0043](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=408.0043) or [408.0045](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=408.0045), this section controls.
    
    (c)  The treating doctor and the insurance carrier are both responsible for sending to the designated doctor all of the injured employee's medical records relating to the issue to be evaluated by the designated doctor that are in their possession.  The treating doctor and insurance carrier may send the records without a signed release from the employee.  The designated doctor is authorized to receive the employee's confidential medical records to assist in the resolution of disputes.  The treating doctor and insurance carrier may also send the designated doctor an analysis of the injured employee's medical condition, functional abilities, and return-to-work opportunities.
    
    (d)  To avoid undue influence on a person selected as a designated doctor under this section, and except as provided by Subsection (c), only the injured employee or an appropriate member of the division's staff may communicate with the designated doctor about the case regarding the injured employee's medical condition or history before the examination of the injured employee by the designated doctor.  After that examination is completed, communication with the designated doctor regarding the injured employee's medical condition or history may be made only through appropriate division staff members.  The designated doctor may initiate communication with any doctor or health care provider who has previously treated or examined the injured employee for the work-related injury or with peer reviewers identified by the insurance carrier.
    
    (e)  The designated doctor shall report to the division.  The report of the designated doctor has presumptive weight unless the preponderance of the evidence is to the contrary.  An employer may make a bona fide offer of employment subject to Sections [408.103](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=408.103)(e) and [408.144](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=408.144)(c) based on the designated doctor's report.
    
    (f)  Unless otherwise ordered by the commissioner, the insurance carrier shall pay benefits based on the opinion of the designated doctor during the pendency of any dispute. If an insurance carrier is not satisfied with the opinion rendered by a designated doctor under this section, the insurance carrier may request the commissioner to order an employee to attend an examination by a doctor selected by the insurance carrier. 
    
    (f-1)  The subsequent injury fund shall reimburse an insurance carrier for any overpayment of benefits made by the insurance carrier under Subsection (f) based on an opinion rendered by a designated doctor if that opinion is reversed or modified by a final arbitration award or a final order or decision of the commissioner or a court.  The commissioner shall adopt rules to provide for a periodic reimbursement schedule, providing reimbursement at least annually.
    
    (f-2)  An employee required to be examined by a designated doctor may request a medical examination to determine maximum medical improvement and the employee's impairment rating from the treating doctor or from another doctor to whom the employee is referred by the treating doctor if:
    
    (1)  the designated doctor's opinion is the employee's first evaluation of maximum medical improvement and impairment rating; and
    
    (2)  the employee is not satisfied with the designated doctor's opinion.
    
    (f-3)  The commissioner shall provide the insurance carrier and the employee with reasonable time to obtain and present the opinion of a doctor selected under Subsection (f) or (f-2) before the commissioner makes a decision on the merits of the issue.
    
    (f-4)  The commissioner by rule shall adopt guidelines prescribing the circumstances under which an examination by the employee's treating doctor or another doctor to whom the employee is referred by the treating doctor to determine any issue under Subsection (a), other than an examination under Subsection (f-2), may be appropriate.
    
    (g)  Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, an injured employee is entitled to have a doctor of the employee's choice present at an examination requested by an insurance carrier under Subsection (f).  The insurance carrier shall pay a fee set by the commissioner to the doctor selected by the employee.  If the injured employee is subject to a workers' compensation health care network under Chapter [1305](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1305), Insurance Code, the doctor must be the employee's treating doctor.
    
    (h)  The insurance carrier shall pay for:
    
    (1)  an examination required under Subsection (a), (f), or (f-2), unless otherwise prohibited by this subtitle or by an order or rule of the commissioner; and
    
    (2)  the reasonable expenses incident to the employee in submitting to the examination.
    
    (i)  An employee who, without good cause as determined by the commissioner, fails or refuses to appear at the time scheduled for an examination under Subsection (a) or (f) commits an administrative violation.  An injured employee may not be fined more than $10,000 for a violation of this subsection.
    
    (j)  An employee is not entitled to temporary income benefits, or to lifetime income benefits under Section [408.1615](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=408.1615), if applicable to the employee, and an insurance carrier is authorized to suspend the payment of those benefits, during and for a period in which the employee fails to submit to an examination required by Subsection (a) or (f) or, if applicable, Section [408.1615](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=408.1615)(h), unless the commissioner determines that the employee had good cause for the failure to submit to the examination.  The commissioner may order temporary income benefits or lifetime income benefits under Section [408.1615](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=408.1615), as applicable, to be paid for the period for which the commissioner determined that the employee had good cause.  The commissioner by rule shall ensure that:
    
    (1)  an employee receives reasonable notice of an examination and the insurance carrier's basis for suspension; and
    
    (2)  the employee is provided a reasonable opportunity to reschedule an examination for good cause.
    
    (k)  If the report of a designated doctor indicates that an employee has reached maximum medical improvement or is otherwise able to return to work immediately, the insurance carrier may suspend or reduce the payment of temporary income benefits immediately.
    
    (k-1)  If the report of a designated doctor indicates that an employee receiving lifetime income benefits under Section [408.1615](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=408.1615) is no longer entitled to those benefits, the insurance carrier may suspend the payment of lifetime income benefits as provided by that section.
    
    (l)  A person who makes a frivolous request for a medical examination under Subsection (a) or (f), as determined by the commissioner, commits an administrative violation.

    (d)  Any treatment for an injury or diagnosis that is not accepted by the insurance carrier under Subsection (c) as compensable at the time of the medical examination under Subsection (a) must be preauthorized before treatment is rendered.

(a)  Except in an emergency, the division shall require an employee to receive medical treatment from a doctor chosen from a list of doctors approved by the commissioner.  A doctor may perform only those procedures that are within the scope of the practice for which the doctor is licensed.  The employee is entitled to the employee's initial choice of a doctor from the division's list.
    
    (b)  If an employee is dissatisfied with the initial choice of a doctor from the division's list, the employee may notify the division and request authority to select an alternate doctor.  The notification must be in writing stating the reasons for the change, except notification may be by telephone when a medical necessity exists for immediate change.
    
    (c)  The commissioner shall prescribe criteria to be used by the division in granting the employee authority to select an alternate doctor.  The criteria may include:
    
    (1)  whether treatment by the current doctor is medically inappropriate;
    
    (2)  the professional reputation of the doctor;
    
    (3)  whether the employee is receiving appropriate medical care to reach maximum medical improvement; and

    (d)  A change of doctor may not be made to secure a new impairment rating or medical report.
    
    (e)  For purposes of this section, the following is not a selection of an alternate doctor:
    
    (1)  a referral made by the doctor chosen by the employee if the referral is medically reasonable and necessary;
    
    (2)  the receipt of services ancillary to surgery;
    
    (3)  the obtaining of a second or subsequent opinion only on the appropriateness of the diagnosis or treatment;
    
    (4)  the selection of a doctor because the original doctor:
    
    (A)  dies;
    
    (B)  retires;  or
    
    (C)  becomes unavailable or unable to provide medical care to the employee;  or
    
    (5)  a change of doctors required because of a change of residence by the employee.
    
    (f)  This section does not apply to requirements regarding the selection of a doctor under a workers' compensation health care network established under Chapter [1305](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1305), Insurance Code, except as provided by that chapter.

    (c)  The division shall issue to a doctor who is approved by the commissioner a certificate of registration.  In determining whether to issue a certificate of registration, the commissioner may consider and condition approval on any practice restrictions applicable to the applicant that are relevant to services provided under this subtitle.  The commissioner may also consider the practice restrictions of an applicant when determining appropriate sanctions under Section [408.0231](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=408.0231).
    
    (d)  A certificate of registration issued under this section is valid, unless revoked, suspended, or revised, for the period provided by commissioner rule and may be renewed on application to the division.

    (e)  Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, a doctor not licensed in this state but licensed in another state or jurisdiction who treats employees or performs utilization review of health care for an insurance carrier may apply for a certificate of registration under this section to be included on the division's list of approved doctors.
    
    (f)  Except in an emergency or for immediate post-injury medical care as defined by commissioner rule, or as provided by Subsection (h), (i), or (j), each doctor who performs functions under this subtitle, including examinations under this chapter, must hold a certificate of registration and be on the division's list of approved doctors in order to perform services or receive payment for those services.
    
    (g)  The commissioner by rule shall modify registration and training requirements for doctors who infrequently provide health care or who perform utilization review or peer review functions for insurance carriers as necessary to ensure that those doctors are informed of the regulations that affect health care benefit delivery under this subtitle.
    
    (h)  A utilization review agent or an insurance carrier that uses doctors to perform reviews of health care services provided under this subtitle, including utilization review, may only use doctors licensed to practice in this state.

    (k)  The requirements of Subsections (a)-(g) and Subsection (i) expire September 1, 2007.  Before that date, the commissioner may waive the application of the provisions of Subsections (a)-(g) and Subsection (i) that require doctors to hold a certificate of registration and to be on the list of approved doctors if the commissioner determines that:
    
    (1)  injured employees have adequate access to health care providers who are willing to treat injured employees for compensable injuries through workers' compensation health care networks certified under Chapter [1305](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1305), Insurance Code; or

    (1)  comply with the requirements established by commissioner rule under Subsections (l) and (m) and with Section [413.041](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=413.041) regarding the disclosure of financial interests; and
    
    (2)  if the doctor intends to provide certifications of maximum medical improvement or assign impairment ratings, comply with the impairment rating training and testing requirements established by commissioner rule under Subsection (n).
    
    (p)  A person required to comply with Subsection (o), including a doctor who contracts with a workers' compensation health care network, who does not comply with that section commits an administrative violation.
    
    (q)  An insurance carrier may not use, for the purpose of suspending temporary income benefits or computing impairment income benefits, a certification of maximum medical improvement or an impairment rating assigned by a doctor, including a doctor who contracts with a workers' compensation health care network certified under Chapter [1305](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1305), Insurance Code, who fails to comply with Subsection (o)(2).
    
    (r)  Notwithstanding the waiver or expiration of Subsections (a)-(g) and (i), there may be no direct or indirect provision of health care under this subtitle and rules adopted under this subtitle, and no direct or indirect receipt of remuneration under this subtitle and rules adopted under this subtitle by a doctor who:

    (2)  was not reinstated or restored by the Texas Workers' Compensation Commission or the division to the list of approved doctors before September 1, 2007.
    
    (s)  The waiver or expiration of Subsections (a)-(g) and (i) do not limit the division's ability to impose sanctions as provided by this subtitle and commissioner rules.

    Sec. 408.027.  PAYMENT OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDER.  (a)  A health care provider shall submit a claim for payment to the insurance carrier not later than the 95th day after the date on which the health care services are provided to the injured employee.  Failure by the health care provider to timely submit a claim for payment constitutes a forfeiture of the provider's right to reimbursement for that claim for payment.
    
    (b)  The insurance carrier must pay, reduce, deny, or determine to audit the health care provider's claim not later than the 45th day after the date of receipt by the carrier of the provider's claim.  The carrier may request additional documentation necessary to clarify the provider's charges at any time during the 45-day period.  If the insurance carrier requests additional documentation under this subsection, the health care provider must provide the requested documentation not later than the 15th day after the date of receipt of the carrier's request.  If the insurance carrier elects to audit the claim, the carrier must complete the audit not later than the 160th day after the date of receipt by the carrier of the health care provider's claim, and, not later than the 160th day after the receipt of the claim, must make a determination regarding the relationship of the health care services provided to the compensable injury, the extent of the injury, and the medical necessity of the services provided.  If the insurance carrier chooses to audit the claim, the insurance carrier must pay to the health care provider not later than the 45th day after the date of receipt by the carrier of the provider's claim 85 percent of:
    
    (1)  the amount for the health care service established under the fee guidelines authorized under this subtitle if the health care service is not provided through a workers' compensation health care network under Chapter [1305](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1305), Insurance Code; or
    
    (2)  the amount of the contracted rate for that health care service if the health care service is provided through a workers' compensation health care network under Chapter [1305](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1305), Insurance Code.
    
    (c)  If the health care services provided are determined to be appropriate, the insurance carrier shall pay the health care provider the remaining 15 percent of the claim not later than the 160th day after the date of receipt by the carrier of the health care provider's documentation of the claim.  An insurance carrier commits an administrative violation if the carrier, in violation of Subsection (b), fails to:
    
    (1)  pay, reduce, deny, or notify the health care provider of the intent to audit the claim by the 45th day after the date of receipt by the carrier of the health care provider's claim; or
    
    (2)  pay, reduce, or deny an audited claim by the 160th day after the date of receipt of the claim.
    
    (d)  If an insurance carrier contests the compensability of an injury and the injury is determined not to be compensable, the carrier may recover the amounts paid for health care services from the employee's accident or health benefit plan, or any other person who may be obligated for the cost of the health care services.  If an accident or health insurance carrier or other person obligated for the cost of health care services has paid for health care services for an employee for an injury for which a workers' compensation insurance carrier denies compensability, and the injury is later determined to be compensable, the accident or health insurance carrier or other person may recover the amounts paid for such services from the workers' compensation insurance carrier.  If an accident or health insurance carrier or other person obligated for the cost of health care services has paid for health care services for an employee for an injury for which the workers' compensation insurance carrier or the employer has not disputed compensability, the accident or health insurance carrier or other person may recover reimbursement from the insurance carrier in the manner described by Section [409.009](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=409.009) or [409.0091](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=409.0091), as applicable.
    
    (e)  If an insurance carrier disputes the amount of payment or the health care provider's entitlement to payment, the insurance carrier shall send to the division, the health care provider, and the injured employee a report that sufficiently explains the reasons for the reduction or denial of payment for health care services provided to the employee.  The insurance carrier is entitled to a hearing as provided by Section [413.031](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=413.031)(d).
    
    (f)  Except as provided by Section [408.0281](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=408.0281) or [408.0284](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=408.0284), any payment made by an insurance carrier under this section shall be in accordance with the fee guidelines authorized under this subtitle if the health care service is not provided through a workers' compensation health care network under Chapter [1305](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1305), Insurance Code, or at a contracted rate for that health care service if the health care service is provided through a workers' compensation health care network under Chapter [1305](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1305), Insurance Code.

    (1)  notify the health care provider in writing of the carrier's decision; and
    
    (2)  demand a refund by the health care provider of the portion of payment on the claim that was received by the health care provider for the inappropriate services.
    
    (b)  The health care provider may appeal the insurance carrier's determination under Subsection (a).  The health care provider must file an appeal under this subsection with the insurance carrier not later than the 45th day after the date of the insurance carrier's request for the refund.  The insurance carrier must act on the appeal not later than the 45th day after the date on which the provider files the appeal.
    
    (c)  A health care provider shall reimburse the insurance carrier for payments received by the provider for inappropriate charges not later than the 45th day after the date of the carrier's notice.

    (b)  Notwithstanding Section [408.027](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=408.027), a health care provider who fails to timely submit a claim for payment to the insurance carrier under Section [408.027](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=408.027)(a) does not forfeit the provider's right to reimbursement for that claim for payment solely for failure to submit a timely claim if:
    
    (1)  the provider submits proof satisfactory to the commissioner that the provider, within the period prescribed by Section [408.027](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=408.027)(a), erroneously filed for reimbursement with:
    
    (A)  an insurer that issues a policy of group accident and health insurance under which the injured employee is a covered insured;
    
    (B)  a health maintenance organization that issues an evidence of coverage under which the injured employee is a covered enrollee; or
    
    (C)  a workers' compensation insurance carrier other than the insurance carrier liable for the payment of benefits under this title; or
    
    (2)  the commissioner determines that the failure resulted from a catastrophic event that substantially interfered with the normal business operations of the provider.

    Sec. 408.028.  PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES.  (a)  A physician providing care to an employee under this subchapter shall prescribe for the employee any necessary prescription drugs, and order over-the-counter alternatives to prescription medications as clinically appropriate and applicable, in accordance with applicable state law and as provided by Subsection (b).  A doctor providing care may order over-the-counter alternatives to prescription medications, when clinically appropriate, in accordance with applicable state law and as provided by Subsection (b).
    
    (b)  The commissioner by rule shall require the use of generic pharmaceutical medications and clinically appropriate over-the-counter alternatives to prescription medications unless otherwise specified by the prescribing doctor, in accordance with applicable state law.  The commissioner by rule shall adopt a closed formulary under Section [413.011](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=413.011).  Rules adopted by the commissioner shall allow an appeals process for claims in which a treating doctor determines and documents that a drug not included in the formulary is necessary to treat an injured employee's compensable injury.
    
    (c)  Except as otherwise provided by this subtitle, an insurance carrier may not require an employee to use pharmaceutical services designated by the carrier.
    
    (d)  The commissioner shall adopt rules to allow an employee to purchase over-the-counter alternatives to prescription medications prescribed or ordered under Subsection (a) or (b) and to obtain reimbursement from the insurance carrier for those medications.
    
    (e)  Notwithstanding Subsection (b), the commissioner by rule shall allow an employee to purchase a brand name drug rather than a generic pharmaceutical medication or over-the-counter alternative to a prescription medication if a health care provider prescribes a generic pharmaceutical medication or an over-the-counter alternative to a prescription medication.  The employee shall be responsible for paying the difference between the cost of the brand name drug and the cost of the generic pharmaceutical medication or of an over-the-counter alternative to a prescription medication.  The employee may not seek reimbursement for the difference in cost from an insurance carrier and is not entitled to use the medical dispute resolution provisions of Chapter [413](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=413) with regard to the prescription.  A payment described by this subsection by an employee to a health care provider does not violate Section [413.042](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=413.042).  This subsection does not affect the duty of a health care provider to comply with the requirements of Subsection (b) when prescribing medications or ordering over-the-counter alternatives to prescription medications.
    
    (f)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the commissioner by rule shall adopt a fee schedule for pharmacy and pharmaceutical services that will:
    
    (1)  provide reimbursement rates that are fair and reasonable;
    
    (2)  assure adequate access to medications and services for injured workers;
    
    (3)  minimize costs to employees and insurance carriers; and
    
    (4)  take into consideration the increased security of payment afforded by this subtitle.
    
    (g)  Section [413.011](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=413.011)(d) and the rules adopted to implement that subsection do not apply to the fee schedule adopted by the commissioner under Subsection (f).

    (b)  Notwithstanding any provision of Chapter [1305](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1305), Insurance Code, or Section 504.053 of this code, prescription medication or services, as defined by Section [401.011](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=401.011)(19)(E):
    
    (1)  may be reimbursed in accordance with the fee guidelines adopted by the commissioner or at a contract rate in accordance with this section; and
    
    (2)  may not be delivered through:
    
    (A)  a workers' compensation health care network under Chapter [1305](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1305), Insurance Code; or
    
    (B)  a contract described by Section [504.053](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=504.053)(b)(2).
    
    (c)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, including Section [408.028](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=408.028)(f), or any provision of Chapter [1305](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1305), Insurance Code, an insurance carrier may pay a health care provider fees for pharmaceutical services that are inconsistent with the fee guidelines adopted by the commissioner only if the carrier has a contract with the health care provider and that contract includes a specific fee schedule.  An insurance carrier or the carrier's authorized agent may use an informal or voluntary network to obtain a contractual agreement that provides for fees different from the fees authorized under the fee guidelines adopted by the commissioner for pharmaceutical services.  If a carrier or the carrier's authorized agent chooses to use an informal or voluntary network to obtain a contractual fee arrangement, there must be a contractual arrangement between:
    
    (1)  the carrier or authorized agent and the informal or voluntary network that authorizes the network to contract with health care providers for pharmaceutical services on the carrier's behalf; and
    
    (2)  the informal or voluntary network and the health care provider that includes a specific fee schedule and complies with the notice requirements of this section.
    
    (d)  An informal or voluntary network, or the carrier or the carrier's authorized agent, as appropriate, shall, at least quarterly, notify each health care provider of any person, other than an injured employee, to which the network's contractual fee arrangements with the health care provider are sold, leased, transferred, or conveyed.  Notice to each health care provider:
    
    (1)  must include:
    
    (A)  the contact information for the network, including the name, physical address, and toll-free telephone number at which a health care provider with which the network has a contract may contact the network; and
    
    (B)  in the body of the notice:
    
    (i)  the name, physical address, and telephone number of any person, other than an injured employee, to which the network's contractual fee arrangement with the health care provider is sold, leased, transferred, or conveyed; and
    
    (ii)  the start date and any end date of the period during which any person, other than an injured employee, to which the network's contractual fee arrangement with the health care provider is sold, leased, transferred, or conveyed; and
    
    (2)  may be provided:
    
    (A)  in an electronic format, if a paper version is available on request by the division; and
    
    (B)  through an Internet website link, but only if the website:
    
    (i)  contains the information described by Subdivision (1); and
    
    (ii)  is updated at least monthly with current and correct information.
    
    (e)  An informal or voluntary network, or the carrier or the carrier's authorized agent, as appropriate, shall document the delivery of the notice required under Subsection (d), including the method of delivery, to whom the notice was delivered, and the date of delivery.  For purposes of Subsection (d), a notice is considered to be delivered on, as applicable:
    
    (1)  the fifth day after the date the notice is mailed via United States Postal Service; or
    
    (2)  the date the notice is faxed or electronically delivered.
    
    (f)  An insurance carrier, or the carrier's authorized agent or an informal or voluntary network at the carrier's request, shall provide copies of each contract described by Subsection (c) to the division on the request of the division.  Information included in a contract under Subsection (c) is confidential and is not subject to disclosure under Chapter [552](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552), Government Code.  Notwithstanding Subsection (c), the insurance carrier may be required to pay fees in accordance with the division's fee guidelines if:
    
    (1)  the contract:
    
    (A)  is not provided to the division on the division's request;
    
    (B)  does not include a specific fee schedule consistent with Subsection (c); or
    
    (C)  does not clearly state that the contractual fee arrangement is between the health care provider and the named insurance carrier or the carrier's authorized agent; or
    
    (2)  the carrier or the carrier's authorized agent does not comply with the notice requirements under Subsection (d).
    
    (g)  Failure to provide documentation described by Subsection (e) to the division on the request of the division or failure to provide notice as required under Subsection (d) creates a rebuttable presumption in an enforcement action under this subtitle and in a medical fee dispute under Chapter [413](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=413) that a health care provider did not receive the notice.
    
    (h)  An insurance carrier or the carrier's authorized agent commits an administrative violation if the carrier or agent violates any provision of this section.  Any administrative penalty assessed under this subsection shall be assessed against the carrier, regardless of whether the carrier or agent committed the violation.
    
    (i)  Notwithstanding Section [1305.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1305.003)(b), Insurance Code, in the event of a conflict between this section and Section [413.016](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=413.016) or any other provision of Chapter [413](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=413) of this code or Chapter [1305](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=1305), Insurance Code, this section prevails.

    SUBCHAPTER C. COMPUTATION OF AVERAGE WEEKLY WAGE
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 408.041.  AVERAGE WEEKLY WAGE.  (a)  Except as otherwise provided by this subtitle, the average weekly wage of an employee who has worked for the employer for at least the 13 consecutive weeks immediately preceding an injury is computed by dividing the sum of the wages paid in the 13 consecutive weeks immediately preceding the date of the injury by 13.
    
    (b)  The average weekly wage of an employee whose wage at the time of injury has not been fixed or cannot be determined or who has worked for the employer for less than the 13 weeks immediately preceding the injury equals:
    
    (1)  the usual wage that the employer pays a similar employee for similar services;  or
    
    (2)  if a similar employee does not exist, the usual wage paid in that vicinity for the same or similar services provided for remuneration.
    
    (c)  If Subsection (a) or (b) cannot reasonably be applied because the employee's employment has been irregular or because the employee has lost time from work during the 13-week period immediately preceding the injury because of illness, weather, or another cause beyond the control of the employee, the commissioner may determine the employee's average weekly wage by any method that the commissioner considers fair, just, and reasonable to all parties and consistent with the methods established under this section.

    (b)  For part-time employees not covered by Subsection (a), the average weekly wage:
    
    (1)  for determining temporary income benefits is computed as provided by Section [408.041](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=408.041);  and
    
    (2)  for determining impairment income benefits, supplemental income benefits, lifetime income benefits, and death benefits is computed as follows:
    
    (A)  if the employee has worked for the employer for at least the 13 weeks immediately preceding the date of the injury, the average weekly wage is computed by dividing the sum of the wages paid in the 13 consecutive weeks immediately preceding the date of the injury by 13 and adjusting that amount to the weekly wage level the employee would have attained by working a full-time workweek at the same rate of pay;  or
    
    (B)  if the employee has worked for the employer for less than 13 weeks immediately preceding the date of the injury, the average weekly wage is equal to:
    
    (i)  the weekly wage that the employer pays a similar employee for similar services based on a full-time workweek;  or
    
    (ii)  if a similar employee does not exist, the usual wage paid in that vicinity for the same or similar services based on a full-time workweek.
    
    (c)  For employees with multiple employment, the average weekly wage for determining temporary income benefits, impairment income benefits, supplemental income benefits, lifetime income benefits, and death benefits, is computed as follows:
    
    (1)  the average weekly wage for an employee with multiple employment is equal to the sum of the average weekly wages computed under Subdivisions (2) and (3);
    
    (2)  for each of the employers for whom the employee has worked for at least the 13 weeks immediately preceding the date of injury, the average weekly wage is equal to the sum of the wages paid by that employer to the employee in the 13 weeks immediately preceding the injury divided by 13;
    
    (3)  for each of the employers for whom the employee has worked for less than the 13 weeks immediately preceding the date of the injury, the average weekly wage is equal to:
    
    (A)  the weekly wage that employer pays similar employees for similar services;  or
    
    (B)  if a similar employee does not exist, the usual weekly wage paid in that vicinity for the same or similar services;  and
    
    (4)  the average weekly wage of an employee with multiple employment who limits the employee's work to less than a full-time workweek, but does not do so as a regular course of that employee's conduct, is adjusted to the weekly wage level the employee would have attained by working a full-time workweek at the employee's average rate of pay.
    
    (d)  The commissioner shall:
    
    (1)  prescribe a form to collect information regarding the wages of employees with multiple employment; and
    
    (2)  by rule, determine the manner by which the division collects and distributes wage information to implement this section.
    
    (e)  For an employee with multiple employment, only the employee's wages that are reportable for federal income tax purposes may be considered.  The employee shall document and verify wage payments subject to this section.
    
    (f)  If the commissioner determines that computing the average weekly wage for an employee as provided by Subsection (c) is impractical or unreasonable, the commissioner shall set the average weekly wage in a manner that more fairly reflects the employee's average weekly wage and that is fair and just to both parties or is in the manner agreed to by the parties.  The commissioner by rule may define methods to determine a fair and just average weekly wage consistent with this section.
    
    (g)  An insurance carrier is entitled to apply for and receive reimbursement at least annually from the subsequent injury fund for the amount of income and death benefits paid to a worker under this section that are based on employment other than the employment during which the compensable injury occurred.  The commissioner may adopt rules that govern the documentation, application process, and other administrative requirements necessary to implement this subsection.
    
    (h)  In this section:
    
    (1)  "Employee with multiple employment" means an employee who has more than one employer.
    
    (2)  "Full-time workweek" means a 40-hour workweek.

    Sec. 408.043.  AVERAGE WEEKLY WAGE FOR SEASONAL EMPLOYEE.

    (b)  For determining the amount of impairment income benefits, supplemental income benefits, lifetime income benefits, or death benefits of a seasonal employee, the average weekly wage of the employee is computed by dividing the amount of total wages earned by the employee during the 12 months immediately preceding the date of the injury by 50.
    
    (c)  If, for good reason, the commissioner determines that computing the average weekly wage for a seasonal employee as provided by this section is impractical, the commissioner shall compute the average weekly wage as of the time of the injury in a manner that is fair and just to both parties.
    
    (d)  In this section, "seasonal employee" means an employee who, as a regular course of the employee's conduct, engages in seasonal or cyclical employment that does not continue throughout the entire year.

    (b)  An insurance carrier may adjust a school district employee's average weekly wage as often as necessary to reflect the wages the employee reasonably could expect to earn during the period for which temporary income benefits are paid.

    (1)  the sum of the employee's wages as reported in the most recent four quarterly wage reports to the Texas Workforce Commission divided by 52;
    
    (2)  the employee's wages in the single quarter of the most recent four quarters in which the employee's earnings were highest, divided by 13, if the commissioner finds that the employee's most recent four quarters' earnings reported in the Texas Workforce Commission wage reports are not representative of the employee's usual earnings; or
    
    (3)  the amount the commissioner determines from other credible evidence to be the actual earnings for the previous year if the Texas Workforce Commission does not have a wage report reflecting at least one quarter's earnings because the employee worked outside the state during the previous year.
    
    (c)  A presumption under Subsection (b) may be rebutted by other credible evidence of the employee's actual earnings.
    
    (d)  The Texas Employment Commission shall provide information required under this section in the manner most efficient for transferring the information.
    
    (e)  For purposes of Subsection (a), if an employee is offered a bona fide position of employment that the employee is reasonably capable of performing, given the physical condition of the employee and the geographic accessibility of the position to the employee, the employee's weekly earnings after the injury are equal to the weekly wage for the position offered to the employee.

    (c)  The report of the designated doctor has presumptive weight, and the division shall base its determination of whether the employee has reached maximum medical improvement on the report unless the preponderance of the other medical evidence is to the contrary.
    
    (d)  The commissioner shall develop rules to ensure that a designated doctor called on to conduct an examination under Section [408.0041](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=408.0041) has no conflict of interest in serving as a designated doctor in performing any examination.
    
    (e)  A designated doctor, other than a chiropractor, is subject to Section [408.0043](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=408.0043).

    Sec. 408.123.  CERTIFICATION OF MAXIMUM MEDICAL IMPROVEMENT; EVALUATION OF IMPAIRMENT RATING.  (a)  After an employee has been certified by a doctor as having reached maximum medical improvement, the certifying doctor shall evaluate the condition of the employee and assign an impairment rating using the impairment rating guidelines described by Section [408.124](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=408.124).  If the certification and evaluation are performed by a doctor other than the employee's treating doctor, the certification and evaluation shall be submitted to the treating doctor, and the treating doctor shall indicate agreement or disagreement with the certification and evaluation.
    
    (b)  A certifying doctor shall issue a written report certifying that maximum medical improvement has been reached, stating the employee's impairment rating, and providing any other information required by the commissioner to:

    (2)  the employee; and
    
    (3)  the insurance carrier.

    (d)  If an employee is not certified as having reached maximum medical improvement before the expiration of 102 weeks after the date income benefits begin to accrue, the division shall notify the treating doctor of the requirements of this subchapter.
    
    (e)  Except as otherwise provided by this section, an employee's first valid certification of maximum medical improvement and first valid assignment of an impairment rating is final if the certification or assignment is not disputed before the 91st day after the date written notification of the certification or assignment is provided to the employee and the carrier by verifiable means.
    
    (f)  An employee's first certification of maximum medical improvement or assignment of an impairment rating may be disputed after the period described by Subsection (e) if:
    
    (1)  compelling medical evidence exists of:
    
    (A)  a significant error by the certifying doctor in applying the appropriate American Medical Association guidelines or in calculating the impairment rating;
    
    (B)  a clearly mistaken diagnosis or a previously undiagnosed medical condition; or
    
    (C)  improper or inadequate treatment of the injury before the date of the certification or assignment that would render the certification or assignment invalid; or
    
    (2)  other compelling circumstances exist as prescribed by commissioner rule.
    
    (g)  If an employee has not been certified as having reached maximum medical improvement before the expiration of 104 weeks after the date income benefits begin to accrue or the expiration date of any extension of benefits under Section [408.104](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=408.104), the impairment rating assigned after the expiration of either of those periods is final if the impairment rating is not disputed before the 91st day after the date written notification of the certification or assignment is provided to the employee and the carrier by verifiable means.  A certification or assignment may be disputed after the 90th day only as provided by Subsection (f).
    
    (h)  If an employee's disputed certification of maximum medical improvement or assignment of impairment rating is finally modified, overturned, or withdrawn, the first certification or assignment made after the date of the modification, overturning, or withdrawal becomes final if the certification or assignment is not disputed before the 91st day after the date notification of the certification or assignment is provided to the employee and the carrier by verifiable means.  A certification or assignment may be disputed after the 90th day only as provided by Subsection (f).

    (c)  The report of the designated doctor shall have presumptive weight, and the division shall base the impairment rating on that report unless the preponderance of the other medical evidence is to the contrary.  If the preponderance of the medical evidence contradicts the impairment rating contained in the report of the designated doctor chosen by the division, the division shall adopt the impairment rating of one of the other doctors.
    
    (d)  To avoid undue influence on a person selected as a designated doctor under this section, only the injured employee or an appropriate member of the staff of the division may communicate with the designated doctor about the case regarding the injured employee's medical condition or history before the examination of the injured employee by the designated doctor.  After that examination is completed, communication with the designated doctor regarding the injured employee's medical condition or history may be made only through appropriate division staff members.  The designated doctor may initiate communication with any doctor who has previously treated or examined the injured employee for the work-related injury.
    
    (e)  Notwithstanding Subsection (d), the treating doctor and the insurance carrier are both responsible for sending to the designated doctor all the injured employee's medical records that are in their possession and that relate to the issue to be evaluated by the designated doctor.  The treating doctor and the insurance carrier may send the records without a signed release from the employee.  The designated doctor is authorized to receive the employee's confidential medical records to assist in the resolution of disputes.  The treating doctor and the insurance carrier may also send the designated doctor an analysis of the injured employee's medical condition, functional abilities, and return-to-work opportunities.
    
    (f)  A violation of Subsection (d) is an administrative violation.

    (j)  The commissioner shall adopt rules necessary to implement this section, including rules:

This subsection does not apply to attorney's fees for which an insurance carrier may be liable under Section [408.147](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=408.147).  An award of attorney's fees under this subsection is not subject to commissioner rules adopted under Subsection (f). 
    
    (d)  In approving an attorney's fee under this section, the commissioner or court shall consider:
    
    (1)  the time and labor required;
    
    (2)  the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved;
    
    (3)  the skill required to perform the legal services properly;
    
    (4)  the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services;
    
    (5)  the amount involved in the controversy;
    
    (6)  the benefits to the claimant that the attorney is responsible for securing; and
    
    (7)  the experience and ability of the attorney performing the services.
    
    (e)  The commissioner by rule or the court may provide for the commutation of an attorney's fee, except that the attorney's fee shall be paid in periodic payments in a claim involving death benefits if the only dispute is as to the proper beneficiary or beneficiaries.
    
    (f)  The commissioner by rule shall provide guidelines for maximum attorney's fees for specific services in accordance with this section.
    
    (g)  An attorney's fee may not be allowed in a case involving a fatal injury or lifetime income benefit if the insurance carrier admits liability on all issues and tenders payment of maximum benefits in writing under this subtitle while the claim is pending before the division.
    
    (h)  An attorney's fee shall be paid to the attorney by separate draft.
    
    (i)  Except as provided by Subsection (c) or Section 408. 147(c), an attorney's fee may not exceed 25 percent of the claimant's recovery.
