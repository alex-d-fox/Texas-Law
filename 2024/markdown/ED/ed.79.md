    (3)  to provide students with social development activities that enrich the academic curriculum and student life, including, as determined appropriate by the academy, University Interscholastic League activities and other extracurricular activities.

The academy shall admit only high school juniors and seniors, except that the academy may admit a student with exceptional abilities who is not yet a high school junior.  The board shall set aside adequate space at the new university to operate the academy and implement the purposes of this section.  The academy must operate on the same fall and spring semester basis as the university.  Full-time students of the academy must enroll for both the fall and spring semesters.  Faculty members of the university shall teach all academic classes at the academy.  A student of the academy may attend a college course offered by the university and receive college credit for that course.
    
    (c)  The university administration has the same powers and duties with respect to the academy that the administration has with respect to the university.  The board, in consultation with university administration, shall:

    (1)  in a program provided for the purposes prescribed by Subsection (a)(2) or another special enrichment course or in a physical education course;
    
    (2)  if the board determines that a class with a higher student-teacher ratio would contribute to the educational development of the students in the class; or
    
    (3)  if an academy class is combined with a university class with more than 30 students.
    
    (e)  The academy shall provide the university-level curriculum in a manner that is appropriate for the social, psychological, emotional, and physical development of high school juniors and seniors.  The administrative and counseling personnel of the academy shall provide continuous support to and supervision of students.
    
    (f)  For each student enrolled in the academy, the academy is entitled to allotments from the foundation school fund under Chapter [48](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48) as if the academy were a school district without a tier one local share for purposes of Section [48.266](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.266).  If in any academic year the amount of the allotments under this subsection exceeds the amount of state funds paid to the academy in the first fiscal year of the academy's operation, the commissioner of education shall set aside from the total amount of funds to which school districts are entitled under Section [48.266](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.266)(c) an amount equal to the excess amount and shall distribute that amount to the academy.  After deducting the amount set aside and paid to the academy by the commissioner of education under this subsection, the commissioner of education shall reduce the amount to which each district is entitled under Section [48.266](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.266)(c)  in the manner described by Section [48.266](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.266)(f).  A determination of the commissioner of education under this subsection is final and may not be appealed.
    
    (g)  The board may use any available money, enter into contracts, and accept grants, including matching grants, federal grants, and grants from a corporation or other private contributor, in establishing and operating the academy.  Money spent by the academy must further the purposes of the academy under Subsection (a).
    
    (h)  The liability of this state under Chapters [101](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=101) and [104](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=104), Civil Practice and Remedies Code, is limited for the academy and employees assigned to the academy and acting on behalf of the academy to the same extent that the liability of a school district and an employee of the school district is limited under Sections [22.0511](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=22.0511), [22.0512](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=22.0512), and [22.052](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=22.052) of this code and Section [101.051](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&Value=101.051), Civil Practice and Remedies Code.
