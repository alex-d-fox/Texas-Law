    Sec. 45.0021.  RESTRICTION ON MAINTENANCE TAX LEVY.  (a)  A school district may not levy the district's maintenance taxes described by Section [45.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=45.002) at a rate intended to create a surplus in maintenance tax revenue for the purpose of paying the district's debt service.
    
    (b)  A person who owns taxable property in a school district is entitled to an injunction restraining the collection of taxes by the district if the district adopts a maintenance tax rate in violation of Subsection (a). An action to enjoin the collection of taxes must be filed before the date the district delivers substantially all of the district's tax bills.
    
    (c)  The agency shall:
    
    (1)  develop a method to identify school districts that may have adopted a maintenance tax rate in violation of Subsection (a), which must include a review of data over multiple years;

    (B)  assist the district in developing a corrective action plan that, to the extent feasible, does not result in a net increase in the district's total tax rate; and
    
    (4)  post on the agency's Internet website a list of each school district the agency has determined to have adopted a maintenance tax rate in violation of Subsection (a).
    
    (d)  The implementation of a corrective action plan under Subsection (c)(3)(B) does not prohibit a school district from increasing the district's total tax rate as necessary to achieve other legal purposes.
    
    (e)  If a school district fails to take action under a corrective action plan developed under Subsection (c)(3)(B), the commissioner may reduce the district's entitlement under Chapter [48](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48) by an amount equal to the difference between:

    (1)  using a surplus in maintenance tax revenue to pay the district's debt service if:
    
    (A)  the district's interest and sinking fund tax revenue is insufficient to pay the district's debt service due to circumstances beyond the district's control; and
    
    (B)  the use of the surplus maintenance tax revenue to pay the district's debt service is necessary to prevent a default on the district's debt;
    
    (2)  paying a portion of the district's maintenance tax revenue into the tax increment fund for a reinvestment zone under Chapter [311](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=311), Tax Code; or
    
    (3)  using money disbursed from the tax increment fund for a reinvestment zone under Chapter [311](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=311), Tax Code, in accordance with the agreement entered into by the district with the governing body of the municipality or county that designated the zone under Section 311.013(f) of that code.

    Sec. 45.003.  BOND AND TAX ELECTIONS.  (a)  Bonds described by Section [45.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=45.001) may not be issued and taxes described by Section [45.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=45.001) or [45.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=45.002) may not be levied unless authorized by a majority of the qualified voters of the district, voting at an election held for that purpose, at the expense of the district, in accordance with the Election Code, except as provided by this section.  Each election must be called by resolution or order of the governing board or commissioners court.  The resolution or order must state the date of the election, the proposition or propositions to be submitted and voted on, the polling place or places, and any other matters considered necessary or advisable by the governing board or commissioners court.
    
    (b)  A proposition submitted to authorize the issuance of bonds must include the question of whether the governing board or commissioners court may levy, pledge, assess, and collect annual ad valorem taxes, on all taxable property in the district, either:
    
    (1)  sufficient, without limit as to rate or amount, to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds;  or
    
    (2)  sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds, provided that the annual aggregate bond taxes in the district may never be more than the rate stated in the proposition.

    (d)  A proposition submitted to authorize the levy of maintenance taxes must include the question of whether the governing board or commissioners court may levy, assess, and collect annual ad valorem taxes for the further maintenance of public schools, at a rate not to exceed the rate stated in the proposition.  For any year, the maintenance tax rate per $100 of taxable value adopted by the district may not exceed the rate equal to the sum of $0.17 and the district's maximum compressed rate, as determined under Section [48.2551](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.2551).
    
    (e)  A rate that exceeds the maximum rate specified by Subsection (d) for the year in which the tax is to be imposed is void.  A school district with a tax rate that is void under this subsection may, subject to requirements imposed by other law, adopt a rate for that year that does not exceed the maximum rate specified by Subsection (d) for that year.
    
    (f)  Notwithstanding any other law, a district that levied a maintenance tax for the 2005 tax year at a rate greater than $1.50 per $100 of taxable value in the district as permitted by special law may not levy a maintenance tax at a rate that exceeds the rate per $100 of taxable value that is equal to the sum of:
    
    (1)  $0.17; and
    
    (2)  the product of 66.67 percent multiplied by the rate of the maintenance tax levied by the district for the 2005 tax year, minus the amount by which $1.00 exceeds the product of the state compression percentage, as determined under Section [48.255](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.255), multiplied by $1.00.
    
    (g)  Notwithstanding Section [1251.052](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=1251.052), Government Code, the question of whether to approve the issuance of bonds for the construction, acquisition, and equipment of school buildings in the district, the purchase of new school buses, and the purchase of necessary sites for school buildings may be submitted to the voters in a single ballot proposition, except that bonds for each of the following purposes must be stated in a separate proposition:
    
    (1)  the construction, acquisition, or equipment of a stadium with seating capacity for more than 1,000 spectators;
    
    (2)  the construction, acquisition, or equipment of a natatorium;
    
    (3)  the construction, acquisition, or equipment of another recreational facility other than a gymnasium, playground, or play area;
    
    (4)  the construction, acquisition, or equipment of a performing arts facility;
    
    (5)  the construction, acquisition, or equipment of housing for teachers as determined by the district to be necessary to have a sufficient number of teachers for the district; and
    
    (6)  an acquisition or update of technology equipment, other than equipment used for school security purposes or technology infrastructure integral to the construction of a facility.
    
    (h)  The question of whether to approve the issuance of bonds for a building described by Subsection (g)(1), (2), (3), (4), or (5) must be printed on the ballot as a separate ballot proposition regardless of whether that building is proposed as part of the same complex or building that contains traditional classroom facilities.  Each separate ballot proposition required by this subsection must state the principal amount of the bonds to be issued that constitutes the cost for construction of that portion of the building or complex attributable to the building described by Subsection (g)(1), (2), (3), (4), or (5) or to the traditional classroom facilities, as applicable.

    Sec. 45.0031.  LIMITATION ON ISSUANCE OF TAX-SUPPORTED BONDS.  (a)  Before issuing bonds described by Section [45.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=45.001), a school district must demonstrate to the attorney general under Subsection (b) or (c) that, with respect to the proposed issuance, the district has a projected ability to pay the principal of and interest on the proposed bonds and all previously issued bonds other than bonds authorized to be issued at an election held on or before April 1, 1991, and issued before September 1, 1992, from a tax at a rate not to exceed $0.50 per $100 of valuation.
    
    (b)  A district may demonstrate the ability to comply with Subsection (a) by using the most recent taxable value of property in the district, combined with state assistance to which the district is entitled under Chapter [46](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=46) or [48](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48) that may be lawfully used for the payment of bonds.
    
    (c)  A district may demonstrate the ability to comply with Subsection (a) by using a projected future taxable value of property in the district anticipated for the earlier of the tax year five years after the current tax year or the tax year in which the final payment is due for the bonds submitted to the attorney general, combined with state assistance to which the district is entitled under Chapter [46](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=46) or [48](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48)  that may be lawfully used for the payment of bonds.  The district must submit to the attorney general a certification of the district's projected taxable value of property that is prepared by a registered professional appraiser certified under Chapter [1151](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=1151), Occupations Code, who has demonstrated professional experience in projecting taxable values of property or who can by contract obtain any necessary assistance from a person who has that experience.  To demonstrate the professional experience required by this subsection, a registered professional appraiser must provide to the district written documentation relating to two previous projects for which the appraiser projected taxable values of property.  Until the bonds submitted to the attorney general are approved or disapproved, the district must maintain the documentation and on request provide the documentation to the attorney general or comptroller.  The certification of the district's projected taxable value of property must be signed by the district's superintendent.  The attorney general must base a determination of whether the district has complied with Subsection (a) on a taxable value of property that is equal to 90 percent of the value certified under this subsection.
    
    (d)  A district that demonstrates to the attorney general that the district's ability to comply with Subsection (a) is contingent on receiving state assistance may not adopt a tax rate for a year for purposes of paying the principal of and interest on the bonds unless the district credits to the account of the interest and sinking fund of the bonds the amount of state assistance equal to the amount needed to demonstrate compliance and received or to be received in that year.
    
    (e)  If a district demonstrates to the attorney general the district's ability to comply with Subsection (a) using a projected future taxable value of property under Subsection (c) and subsequently imposes a tax to pay the principal of and interest on bonds to which Subsection (a) applies at a rate that exceeds the limit imposed by Subsection (a), the attorney general may not approve a subsequent issuance of bonds unless the attorney general finds that the district has a projected ability to pay the principal of and interest on the proposed bonds and all previously issued bonds to which Subsection (a) applies from a tax at a rate not to exceed $0.45 per $100 of valuation.

    Sec. 45.004.  REFUNDING BONDS.  (a)  In this section:
    
    (1)  "Bond" includes a note or other evidence of indebtedness.
    
    (2)  "Total debt service" means the amount of principal and unpaid interest on a bond to final maturity.
    
    (b)  Each governing board or commissioners court described by Section [45.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=45.001) may refund or refinance all or any part of any of the district's outstanding bonds and matured or unmatured but unpaid interest on those bonds payable from ad valorem taxes by issuing refunding bonds payable from ad valorem taxes.
    
    (c)  A series or issue of refunding bonds may not be issued unless:
    
    (1)  the total debt service on the refunding bonds will amount to less than the total debt service on the bonds being refunded;
    
    (2)  if a maximum interest rate was voted for the bonds being refunded, the refunding bonds do not bear interest at a rate higher than that maximum rate;  and
    
    (3)  the refunding bonds are payable from taxes of the same nature as those pledged to the payment of the obligations being refunded.
    
    (d)  Refunding bonds may be made redeemable before maturity.
    
    (e)  The refunding bonds may be:
    
    (1)  issued and delivered in lieu of, and on surrender to the comptroller and cancellation of, the obligations being refunded, and the comptroller shall register the refunding bonds and deliver them in accordance with the resolution or order authorizing the refunding bonds;  or
    
    (2)  sold for cash in any principal amounts necessary to provide all or any part of the money required to:
    
    (A)  pay the principal of any bonds being refunded and the interest to accrue on the bonds to maturity;  or
    
    (B)  redeem any bonds being refunded before maturity, including principal, any required redemption premium, and the interest to accrue on the bonds to the redemption date.
    
    (f)  The refunding may be accomplished in one or in several installment deliveries.  Refunding bonds also may be issued and delivered in accordance with any other applicable law.
    
    (g)  To refund bonds or to pay or redeem bonds in whole or in part without issuing refunding bonds, the governing board or commissioners court may deposit directly with the paying agent the proceeds from the sale of refunding bonds or any other available funds or resources.  The deposit must be in an amount sufficient, after taking into account both the principal and interest to accrue on the assets of any escrow account created under Subsection (h), to provide for the payment or redemption of the bonds and assumed obligations that are to be refunded or to be paid or redeemed.  The deposit constitutes the making of firm banking and financial arrangements for the discharge and final payment or redemption of the bonds being refunded.
    
    (h)  The governing board or commissioners court may enter into an escrow or a similar agreement with the paying agent with respect to the safekeeping, investment, reinvestment, administration, or disposition of the deposits, but the deposits may be invested and reinvested only in direct obligations of the United States, including obligations the principal of and interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed by the United States and that mature or bear interest payable at times and in amounts sufficient to provide for the scheduled payment or redemption of the bonds.  The governing board or commissioners court shall enter into an appropriate escrow or a similar agreement if any of the bonds are scheduled to be paid or redeemed on a date later than the next succeeding scheduled interest payment date.
    
    (i)  If the governing body or commissioners court has entered into an escrow or a similar agreement under Subsection (h), the refunded bonds are considered to be defeased and may not be included in or considered to be an indebtedness of the district for the purpose of a limitation on outstanding indebtedness or taxation or for any other purpose.
    
    (j)  Refunding bonds may be issued under this section to refund any bonds that are scheduled to mature or that are subject to redemption before maturity, not more than 20 years from the date of the refunding bonds.  The refunding bonds may be sold at public or private sale under the procedures, at the price, and on the terms determined by the governing board or commissioners court.  In addition, the bonds may be sold bearing interest at the rate determined by the governing board or commissioners court, but not to exceed the maximum rate prescribed by Chapter [1204](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=1204), Government Code. The governing board or commissioners court may pledge to the payment of any refunding bonds any surplus income to be available from the investment or reinvestment of any deposit made as authorized by this section or any other available revenues, income, or resources.
    
    (k)  The refunding bonds may be issued in an additional amount sufficient to pay the costs and expenses of issuing the bonds and sufficient to fund any debt service reserve, contingency, or other similar fund considered necessary or advisable by the governing board or commissioners court.

Each time the board increases the limit under Section [45.053](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=45.053)(d), the total amount of charter district bonds that may be guaranteed increases accordingly under Subsection (a).
    
    (c)  Notwithstanding Subsections (a) and (b), the commissioner may not approve charter district bonds for guarantee under this subchapter if the guarantee will result in lower bond ratings for school district bonds for which a guarantee is requested under this subchapter.
    
    (d)  The commissioner may request that the comptroller place the portion of the permanent school fund committed to the guarantee of charter district bonds in a segregated account if the commissioner determines that a separate account is needed to avoid any negative impact on the bond ratings of school district bonds for which a guarantee is requested under this subchapter.
    
    (e)  A guarantee of charter district bonds must be made in accordance with this chapter and any applicable federal law.

The amount due under this section shall be paid on receipt by the charter district of the bond proceeds.  The commissioner shall adopt rules to determine the amount due under this section.
    
    (c)  Subsection (b) does not apply if, at the time the charter district receives the proceeds of the bond guaranteed as provided by this subchapter, the balance of the charter district bond guarantee reserve fund is at least equal to three percent of the total amount of outstanding guaranteed bonds issued by charter districts. 
    
    (d)  Each year, the commissioner shall:

    Sec. 45.103.  INTEREST-BEARING TIME WARRANTS.  (a)  Any school district in need of funds to construct, repair, or renovate school buildings, purchase school buildings and school equipment, or equip school properties with necessary heating, water, sanitation, lunchroom, or electric facilities or in need of funds with which to employ a person who has special skill and experience to compile taxation data and that is financially unable out of available funds to construct, repair, renovate, or purchase school buildings, purchase school equipment, or equip school properties with necessary heating, water, sanitation, lunchroom, or electric facilities or is unable to pay the person for compiling taxation data, may, subject to this section, issue interest-bearing time warrants, in amounts sufficient to construct, purchase, equip, or improve school buildings and facilities or to pay all or part of the compensation of the person to compile taxation data, any law to the contrary notwithstanding.  The warrants shall mature in serial installments of not more than 15 years from their date of issue.  The warrants on maturity may be payable out of any available funds of the school district in the order of their maturity dates.  Any interest-bearing time warrants may be issued and sold by the district for not less than their face value, and the proceeds used to provide funds required for the purpose for which they are issued.  The warrants shall be entitled to first payment out of any available funds of the district as they become due.  Included in the purposes for which interest-bearing time warrants may be issued is the payment of any amounts owed by the school district that was incurred in carrying out any of those purposes.
    
    (a-1)  A school district may also issue interest-bearing time warrants to refund warrants previously issued under this section if the refunding warrants are coterminous with the refunded obligations.
    
    (b)  Interest-bearing time warrants may not be issued or sold by a common school district or rural high school district until they are approved by the county board of school trustees.  The board shall, on application of the school district, inquire into the financial conditions and needs of the district, and may not approve the issuance of interest-bearing time warrants unless in its opinion the district:
    
    (1)  is in need of constructing, purchasing, repairing, or renovating a school building, obtaining the school equipment, or equipping school properties with necessary heating, water, sanitation, lunchroom, or electric facilities;  and
    
    (2)  will be able with the resources in prospect to liquidate the warrants at their maturity.
    
    (c)  A school district may not issue interest-bearing time warrants in excess of five percent of the assessed valuation of the district for the year in which the warrants are issued.  The payment of interest-bearing time warrants in any one year may not exceed the anticipated surplus income of the district for the year in which the warrants are issued, based on the budget of the district for that year.  The anticipated income computed under this section is exclusive of all bond taxes.  A school district may not have outstanding at any one time warrants totaling in excess of $1 million under this section.
    
    (d)  If interest-bearing time warrants issued under this section are outstanding, the officer in charge of the collection of delinquent taxes shall pay those collections to the legal depository of the district, to be deposited and held in a special fund for the payment of the interest-bearing time warrants, and except as otherwise provided by this section, collections of delinquent taxes may not be applied or used for any other purpose.
    
    (e)  Interest and penalties on delinquent taxes are considered a part of those taxes for purposes of this section.  If any delinquent taxes, including interest and penalties, are canceled, waived, released, or reduced either by the school district or in any other way, with or without its consent, the amount of the loss sustained shall be paid by the district to the special fund provided for by Subsection (d) out of funds not otherwise pledged to that special fund.
    
    (f)  All school districts issuing interest-bearing time warrants may encumber and mortgage any property purchased with the proceeds of the warrants or any property, including teachers' residences, owned by the district to secure the payment of legally incurred obligations, except that a lien may not be placed on any school building in which actual classroom instruction of students is conducted.
    
    (g)  In this section, "interest-bearing time warrant" includes a promissory note or other evidence of indebtedness issued under this section.

    (d)  An independent school district that has in its limits a municipality with a population of 150,000 or more or that contains at least 170 square miles, has $850 million or more assessed value of taxable property on the most recent approved tax roll and has a growth in average daily attendance of 11 percent or more for each of the preceding five years as determined by the agency may, in buying school sites or additions to school sites and in building school buildings, issue and deliver negotiable or nonnegotiable notes representing all or part of the cost to the school district of the land or building.  The district may secure the notes by a vendor's lien or deed of trust lien against the land or building.  By resolution or order of the governing body made at or before the delivery of the notes, the district may set aside and appropriate as a trust fund, and the sole and only fund, for the payment of the principal of and interest on the notes that part of the local school funds, levied and collected by the school district in that year or subsequent years, as the governing body determines.  The aggregate amount of local school funds set aside in or for any subsequent year for the retirement of the notes may not exceed, in any one subsequent year, 10 percent of the local school funds collected during that year.  The district may issue the notes only if approved by majority vote of the qualified voters voting in an election conducted in the manner provided by Section [45.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=45.003) for approval of bonds.

    Sec. 45.111.  CERTIFICATES OF INDEBTEDNESS;  ISSUANCE BY CERTAIN SCHOOL AND JUNIOR COLLEGE DISTRICTS.  (a)  Any school district, including a junior college district, situated in a county with a population of 200,000 or more may issue interest-bearing certificates of indebtedness to provide funds for erecting or equipping school buildings in the boundaries of the district or refinancing outstanding certificates as provided by this section.  The term "certificates," as used in this section, includes all obligations authorized to be issued under this section and the interest on those obligations.
    
    (b)  The governing body of the district shall provide for the payment of the certificates issued under this section by appropriating and pledging local school funds derived from maintenance taxes levied and assessed under Sections 45.002 and 130.122;  Chapter 273, Acts of the 53rd Legislature, Regular Session, 1953 (Article 2784g, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes);  or other similar law that limits the amount of tax that may be levied for maintenance purposes, as distinguished from bond requirements.  The appropriation and pledge may be in the nature of a continuing irrevocable pledge to apply the first moneys collected annually from the tax levy to the payment of the obligations or by the irrevocable present levy and appropriation of the amount of the maintenance tax required to meet the annual debt service requirements of the obligations, in which event the governing body shall covenant to annually set aside the amount in the annual tax levy, showing the same is a portion of the maintenance tax.  The governing body shall annually budget the amount required to pay the principal and interest of the obligations that may be scheduled to become due in any fiscal year.  This section may not be construed as permitting the levy of a maintenance tax in excess of the amount approved by the qualified voters of the district.
    
    (c)  A district may not at any one time have certificates outstanding and unpaid in principal amount in excess of $250,000, unless the excessive amount becomes the obligation of the district by assumption under Subsection (k) or the new certificates are being issued to refund or refinance outstanding obligations under Subsection (i).
    
    (d)  The principal amount of certificates that may be authorized at any one time and the scheduling of their principal maturity are further restricted as follows:
    
    (1)  if the assessed valuation is more than $1 million and less than $15 million, the limiting factor is 25 cents;
    
    (2)  if the assessed valuation is $15 million or more but less than $35 million, the limiting factor is 15 cents;  and
    
    (3)  if the assessed valuation is $35 million or more, the limiting factor is 5 cents.
    
    (e)  Assessed valuation means the valuation for school district purposes on the tax rolls of the district most recently approved before the authorization of the certificates.  The limiting factor for a particular district, as prescribed by Subsection (d), is multiplied by the assessed valuation of the district, and the product is the maximum amount of debt service requirements on the certificates that may be scheduled to become due in any fiscal year on a cumulative basis.  A district that has an assessed valuation less than $1 million may not issue certificates under this section.
    
    (f)  Certificates authorized to be issued under this section shall be payable at the times and be in such form and denomination or denominations either in coupon form or registered as to principal, interest, or both.  The certificates may contain options for redemption before the scheduled maturity and may be payable at the place and may contain other provisions as the governing body of the district determines.  A certificate may not mature over a period in excess of 25 years from the date of the certificate or bear interest at a rate in excess of seven percent per annum.
    
    (g)  Except if issued in exchange for certificates outstanding as provided by Subsection (i), the certificates shall be sold for cash at not less than the face or par value plus accrued interest.  The proceeds shall be applied for the purpose for which the certificates were issued, except that all accrued interest and premium received, if any, shall be deposited in the interest and sinking fund established for the payment of the obligations.  The cost of issuing the obligations, including attorneys', printing, and fiscal fees, may be paid from the proceeds, except if certificates are sold under Subsection (i).
    
    (h)  The certificates, including interest whether issued in coupon or registered form, are securities within the meaning of Chapter [8](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=8), Business & Commerce Code, and that chapter applies to the certificates after their approval by the attorney general and registration by the comptroller.
    
    (i)  Each governing body may refund or refinance outstanding certificates by issuing new interest-bearing certificates within the limitations and conditions provided in this section.  The new certificates shall be issued and delivered in lieu of and on surrender to the comptroller and the cancellation of the obligations being refunded, and the comptroller shall register the new certificates and deliver them in accordance with the order authorizing their issuance.  The new certificates may be issued in accordance with Subchapter [A](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=1207.001), Chapter [1207](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=1207), Government Code, and delivered in accordance with Subchapter B or C of that chapter.
    
    (j)  A certified copy of all proceedings relating to the authorization of the certificates shall be submitted to the attorney general.
    
    (k)  Certificates issued under this section are an indebtedness of the school district issuing them, but the holder of a certificate does not have the right to demand payment out of any fund other than those pledged to its payment.  If the boundary lines of any issuing district are changed while the certificates remain outstanding, the indebtedness shall be adjusted or assumed as provided under general law for the adjustment of bond indebtedness payable from taxation.
    
    (l)  For purposes of this section, the governing body of a common school district is the commissioners court of the county having administrative jurisdiction.  The governing body of an independent school district, a rural high school district, or a junior college district is its board of trustees, and the governing body of a municipally controlled school district is the city or town council or commission.  Certificates shall be authorized by order of the governing body of the district.
