    Sec. 43.010.  DEFAULT OF SCHOOL DISTRICT SECURITIES HELD BY THE PERMANENT SCHOOL FUND.  (a)  If interest or principal has not been paid for two years or more on any bonds issued by any school district and held by the permanent school fund, the State Board of Education may:
    
    (1)  compel the district to levy a tax sufficient to meet the interest and principal payments then or later due;  or
    
    (2)  if the district furnishes to the State Board of Education satisfactory proof that the district's taxing ability is insufficient, require the district to:
    
    (A)  exhaust all legal remedies in collecting delinquent taxes;  and

    (b)  Revenue collected by either method specified by Subsection (a) shall be distributed proportionately to all owners of the defaulted securities in compliance with the following:
    
    (1)  the proportionate share for each owner is based on the interest and principal requirements of the original security before authorized refunding;  and
    
    (2)  prior acceptance of refunding securities does not reduce an owner's proportionate share.
    
    (c)  As long as any school district is delinquent in its payments of principal or interest on any of its bonds owned by the permanent school fund, the State Board of Education may specify the method of crediting payments to the state made by the district as to principal and interest.
    
    (d)  The comptroller may not issue any warrant from the foundation school fund to or for the benefit of any district that has been for as long as two years in default in the payment of principal or interest on any security owned by the permanent school fund until the State Board of Education certifies that the district has satisfactorily complied with the appropriate provisions of this section, in which event the comptroller shall resume making payments to or for the benefit of the district, including the making of pretermitted payments.

    Sec. 43.011.  AUTHORIZED REFUNDING OF DEFAULTED SCHOOL BONDS.  (a)  In compliance with this section, the State Board of Education may revise, readjust, modify, refinance, or refund defaulted bonds issued by any school district in this state and owned by either the permanent school fund or the available school fund.
    
    (b)  Application must be made to the State Board of Education by the district that issued the bonds and must show that:
    
    (1)  delinquent interest totals at least 50 percent of the principal amount of the bonds;  and
    
    (2)  taxable valuation has decreased to such an extent that a full application of the proceeds of the voted authorized tax authorized to be levied on the $100 taxable property valuation will not meet interest and principal annually maturing on the bonds.
    
    (c)  The State Board of Education may effect a refunding of the debt due and to become due only if the board finds that:
    
    (1)  the district is unable to pay the sums already matured and the sums contracted to be paid as they mature by paying annually to the State Board of Education the full proceeds of a 50-cent tax levy on the $100 of all taxable valuation of property in the district;
    
    (2)  the taxable valuation of property in the district has decreased at least 75 percent since the bonds were issued and that the decrease was not caused by the district or any of its officials;
    
    (3)  the district for a period of at least five years before applying to the State Board of Education for refunding has levied a tax of 50 cents on the $100 of taxable valuation of property in the district, and that despite such levies, the aggregate amount due the State Board of Education exceeds the aggregate amount due at the beginning of the period;
    
    (4)  the district has not authorized and sold additional bonds during the five-year period immediately preceding the application;  and
    
    (5)  the district has in good faith endeavored to pay its debt in accordance with the contract evidenced by the bonds held for the account of the permanent school fund or the available school fund.
    
    (d)  If the conditions specified by Subsection (c) are found to exist, the district is, for purposes of this section, insolvent, and the State Board of Education may exchange the bonds, interest coupons, and other evidences of indebtedness for new refunding bonds of the district issued in compliance with the following:
    
    (1)  the principal amount of the refunding bonds may not be less than the total amount of the bonds, matured interest coupons, accrued interest, and interest on delinquent interest then actually due to the permanent school fund or the available school fund;  and
    
    (2)  the rate of interest to be borne by the refunding bonds may be lower than that borne by the bonds to be refunded if in consideration of the interest reduction the district agrees to levy a tax each year for a period of 40 years at a rate sufficient to produce annually a sum equal to 90 percent of the amount that can be calculated by the levy of a tax at the rate of 50 cents on the $100 of taxable valuation of property as determined by the latest approved tax roll of the district, and in determining the rate of interest to be borne by the refunding bonds, the State Board of Education shall be governed by the following:
    
    (A)  the State Board of Education may require the rate to be a percent per annum as in its judgment will represent the maximum rate that can be paid by the district and still permit an orderly and certain retirement of the refunding bonds within 40 years from their date;
    
    (B)  the interest rate of refunding bonds to be received in exchange for bonds owned by the permanent school fund may not be less than the minimum rate at which bonds may then be purchased as investments for the permanent school fund;  and
    
    (C)  the rate of interest of refunding bonds to be received in exchange for bonds owned by the available school fund may be set by the State Board of Education at any rate the board considers feasible, and the refunding bonds may, at the discretion of the State Board of Education, be made non-interest bearing to a date fixed by the board.
    
    (e)  The State Board of Education may not make a revision, readjustment, modification, refinancing, or refunding that will release or extinguish any debt or obligation then due and payable to the permanent school fund or to the available school fund.
    
    (f)  Except as otherwise provided or permitted by this section, the refunding of the bonds of school districts authorized by this section must be in compliance with the general provisions with regard to the refunding of school district bonds.
