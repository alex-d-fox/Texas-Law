The finding must be stated in the order or resolution establishing the reduced tuition rate.

    Acts 1969, 61st Leg., p. 3004, ch. 889, Sec. 1.  Renumbered from Education Code Sec. 51.071 by Acts 1971, 62nd Leg., p. 3293, ch. 1024, art. 1, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1971.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 130.082.  GOVERNING BOARD OF JUNIOR COLLEGE OF OTHER THAN INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT.  (a)  Except as provided by Section [130.081](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=130.081) or another section of this subchapter, the governing boards of all junior college districts shall be constituted and chosen as described in the provisions of this section.
    
    (b)  The official name of the governing board of the junior college district shall be the board of trustees.
    
    (c)  The official name of a junior college district shall be the "__________ Junior College District" unless the board of trustees of the district elects to call the district a community college district, in which event the official name of the junior college district shall be the "________ Community College District."  The board shall designate an appropriate and locally pertinent descriptive word or words to be filled in the appropriate blank (and may change such designation when deemed advisable) by resolution or order;  provided that no two districts shall have the same or substantially similar names.  A district may change its name under Section [130.005](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=130.005) or [130.0051](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=130.0051).  All resolutions or orders designating or changing names shall be filed immediately with the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board and the first name filed shall have priority, and the district shall be advised of any previous filing of any identical or substantially similar name.  The name of any junior college district existing on September 1, 1997, shall remain the same until and unless it is changed under this chapter, and any change in the name of a junior college district made before that date is validated and is deemed to have been properly made.  Another district may not use the name of any district whose name change is validated under this subsection.
    
    (d)  The number of members or trustees of the governing board shall be either seven or nine, in accordance with the laws applicable to the junior college district on the effective date of this code or on the date of the creation of a new district or a new board.  Any seven-member board may be increased to nine, and the two additional members shall be appointed by resolution or order of the board for terms of office as prescribed in Subsection (e) of this section.  Any vacancy occurring on the board through death, resignation, or otherwise, shall be filled by a special election ordered by the board or by appointment by resolution or order of the board.  A person appointed to fill a vacancy in a trustee district must be a resident of that trustee district.  A person appointed to fill a vacancy in the representation of the district at large must be a resident of the district at large.  A special election to fill a board vacancy is conducted in the same manner as the district's general election except as provided by the applicable provisions of the Election Code.  The person appointed to fill the unexpired term shall serve until the next regular election of members to the board, at which time the position shall be filled by election for a term appropriately shortened to conform with what regularly would have been the length of the term for that position.  Each member of the board shall be a resident, qualified voter of the district and shall take the proper oath of office before taking up the duties thereof.  Members of a board shall not receive any remuneration or emolument of office, but they shall be entitled to reimbursement for their actual expenses incurred in performing their duties, to the extent authorized and permitted by the board.  The board shall elect one of its members as president of the board, and the president shall preside at meetings of said board and perform such other duties and functions as are prescribed by the board.  The president of the board shall have a vote the same as the other members.  The board shall elect a secretary of the board who may or may not be a member of the board, and who shall be the official custodian of the minutes, books, records, and seal of said board, and who shall perform such other duties and functions as are prescribed by the board.  The board shall be authorized to elect any other officers as deemed necessary or advisable. Officers of the board shall be elected at the first regular meeting of the board following the regular election of members of the board in even-numbered years, or at any time thereafter in order to fill a vacancy.  Said board shall be authorized to appoint or employ such agents, employees, and officials as deemed necessary or advisable to carry out any power, duty, or function of said board;  and to employ a president, dean, or other administrative officer, and upon the president's recommendation to employ faculty and other employees of the junior college.  Said board shall act and proceed by and through resolutions or orders adopted or passed by the board and the affirmative vote of a majority of all members of the board shall be required to adopt or pass a resolution or order, and the board shall adopt such rules, regulations, and bylaws as it deems advisable, not inconsistent with this section.
    
    (e)  The basic term of office of a member of the board shall be six years, and one-third of the members of the board shall be elected at large in the district at regular elections to be held on the first Saturday in April in each even-numbered year;  provided that with a seven-member board two members shall be elected in two consecutive even-numbered years and three members shall be elected in the following even-numbered year.  The members of each board in office at the effective date of this act, and all subsequent members of the board, shall remain in office until the expiration of the terms for which they were elected or appointed, and until their successors shall have been elected and qualified;  provided that where any existing board has held its regular elections for members of the board in odd-numbered years prior to the effective date of this act, the board shall nevertheless hold its next regular election on the first Saturday in April of the next even-numbered year following the effective date of this act, and the term of office of each incumbent member of the board shall, in effect, be lengthened by one year so as to comply with the foregoing provisions of this act.  Upon the creation of a new board, or in any other situation where necessary, the members of the board shall choose by lot the terms for which they shall serve, so as to comply with the foregoing provisions.  If a board is increased from seven to nine members, one of the members shall be appointed to serve until the first election at which two members otherwise would have been elected, and the other shall be appointed to serve until the second election at which two members otherwise would have been elected, and three members shall be elected for six-year terms at each election.
    
    (f)  Members of a board shall be elected at large from each junior college district at regular elections to be called and held by the board for such purpose, at the expense of the district, on the first Saturday in April in each even-numbered year.  Said elections shall be held in accordance with the Texas Election Code except as hereinafter provided, and all resident, qualified electors of the district shall be permitted to vote.  Each such election shall be called by resolution or order of the board, and notice of each such election shall be given by publishing an appropriate notice, in a newspaper of general circulation in the district, at least 10 days prior to the date of the election, setting forth the date of the election, the polling place or places, the numbers of the positions to be filled, the candidates for each position and any other matters deemed necessary or advisable.
    
    (g)  The board shall designate a number for the position held by each member of the board, from one upward in consecutive numerical order in such manner that the lowest numbers shall be assigned to the members whose terms of office expire in the shortest length of time, provided that any such position number designations on existing boards under existing law at the effective date of this act shall remain in effect.  At each election candidates shall be voted upon and be elected separately for each position on the board, and the name of each candidate shall be placed on the official ballot according to the number of the position for which he or she is running.  A candidate receiving a majority of the votes cast for all candidates for a position shall be declared elected.  If no candidate receives such a majority, then the two candidates receiving the highest number of votes shall run against each other for the position.  The run-off election for all positions shall be held on a date that complies with law and shall be ordered, notice thereof given, and held, as provided herein for regular elections.  Any resident, qualified elector of the district may have his or her name placed as a candidate on the official ballot for any position to be filled at each regular election by filing with the secretary of the board a written application therefor signed by the applicant, not later than 5 p.m. of the 45th day before the date of the election.  An application may not be filed earlier than the 30th day before the date of the filing deadline.  Such application must state the number of the position for which he or she is a candidate, or the name of the incumbent member of the board holding the position for which he or she desires to run.  The location on the ballot of the names of candidates for each position shall be chosen by lot by the board.  A candidate shall be eligible to run for only one position at each election. 
    
    (h)  Notwithstanding anything in this code to the contrary, the provisions of all or any part of the laws of this state in effect immediately prior to the effective date of this act and relating to the name of any junior college district or the name of its governing board, or to the number of members of its governing board, or the procedures and times of electing or choosing said members, shall remain in effect under the following conditions.  If, at any time before the effective date of this act (but not thereafter), the governing board of any junior college district shall specify by resolution or order the particular provisions of the aforesaid laws applicable to it which it desires to remain in effect, then such particular provisions shall continue to apply to said board and its district;  provided that at any time thereafter the governing board may make this section in its entirety applicable to it and its district by appropriate resolution or order, and thereby permanently cancel the effect of the aforesaid particular provisions of other laws.  All resolutions and orders permitted by this section shall be filed immediately with the Coordinating Board, Texas College and University System.
    
    (i)  The election of trustees of a countywide junior or community college district that contains a city with a population of more than 1.18 million located primarily in a county with a population of 2.5 million or more shall be held on the first Saturday in April of each even-numbered year.  When a runoff election is necessary, the board may order the election for a date to coincide with the date of the runoff election for city officials, if the city is holding a runoff election;  otherwise, the board shall set the date of the runoff election for not later than three weeks following the regular election.
    
    (j)  Notwithstanding the election dates prescribed by this section, an election held under this section shall be held on a uniform election date as provided by law.

    (b)  Each school district which has been annexed to the junior college district for junior colleges purposes only shall be represented by at least one member of the board of regents.  If the assessed tax rolls exceed $67,500,000, the school district shall be represented by one member of the board of regents for each $67,500,000 of assessed value, or a major fraction thereof, on the junior college tax roll, located within the school district.

    (c)  The total number of members of the board of regents of the junior college district shall never exceed 14.  When the valuation of the enlarged district increases to the point that the number of regents exceeds 14 under the formula described in Subsection (b) of this section then the board of regents of the junior college district shall set a formula, based on proportional tax values, of representation, which will produce a total of 14 members of the board of regents.
    
    (d)  The terms of office of the regents authorized by this act shall be six years.  Those regents serving as regents on May 22, 1969, shall continue in office for the remainder of their respective terms and then until such time as their successors shall have been elected and qualified, and thereafter in each even-numbered year three regents shall be elected from the area originally forming the junior college district to succeed those regents whose terms are expiring, but if the number of regents becomes more or less than nine, the formula set out in Subsection (e) of this section shall be followed.  All new regents added to the board of regents under the provisions of this section shall be appointed by the board of regents which orders the enlargement of the membership of such board, and shall serve until election specified in Subsection (e) of this section.  All vacancies on the board of regents shall be filled at once for the unexpired term only by appointments made by the remaining members of such board.
    
    (e)  Where additional regent positions are provided under the terms of this section, the board of regents at the time of such authorization shall designate by resolution duly recorded in the minutes of such board the term to be served by each such additional regent, provided that the first regent authorized and appointed shall serve only until the next regular regent election, the second such regent shall serve until the regent election two years after the next regular regent election, and the third regent shall serve until the regent election four years after the next regular regent election, with additional regents which may be authorized to follow the same rotation of terms until all terms of additional regents provided under the terms of this section have been fixed to expire at the next regular regent election, or at the regent election two years after the next regular regent election, or at the regent election four years after the next regular election.  Additional regents appointed to such terms and until such times as their successors shall have been elected and qualified, and thereafter the terms of such regents shall be for six years.
    
    (f)  Regent elections in all parts of the districts affected by the provisions of this section shall be held at the times and in the manner now provided for public junior colleges by general law.  The qualified voters residing in the school district represented shall be entitled to vote in such elections.  Each regent to be elected shall be a resident of the school district he is to represent and each regent to represent the original college district shall be a resident of the original college district.

In the authorization of any such bonds, each board may provide for the subsequent issuance of additional parity bonds, or subordinate lien bonds, or other types of bonds, under such terms or conditions as may be set forth in the resolution or order authorizing the issuance of said bonds, all within the discretion of the board.

    (d)  Each board shall be authorized to pledge all or any part of any of its revenues from any of the aforesaid rentals, rates, charges, and/or fees to the payment of any bonds issued hereunder, including the payment of principal, interest, and any other amounts required or permitted in connection with said bonds.  When any of the revenues from any such rentals, rates, charges, and/or fees are pledged to the payment of bonds, they shall be fixed and collected in such amounts as will be at least sufficient, together with any other pledged resources, to provide for all payments of principal, interest, and any other amounts required in connection with said bonds, and, to the extent required by the resolution or order authorizing the issuance of said bonds, to provide for the payment of operation, maintenance, and other expenses.  Each board shall be authorized to establish and enforce such parietal rules for students and others, and to enter into such agreements regarding occupancy, use, and availability, and the amounts and collection of pledged revenues, fees, or other resources as will assure making all said required payments.

Such specific and/or general fees may be fixed and collected and pledged to the payment of any issue or series of bonds issued hereunder, in the full amounts required or permitted herein, in addition to, and regardless of the existence of, any other specific or general fees at the institution or institutions;  provided that each board may restrict its power to pledge such additional specific or general fees in any manner that may be provided in the resolution or order authorizing the issuance of any bonds issued hereunder, and provided that no such additional specific fees shall be pledged if prohibited by any resolution or order which authorized the issuance of any then outstanding bonds issued pursuant to any Texas statute.
    
    (e)  In addition to the revenues, fees, and other resources authorized to be pledged to the payment of bonds issued hereunder, each board further shall be authorized to pledge irrevocably to such payment, out of the tuition charges required or permitted by law to be imposed at its institution or institutions, an amount not exceeding 25 percent of the tuition charges collected from each enrolled student for each semester or term, and each board also shall be authorized to pledge to such payment all or any part of any grant, donation, or income received or to be received from the United States government or any other public or private source, whether pursuant to an agreement or otherwise.

    (3)  "Governing body" means the governing board of an issuer.
    
    (4)  "Issuer" means a junior college district or a regional college district.

    (6)  "Project costs" means all costs and expenses incurred in relation to an eligible project, including without limitation design, planning, engineering, and legal costs, acquisition costs of land, interest in land, rights-of-way, and easements, construction costs, costs of machinery, equipment, and other capital assets incident and related to the operation, maintenance, and administration of an eligible project, and financing costs, including interest during construction and thereafter, underwriter's discount and fees for legal, financial, and other professional services.  Project costs attributable to an eligible project and incurred prior to the issuance of any obligations issued to finance an eligible project may be reimbursed from the proceeds of sale of obligations.
    
    (b)  The governing body of an issuer is hereby authorized and empowered to issue, sell, and deliver obligations and execute credit agreements in order to finance project costs of an eligible project or to refund obligations issued in connection with an eligible project, subject to the limitations contained herein.  Obligations shall be secured solely by:  (1) the proceeds of sale of other obligations;  (2) any revenues which the issuer is authorized by any statute or constitutional provision to pledge to the payment of any obligations;  or (3) any one or more of such sources, including credit agreements, all as the governing body of the issuer shall provide in the resolution or order authorizing the issuance of the obligations.  Obligations shall be repaid from the source or sources securing the payment thereof, funds received from a credit agreement, or from any other revenues otherwise legally available for the payment thereof, except funds derived from ad valorem taxation.
    
    (c)  The issuance of obligations shall be authorized by resolution or order of the governing body of an issuer, which resolution or order shall fix the maximum amount of obligations to be issued or, if applicable, the maximum principal amount which may be outstanding at any time, the maximum term obligations issued and delivered pursuant to such authorization shall be outstanding, the maximum interest rate to be borne by the obligations (within the limitations of Chapter [1204](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=1204), Government Code), the manner of sale (which may be by either public or private sale), price, form, terms, conditions, and covenants thereof.  The resolution or order authorizing the issuance of obligations may provide for the designation of a paying agent and registrar for the obligations and may authorize one or more designated officers or employers of the issuer to act on behalf of the issuer from time to time in the selling and delivering of obligations authorized and fixing the dates, price, interest rates, interest payment periods, and other procedures as may be specified in the resolution or order.  Obligations may be issued in such form or such denomination, payable at such time or times, in such amount or amounts or installments, at such place or places, in such form, under such terms, conditions, and details, in such manner, redeemable prior to maturity at any time or times, bearing no interest, or bearing interest at any rate or rates (either fixed, variable, floating, adjustable, or otherwise, all as determined in accordance with the resolution or order providing for the issuance of the obligations, which resolution or order may provide a formula, index, contract, or any other arrangement for the periodic determination of interest rates), not to exceed the maximum net effective interest rate allowed by law and may be signed or otherwise executed in such manner, with manual or facsimile signatures, and with or without a seal, all as shall be specified by the governing body of the issuer in the resolution or order authorizing the issuance of the obligations.  The proceeds received from the sale of obligations may be deposited or invested in any manner and in such obligations as may be specified in the resolution or order or other proceedings authorizing the obligations.  In the event any officer or officers whose signatures are on any obligations cease to be such officer or officers before the delivery thereof to the purchaser, such signature or signatures shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes and the successor or successors in office of any such officers shall be fully authorized to complete the execution, authentication, or delivery of said obligations to the purchaser or purchasers thereof.
    
    (d)  The governing body of an issuer may enter into credit agreements in conjunction with the issuance, payment, sale, resale, or exchange of obligations to enhance the security for or provide for the payment, redemption, or remarketing of the obligations and interest on the obligations or to reduce the interest payable on the obligations.  A credit agreement is an agreement for professional services and shall contain the terms and conditions and be for the period that the governing body of the issuer approves.  The cost to the issuer of the credit agreement may be paid from the proceeds of the sale of the obligations to which the credit agreement relates or from any other source, including revenues of the issuer that are available for the purpose of paying the obligations and the interest on the obligations or that may otherwise be legally available to make those payments.
    
    (e)  Obligations, including accrued interest, may from time to time be refinanced, renewed, or refunded by the issuance of other obligations.  Credit agreements entered into by an issuer, whether pursuant to the provisions of this section or not, may be refinanced, renewed, refunded, or otherwise terminated and a new credit agreement substituted therefor by amendment to the proceedings which authorized such credit agreements and, if required to accomplish the substitution of credit agreements, outstanding bonds may be refunded with obligations.
    
    (f)  Preliminary to the issuance and delivery of obligations, the resolution or order authorizing the issuance thereof, together with any credit agreements and any contracts providing revenues and security to pay the obligations, shall be submitted to the attorney general for his review.  If the attorney general shall find that such credit agreement or agreements, if any, contracts, if any, and other authorizing proceedings conform to the requirements of the Texas Constitution and this section, the attorney general shall approve them.  Thereafter, the authorized obligations may be executed and delivered, exchanged, or refinanced from time to time in accordance with the authorizing proceedings.  Upon such approval by the attorney general and initial delivery of any obligations so authorized, any such credit agreements, any such contracts providing revenues or security, such initial obligations, and all other obligations thereafter issued pursuant to the authorizing proceedings shall be incontestable for any cause in any court or other forum and shall be valid and binding obligations enforceable in accordance with their respective terms and provisions.
    
    (f-1)  The governing body of an "eligible issuer" may enter into credit agreements as described in Subsection (d).  As used in this subsection, "eligible issuer" means an issuer that prior to the effective date of this subsection (i) issued bonds which, prior to or simultaneously with the delivery thereof, were rated by a nationally recognized rating agency for municipal securities in one of the four highest ranking categories for long-term obligations, and (ii) reserved in the resolution or order authorizing issuance of the bonds the right, in the event of a change in state law, to substitute a credit agreement in lieu of cash and investments in a reserve fund established pursuant to the resolution or order.
    
    (g)  All obligations issued by an issuer shall constitute negotiable instruments and are investment securities governed by Chapter [8](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=8), Business & Commerce Code, notwithstanding any provisions of law or court decision to the contrary and are legal and authorized investments for banks, savings banks, trust companies, building and loan associations, savings and loan associations, insurance companies, fiduciaries, and trustees and for the sinking funds of cities, towns, villages, school districts, and other political subdivisions or public agencies of the State of Texas.  Said obligations also are eligible to secure deposits of any public funds of the state or any political subdivision or public agency of the state and are lawful and sufficient security for the deposits to the extent of their market value.
    
    (h)  This section shall be construed liberally to effectuate the legislative intent and purposes of this section and all powers herein granted shall be broadly interpreted to effectuate such intent and purposes and not as a limitation of powers.
    
    (i)  In case any one or more of the provisions, clauses, or words of this section or the application of such provisions, clauses, or words to any situation or circumstance shall for any reason be held to be invalid or unconstitutional, such invalidity or unconstitutionality shall not affect any other provisions, clauses, or words of this section or the application of such provisions, clauses, or words to any other situation or circumstance, and it is intended that this section shall be severable and shall be construed and applied as if any such invalid or unconstitutional provision, clause, or word had not been included herein.
    
    (j)  This section shall be cumulative of all other laws on the subject, but this section shall be wholly sufficient authority within itself for the issuance of obligations and the performance of the other acts and procedures authorized hereby, or under any agreement, without reference to any other laws or any restrictions or limitations contained herein.  To the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between any provisions of this section and any provisions of any other law, the provisions of this section shall prevail and control;  provided, however, that any issuer shall have the right to use the provisions of any other laws not in conflict with the provisions hereof to the extent convenient or necessary to carry out any power or authority, express or implied, granted by this section.
    
    (k)  When the governing body of any issuer provides in the resolution or order or other proceedings authorizing the issuance of any bond, any credit agreement, or any other agreement for a pledge or lien on revenues, income, or other resources of the issuer, or the assets of the issuer, or any fund maintained by the issuer to secure payment of the obligations or to secure payments required by a credit agreement or any other agreement, such pledge or lien shall be valid and binding in accordance with its terms without further action on the part of the issuer and without any filing or recording with respect thereto except in the records of the issuer.  All such liens and pledges shall be perfected from the time of payment for and delivery of the obligations and the credit agreement or other agreement until the obligations or other payments, including those under the credit agreement, have been paid or payment of the obligations has been provided for or the terms of the credit agreement or other agreement have been satisfied in accordance with their respective terms and such lien shall be fully perfected as to items then on hand and thereafter received until the satisfaction of such obligations, and said items shall be subject to such liens or pledges without any physical delivery thereof or further act.  Nothing contained in this section shall relieve any issuer of any obligation to file or record any lien on realty or submit any issue of obligations for approval by the attorney general and registration by the comptroller of public accounts.

    SUBCHAPTER K.  BRANCH CAMPUSES
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 130.251.  BRANCH CAMPUSES.  (a) The board of trustees of a junior college district may establish and operate branch campuses, centers, or extension facilities within the junior college district's service area, provided that each branch campus, center, or extension facility and each course or program offered in such locations is subject to the prior and continuing approval of the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.
    
    (b)  Such branch campuses, centers, or extension facilities shall be within the role and scope of the junior college as determined by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.
    
    (c)  The board of trustees of a junior college district may accept or acquire by purchase or rent land and facilities in the name of the junior college district within the junior college district's service area.
    
    (d)  Before any course may be offered by a public junior college within the service area of another operating public junior college, it must be established that the second public junior college is not capable of or is unable to offer the course. After the need is established and the course is not locally available, then the first public junior college may offer the course when approval is granted by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.
    
    (d-1)  Subsection (d) does not apply to a course offered by a public junior college with a service area located wholly or partly in a county with a population of more than three million for high school students enrolled in a school district located wholly or partly in a county with a population of more than three million.
    
    (e)  The board of trustees of a junior college district may enter cooperative agreement with independent, common, or county school districts, state or federal agencies as may be required to perform the services as outlined in this section.
    
    (f)  Notwithstanding Subchapter J, the service area of a junior college district does not include territory within the boundaries of the taxing district of another junior college district.  If a branch campus, center, or extension facility operated by a junior college district outside its taxing district becomes located within the taxing district of another junior college district when the other district is established or annexes the territory that includes the campus, center, or facility, the junior college district operating the campus, center, or facility must discontinue the campus, center, or facility within a reasonable period, not to exceed one academic year.  The junior college district in which the campus, center, or facility is located must fairly compensate the junior college district that discontinues the campus, center, or facility for any capital improvements that the discontinuing district acquired or constructed for the campus, center, or facility, to the extent the discontinuing district is otherwise unable to recover the current value of its investment in that capital improvement, as determined by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.
    
    (g)  Subsections (a) and (c) do not apply to a branch campus, center, or extension facility that is established before September 1, 1999.
    
    (h)  This section does not affect the authority of the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board regarding the continued operation of a branch campus, center, or extension facility.

    (c)  The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board shall determine whether the requirements provided by Subsections (a) and (b) have been satisfied and whether the proposed tax is feasible and desirable under the coordinating board's rules for junior colleges.

The commissioner of higher education shall deliver to the governing body of the school district or county, as applicable, the order of the coordinating board authorizing or denying further action in the levying of a junior college district branch campus maintenance tax.

In the case of joint school district or joint county elections, by mutual agreement of the governing bodies, the elections shall be held on the same date throughout the jurisdictions.
