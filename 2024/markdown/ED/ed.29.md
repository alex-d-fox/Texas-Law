    Sec. 29.001.  STATEWIDE PLAN.  The agency shall develop, and modify as necessary, a statewide design, consistent with federal law, for the delivery of services to children with disabilities in this state that includes rules for the administration and funding of the special education program so that a free appropriate public education is available to all of those children between the ages of three and 21.  The statewide design shall include the provision of services primarily through school districts and shared services arrangements, supplemented by regional education service centers.  The agency shall also develop and implement a statewide plan with programmatic content that includes procedures designed to:
    
    (1)  ensure state compliance with requirements for supplemental federal funding for all state-administered programs involving the delivery of instructional or related services to students with disabilities;
    
    (2)  facilitate interagency coordination when other state agencies are involved in the delivery of instructional or related services to students with disabilities;
    
    (3)  periodically assess statewide personnel needs in all areas of specialization related to special education and pursue strategies to meet those needs through a consortium of representatives from regional education service centers, local education agencies, and institutions of higher education and through other available alternatives;
    
    (4)  ensure that regional education service centers throughout the state maintain a regional support function, which may include direct service delivery and a component designed to facilitate the placement of students with disabilities who cannot be appropriately served in their resident districts;
    
    (5)  allow the agency to effectively monitor and periodically conduct site visits of all school districts to ensure that rules adopted under this section are applied in a consistent and uniform manner, to ensure that districts are complying with those rules, and to ensure that annual statistical reports filed by the districts and not otherwise available through the Public Education Information Management System under Sections [48.008](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.008) and [48.009](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.009) are accurate and complete;
    
    (6)  ensure that appropriately trained personnel are involved in the diagnostic and evaluative procedures operating in all districts and that those personnel routinely serve on district admissions, review, and dismissal committees;
    
    (7)  ensure that an individualized education program for each student with a disability is properly developed, implemented, and maintained in the least restrictive environment that is appropriate to meet the student's educational needs;
    
    (8)  ensure that, when appropriate, each student with a disability is provided an opportunity to participate in career and technology and physical education classes, in addition to participating in regular or special classes;
    
    (9)  ensure that each student with a disability is provided necessary related services;
    
    (10)  ensure that an individual assigned to act as a surrogate parent for a child with a disability, as provided by 20 U.S.C. Section 1415(b), is required to:
    
    (A)  complete a training program that complies with minimum standards established by agency rule;
    
    (B)  visit the child and the child's school;

    (D)  review the child's educational records;
    
    (E)  attend meetings of the child's admission, review, and dismissal committee;
    
    (F)  exercise independent judgment in pursuing the child's interests; and
    
    (G)  exercise the child's due process rights under applicable state and federal law; and
    
    (11)  ensure that each district develops a process to be used by a teacher who instructs a student with a disability in a regular classroom setting:
    
    (A)  to request a review of the student's individualized education program;
    
    (B)  to provide input in the development of the student's individualized education program;
    
    (C)  that provides for a timely district response to the teacher's request; and

    Sec. 29.008.  CONTRACTS FOR SERVICES;  RESIDENTIAL PLACEMENT.  (a)  A school district, shared services arrangement unit, or regional education service center may contract with a public or private facility, institution, or agency inside or outside of this state for the provision of services to students with disabilities.  Each contract for residential placement must be approved by the commissioner.  The commissioner may approve a residential placement contract only after at least a programmatic evaluation of personnel qualifications, adequacy of physical plant and equipment, and curriculum content.  The commissioner may approve either the whole or a part of a facility or program.
    
    (b)  Except as provided by Subsection (c), costs of an approved contract for residential placement may be paid from a combination of federal, state, and local funds.  The local share of the total contract cost for each student is that portion of the local tax effort that exceeds the district's local fund assignment under Section [48.256](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.256), divided by the average daily attendance in the district.  If the contract involves a private facility, the state share of the total contract cost is that amount remaining after subtracting the local share.  If the contract involves a public facility, the state share is that amount remaining after subtracting the local share from the portion of the contract that involves the costs of instructional and related services.  For purposes of this subsection, "local tax effort" means the total amount of money generated by taxes imposed for debt service and maintenance and operation less any amounts paid into a tax increment fund under Chapter [311](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=311), Tax Code.
    
    (c)  When a student, including one for whom the state is managing conservator, is placed primarily for care or treatment reasons in a private residential facility that operates its own private education program, none of the costs may be paid from public education funds.  If a residential placement primarily for care or treatment reasons involves a private residential facility in which the education program is provided by the school district, the portion of the costs that includes appropriate education services, as determined by the school district's admission, review, and dismissal committee, shall be paid from state and federal education funds.
    
    (d)  A district that contracts for the provision of education services rather than providing the services itself shall oversee the implementation of the student's individualized education program and shall annually reevaluate the appropriateness of the arrangement.  An approved facility, institution, or agency with whom the district contracts shall periodically report to the district on the services the student has received or will receive in accordance with the contract as well as diagnostic or other evaluative information that the district requires in order to fulfill its obligations under this subchapter.

The monitoring system must provide for ongoing analysis of district special education data and of complaints filed with the agency concerning special education services and for inspections of school districts at district facilities.  The agency shall use the information obtained through analysis of district data and from the complaints management system to determine the appropriate schedule for and extent of the inspection.
    
    (b)  To complete the inspection, the agency must obtain information from parents and teachers of students in special education programs in the district.
    
    (c)  The agency shall develop and implement a system of sanctions for school districts whose most recent monitoring visit shows a failure to comply with major requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. Section 1400 et seq.), federal regulations, state statutes, or agency requirements necessary to carry out federal law or regulations or state law relating to special education.
    
    (d)  For districts that remain in noncompliance for more than one year, the first stage of sanctions shall begin with annual or more frequent monitoring visits.  Subsequent sanctions may range in severity up to the withholding of funds.  If funds are withheld, the agency may use the funds to provide, through alternative arrangements, services to students and staff members in the district from which the funds are withheld.
    
    (e)  The agency's complaint management division shall develop a system for expedited investigation and resolution of complaints concerning a district's failure to provide special education or related services to a student eligible to participate in the district's special education program.

    SUBCHAPTER B. BILINGUAL EDUCATION AND SPECIAL LANGUAGE PROGRAMS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 29.051.  STATE POLICY.  English is the basic language of this state.  Public schools are responsible for providing a full opportunity for all students to become competent in speaking, reading, writing, and comprehending the English language.  Large numbers of students in the state come from environments in which the primary language is other than English.  Experience has shown that public school classes in which instruction is given only in English are often inadequate for the education of those students.  The mastery of basic English language skills is a prerequisite for effective participation in the state's educational program.  Bilingual education and special language programs can meet the needs of those students and facilitate their integration into the regular school curriculum.  Therefore, in accordance with the policy of the state to ensure equal educational opportunity to every student, and in recognition of the educational needs of emergent bilingual students, this subchapter provides for the establishment of bilingual education and special language programs in the public schools and provides supplemental financial assistance to help school districts meet the extra costs of the programs.

    Sec. 29.056.  ENROLLMENT OF STUDENTS IN PROGRAM.  (a)  The agency shall establish standardized criteria for the identification, assessment, and classification of emergent bilingual students eligible for entry into the program or exit from the program.  The student's parent must approve a student's entry into the program, exit from the program, or placement in the program.  The school district or parent may appeal the decision under Section [29.064](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=29.064).  The criteria for identification, assessment, and classification may include:
    
    (1)  results of a home language survey conducted within four weeks of each student's enrollment to determine the language normally used in the home and the language normally used by the student, conducted in English and the home language, signed by the student's parents if the student is in kindergarten through grade 8 or by the student if the student is in grades 9 through 12, and kept in the student's permanent folder by the language proficiency assessment committee;
    
    (2)  the results of an agency-approved English language proficiency test administered to all students identified through the home survey as normally speaking a language other than English to determine the level of English language proficiency, with students in kindergarten or grade 1 being administered an oral English proficiency test and students in grades 2 through 12 being administered an oral and written English proficiency test; and
    
    (3)  the results of an agency-approved proficiency test in the primary language administered to all students identified under Subdivision (2) as being of limited English proficiency to determine the level of primary language proficiency, with students in kindergarten or grade 1 being administered an oral primary language proficiency test and students in grades 2 through 12 being administered an oral and written primary language proficiency test.
    
    (b)  Tests under Subsection (a) shall be administered by professionals or paraprofessionals with the appropriate English and primary language skills and the training required by the test publisher.
    
    (c)  The language proficiency assessment committee may classify a student as emergent bilingual if:
    
    (1)  the student's ability in English is so limited or the student's disabilities are so severe that assessment procedures cannot be administered;
    
    (2)  the student's score or relative degree of achievement on the agency-approved English proficiency test is below the levels established by the agency as indicative of reasonable proficiency;
    
    (3)  the student's primary language proficiency score as measured by an agency-approved test is greater than the student's proficiency in English; or
    
    (4)  the language proficiency assessment committee determines, based on other information, including a teacher evaluation, parental viewpoint, or student interview, that the student's primary language proficiency is greater than the student's proficiency in English or that the student is not reasonably proficient in English.
    
    (d)  Not later than the 10th day after the date of the student's classification as an emergent bilingual student, the language proficiency assessment committee shall give written notice of the classification to the student's parent.  The notice must be in English and the parent's primary language.  The parents of students eligible to participate in the required bilingual education program shall be informed of the benefits of the bilingual education or special language program and that it is an integral part of the school program.
    
    (e)  The language proficiency assessment committee may retain, for documentation purposes, all records obtained under this section.
    
    (f)  The district may not refuse to provide instruction in a language other than English to a student solely because the student has a disability.
    
    (g)  A district may transfer an emergent bilingual student out of a bilingual education or special language program for the first time or a subsequent time if the student is able to participate equally in a regular all-English instructional program as determined by:
    
    (1)  agency-approved tests administered at the end of each school year to determine the extent to which the student has developed oral and written language proficiency and specific language skills in English;
    
    (2)  satisfactory performance on the reading assessment instrument under Section [39.023](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39.023)(a) or an English language arts assessment instrument under Section [39.023](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39.023)(c), as applicable, with the assessment instrument administered in English, or, if the student is enrolled in the first or second grade, an achievement score at or above the 40th percentile in the reading and language arts sections of an English standardized test approved by the agency; and
    
    (3)  agency-approved criterion-referenced tests and the results of a subjective teacher evaluation.
    
    (h)  If later evidence suggests that a student who has been transferred out of a bilingual education or special language program has inadequate English proficiency and achievement, the language proficiency assessment committee may reenroll the student in the program.  Classification of students for reenrollment must be based on the criteria required by this section.

The commissioner shall allow accumulations of hours of instruction for students whose schedule would not otherwise allow full state funding.  Funding under this subsection shall be determined based on the number of instructional days in the school district calendar and a seven-hour school day, but attendance may be cumulated over a school year, including any summer or vacation session.

    (c)  A school district, regional education service center, institution of higher education, local government, local workforce development board, or community organization may develop one or more coordination-of-resources demonstration projects under which government-funded child-care and early education services, including Head Start and Early Head Start, prekindergarten, and after-school child-care program services, child-care services provided by nonprofit or for-profit entities, and faith-based child-care programs, are operated in a coordinated and integrated manner.  An entity that develops a proposed demonstration project under this subsection must obtain approval of the project from the state agency or agencies with regulatory jurisdiction over the subject matter involved in the project.  Approval of a project under this subsection must be made contingent on development of a memorandum of understanding regarding the child-care and early education coordination and integration that is:
    
    (1)  entered into by each entity participating in the project;
    
    (2)  certified by the State Center for Early Childhood Development as meeting any standards developed under Section [29.155](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=29.155)(g); and
    
    (3)  consistent with the applicable provisions of this section and applicable laws and regulations in a manner that at a minimum maintains existing child-care and early education program requirements and does not waive any existing health and safety standards.
    
    (c-1)  The memorandum of understanding required under Subsection (c) shall provide for:
    
    (1)  equal decision-making authority for entities participating in the project;

    (5)  alignment and coordination of program calendars;
    
    (6)  delineation of responsibilities for the provision of instructional supplies and materials and food services;
    
    (7)  development and implementation of a system by which eligible children are referred for services among the participating entities in a manner that complies with applicable laws and regulations;
    
    (8)  periodic meetings of the participating entities to address concerns relating to the administration and operation of the project; and
    
    (9)  periodic meetings of the participating entities to address common standards for the professional development of program staff and to create opportunities to ensure that local communities have effective program staff.
    
    (c-2)  A demonstration project established under Subsection (c) must include a program evaluation component that, in addition to assessing child-care and early education outcomes for young children, demonstrates:
    
    (1)  the extent to which program quality has been enhanced;
    
    (2)  the extent to which the number of children being served by full-day, full-year programs has increased;
    
    (3)  the extent to which professional development training or activities engaged in by program staff has increased; and
    
    (4)  that there has been no weakening of standards or diminishment of services.
    
    (d)  An entity that obtains approval of a coordination-of-resources demonstration project is entitled to a waiver or modification of any existing rule, policy, or procedure of the agency, the Texas Workforce Commission, or the Department of Protective and Regulatory Services that impairs the coordinated provision of government-funded child-care services, provided that the waiver or modification does not adversely affect the health, safety, or welfare of the children receiving services under the project.  In addition, if applicable, the appropriate state agency must seek on behalf of the entity any available federal waiver from a federal rule, policy, or procedure imposed in connection with a Head Start program that impairs the coordinated provision of government-funded child-care services.  Not later than the 30th day after the date on which a state agency becomes aware of an applicable federal waiver under this subsection, the state agency shall notify the appropriate entity of the date by which the state agency intends to seek the waiver.
