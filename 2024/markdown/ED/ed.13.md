If territory from one district is annexed to another or if a district is abolished, the commissioners court shall also equitably allocate among the receiving districts a portion of the personal property of the annexed district or all the personal property of an abolished district.  If districts located in more than one county are involved, the commissioners court of each county in which an involved school district is located must agree on the allocation of indebtedness and personal property.
    
    (b)  In allocating the indebtedness and personal property, the commissioners court shall consider the value of the properties involved and the taxable value of the districts involved.
    
    (c)  The order of the commissioners court is binding on the school districts and territory affected by the order.
    
    (d)  A school district required to assume the indebtedness of another district under this chapter is not required to conduct an election on assumption of the indebtedness.

    (b)  On the effective date of the transfer:
    
    (1)  students residing in the territory become residents of the receiving district;
    
    (2)  title to property allocated to the receiving district vests in the district;

    (b)  Conversion of a common school district or rural high school district to an independent school district or separation from municipal control does not affect the taxes levied for school purposes.

    SUBCHAPTER B. DETACHMENT;  ANNEXATION
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 13.051.  DETACHMENT AND ANNEXATION OF TERRITORY.  (a)  In accordance with this section, territory may be detached from a school district and annexed to another school district that is contiguous to the detached territory.  A petition requesting the detachment and annexation must be presented to the board of trustees of the district from which the territory is to be detached and to the board of trustees of the district to which the territory is to be annexed.  Each board of trustees to which a petition is required to be presented must conduct a hearing and adopt a resolution as provided by this section for the annexation to be effective.
    
    (b)  The petition requesting detachment and annexation must:
    
    (1)  be signed by a majority of:
    
    (A)  the registered voters residing in the territory to be detached and annexed, if the territory has residents;  or
    
    (B)  the surface owners of taxable property in the territory to be detached and annexed, if the territory does not have residents;  and
    
    (2)  give the metes and bounds of the territory to be detached and annexed.
    
    (c)  Territory that does not have residents may be detached from a school district and annexed to another school district if:
    
    (1)  the total taxable value of the property in the territory according to the most recent certified appraisal roll for each school district is not greater than:
    
    (A)  five percent of the district's taxable value of all property in that district as determined under Subchapter [M](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=403.301), Chapter [403](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=403), Government Code; and
    
    (B)  $5,000 property value per student in average daily attendance as determined under Section [48.005](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.005); and
    
    (2)  the school district from which the property will be detached does not own any real property located in the territory.
    
    (d)  The proposed annexation must be approved by the board of trustees of each affected district, subject to the appeal provisions of Subsection (j).
    
    (e)  Unless the petition is signed by a majority of the trustees of the district from which the territory is to be detached, territory that has residents may not be detached from a school district under this section if detachment would reduce that district's tax base by a ratio at least twice as large as the ratio by which it would reduce its membership.  The first ratio is determined by dividing the assessed value of taxable property in the affected territory by the assessed value of all taxable property in the district, both figures according to the preceding year's tax rolls.  The second ratio is determined by dividing the number of students residing in the affected territory by the number of students residing in the district as a whole, using membership on the last day of the preceding school year and the students' places of residence as of that date.
    
    (f)  A school district may not be reduced to an area of less than nine square miles.
    
    (g)  Immediately following receipt of the petition as required by this section, each affected board of trustees shall give notice of the contemplated change by publishing and posting a notice in the manner required for an election order under Section [13.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=13.003).  The notice must specify the place and date at which a hearing on the matter shall be held.  Unless the districts hold a joint hearing, the districts must hold hearings on separate dates.  At each hearing, affected persons are entitled to an opportunity to be heard.
    
    (h)  At the hearing, each board of trustees shall consider the educational interests of the current students residing or future students expected to reside in the affected territory and in the affected districts and the social, economic, and educational effects of the proposed boundary change.  After the conclusion of the hearing, each board of trustees shall make findings as to the educational interests of the current students residing or future students expected to reside in the affected territory and in the affected districts and as to the social, economic, and educational effects of the proposed boundary change and shall, on the basis of those findings, adopt a resolution approving or disapproving the petition.  The findings and resolution shall be recorded in the minutes of each affected board of trustees and shall be reported to the commissioners court of the county to which the receiving district is assigned for administrative purposes by the agency and to the commissioners court of the county to which the district from which territory is to be detached is assigned for administrative purposes.
    
    (i)  If both boards of trustees of the affected districts approve the petition, the commissioners court or commissioners courts to whom the matter is required to be reported shall enter an order redefining the boundaries of the districts affected by the transfer.  Title to all real property of the district from which territory is detached within the territory annexed vests in the receiving district, and the receiving district assumes and is liable for any portion of the indebtedness of the district from which the territory is to be detached that is allocated to the receiving district under Section [13.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=13.004).
    
    (j)  If both boards of trustees of the affected districts disapprove the petition, the decisions may not be appealed.  If the board of trustees of only one affected district disapproves the petition, an aggrieved party to the proceedings in either district may appeal the board's decision to the commissioner under Section [7.057](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=7.057).  An appeal under this subsection is de novo.  In deciding the appeal, the commissioner shall consider the educational interests of the students in the affected territory and the affected districts and the social, economic, and educational effects of the proposed boundary change.
    
    (k)  Any additional tax resulting from a change of use, as provided for by Chapter [23](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=23), Tax Code, and the interest and penalty on the additional tax, that is imposed for any year on land in the annexed territory shall be paid to the school district that imposed the tax.

    Sec. 13.052.  DORMANT SCHOOL DISTRICTS.  (a)  If the commissioner determines that a school district has failed to operate a school for a full school year, the commissioner shall report to each appropriate commissioners court that the district is dormant.
    
    (b)  The commissioners court of a county shall by order annex each dormant school district within the county with an adjoining district or districts.  If the dormant district is a county-line district, the commissioners court of each county in which the district is located shall annex the territory of the dormant district that is within that county.  The commissioners court may annex territory to a school district only if the board of trustees of that district approves the annexation.
    
    (c)  The governing board of the district to which a dormant school district is annexed is the governing board for the new district.
    
    (d)  The order of the commissioners court shall define by legal boundary description the territory of the new district as enlarged and shall be recorded in the minutes of the commissioners court.
    
    (e)  Title to the real property of the dormant district vests in the district to which the property is annexed.  Each district to which territory is annexed assumes and is liable for any portion of the dormant district's indebtedness that is allocated to the receiving district under Section [13.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=13.004).

At any time it is determined that there is territory located in a county but not within the described limits of a school district, the commissioners court shall annex the territory to one or more adjoining districts.
    
    (b)  The annexation order shall define by legal boundary description the territory of the new district and shall be recorded in the minutes of the commissioners court.

    Sec. 13.054.  ACADEMICALLY UNACCEPTABLE SCHOOL DISTRICTS.  (a)  The commissioner by order may annex to one or more adjoining districts a school district that has been rated as academically unacceptable for a period of two years.
    
    (b)  The governing board of a district to which territory of an academically unacceptable district is annexed is the governing board for the new district.
    
    (c)  The order of the commissioner shall define by legal boundary description the territory of the new district as enlarged.
    
    (d)  Title to the real property of the academically unacceptable district vests in the district to which the property is annexed.  Each district to which territory is annexed assumes and is liable for any portion of the academically unacceptable district's indebtedness that is allocated to the receiving district under Section [13.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=13.004).
    
    (e)  Before the commissioner orders an annexation under this section, the commissioner shall investigate the educational and financial impact of the annexation on the receiving district.  The commissioner may order the annexation only if the commissioner finds that the annexation will not substantially impair the ability of the receiving district to educate the students located in the district before the annexation and to meet its financial obligations incurred before the annexation.
    
    (f)  For five years beginning with the school year in which the annexation occurs, a school district shall receive additional funding under this subsection or Subsection (h). The amount of funding shall be determined by multiplying the lesser of the enlarged district's local fund assignment computed under Section [48.256](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.256) or the enlarged district's total cost of tier one by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of students residing in the territory annexed to the receiving district preceding the date of the annexation and the denominator of which is the number of students residing in the district as enlarged on the date of the annexation, and multiplying the resulting product by the quotient of the enlarged district's maximum compressed tax rate, as determined under Section [48.2551](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.2551), for the current school year divided by the receiving district's maximum compressed tax rate, as determined under Section [48.2551](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.2551), for the year in which the annexation occurred.
    
    (g)  In order to assist with the costs of facility renovation, repair, and replacement, a district to which territory is annexed under this section is entitled to additional state aid for five years, beginning with the school year in which the annexation occurs.  The commissioner shall determine the amount of additional state aid provided each year by dividing the amount of debt service taxes received by the district during the tax year preceding the tax year in which the annexation occurs by the number of students enrolled in the district immediately preceding the date of annexation, and multiplying that result by the number of additional students enrolled in the district on September 1 after the date of annexation.  The commissioner shall provide additional state aid under this subsection from funds appropriated for purposes of the Foundation School Program.  A determination by the commissioner under this subsection is final and may not be appealed.
    
    (h)  The commissioner may authorize a district to receive payments provided by Subchapter G, instead of Subsection (f), if the commissioner determines that would result in greater payments for the district.  A determination by the commissioner is final and may not be appealed.
    
    (i)  The funding provided under Subsection (f), (g), or (h) is in addition to other funding the district receives through other provisions of this code, including Chapters [48](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48) and [49](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=49).
