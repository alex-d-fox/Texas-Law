    (c)  If within the three-year record retention period the commission requests the production of records required under Subsection (a), a failure to produce the records for the commission by the person claiming an exemption for the course creates a rebuttable legal presumption that the course is not exempt from this chapter.

    (5)   refunds of items of extra expense to the student, such as instructional supplies, books, student activities, laboratory fees, service charges, rentals, deposits, and all other such ancillary miscellaneous charges, where these items are separately stated and shown in the data furnished the student before enrollment, will be made in a reasonable manner acceptable to the commission;

    (1)  refunds are based on the period of enrollment computed on the basis of course or program time;
    
    (2)  the effective date of termination for refund purposes is the earlier of:

    (h)  A closing career school or college shall, subject to  Section [132.242](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=132.242), make a full refund to each student of the school or college who is owed a refund under this section.
