The institution or medical and dental unit may not delay a refund under this subsection on the grounds that the student may withdraw from the institution or unit later in the semester or term.
    
    (a-1)  An institution may assess a nonrefundable $15 matriculation fee if the student withdraws from the institution before the first day of classes.
    
    (b)  Except as provided by Subsections (b-1) and (b-2), a general academic teaching institution or medical and dental unit shall refund from the amount paid by a student withdrawing from the institution or unit an amount equal to the product of the amount of tuition and mandatory fees charged for each course in which the student is enrolled on the date the student withdraws multiplied by the applicable percentage derived from the following tables:
    
    (1)  if the student withdraws during a fall or spring semester or a summer term of 10 weeks or longer:

    (b-1)  If a student has not paid the total amount of the tuition and mandatory fees charged to the student by the institution or unit for the courses in which the student is enrolled by the date the student withdraws from the institution or unit, instead of issuing the student a refund in the amount required under Subsection (b), the institution or unit may credit the amount to be refunded toward the payment of the outstanding tuition and mandatory fees owed by the student.  The institution or unit shall issue a refund to the student if any portion of the amount to be refunded remains after the outstanding tuition and mandatory fees have been paid.
    
    (b-2)  A general academic teaching institution or medical and dental unit may provide to a student withdrawing from the institution or unit a refund of a portion of the tuition and mandatory fees charged to the student by the institution or unit for the courses in which the student is enrolled on the date the student withdraws in an amount greater than the amount required by Subsection (b).  The institution or unit may apply the portion of the refund authorized by this subsection toward the payment of any outstanding tuition and fees as provided by Subsection (b-1), and may refund the remainder of that portion in the form of, as the institution or unit considers appropriate:
    
    (1)  a payment made directly to the student; or
    
    (2)  credit toward payment of tuition and mandatory fees for a subsequent semester or other academic term at the institution or unit.
    
    (c)  Separate withdrawal refund schedules may be established for optional fees.
    
    (d)  A general academic teaching institution or medical and dental unit shall refund tuition and fees paid by a sponsor, donor, or scholarship to the source rather than directly to the student who has withdrawn if the funds were made available through the institution.
    
    (e)  A general academic teaching institution or medical and dental unit may terminate a student's student services and privileges, including health services, library privileges, facilities and technology usage, and athletic and cultural entertainment tickets, when the student withdraws from the institution.
    
    (f)  Beginning with the summer semester of 1990, if a student withdraws from an institution of higher education because the student is called to active military service, the institution, at the student's option, shall:
    
    (1)  refund the tuition and fees paid by the student for the semester in which the student withdraws;
    
    (2)  grant a student, who is eligible under the institution's guidelines, an incomplete grade in all courses by designating "withdrawn-military" on the student's transcript;  or
    
    (3)  as determined by the instructor, assign an appropriate final grade or credit to a student who has satisfactorily completed a substantial amount of coursework and who has demonstrated sufficient mastery of the course material.

    Sec. 54.0065.  TUITION REBATE FOR CERTAIN UNDERGRADUATES.  (a)  A qualified student is eligible for a rebate of a portion of the undergraduate tuition the student has paid if the student:
    
    (1)  is awarded a baccalaureate degree from a general academic teaching institution within:
    
    (A)  four calendar years after the date the student initially enrolled in the institution or another postsecondary educational institution if:
    
    (i)  the institution awarding the degree is a four-year institution; and
    
    (ii)  the student is awarded a degree other than a degree in engineering, architecture, or any other program determined by the coordinating board to require more than four years to complete; or
    
    (B)  five calendar years after the date the student initially enrolled in the institution or another postsecondary educational institution if:
    
    (i)  the institution awarding the degree is a four-year institution; and
    
    (ii)  the student is awarded a degree in engineering, architecture, or any other program determined by the coordinating board to require more than four years to complete; and
    
    (2)  has attempted no more than three hours in excess of the minimum number of semester credit hours required to complete the degree program:
    
    (A)  including:
    
    (i)  transfer credits; and
    
    (ii)  course credit earned exclusively by examination, except that, for purposes of this subsection, only the number of semester credit hours earned exclusively by examination in excess of nine semester credit hours is treated as hours attempted; and
    
    (B)  excluding:
    
    (i)  course credit that is earned to satisfy requirements for a Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program but that is not required to complete the degree program; and
    
    (ii)  course credit, other than course credit earned exclusively by examination, that is earned before graduating from high school.
    
    (b)  The amount of tuition to be rebated to a student under this section is $1,000, unless the total amount of undergraduate tuition paid by the student to the institution of higher education awarding the degree was less than $1,000, in which event the amount of tuition to be rebated is an amount equal to the amount of undergraduate tuition paid by the student to the institution.  However, a student who paid the institution awarding the degree an amount of undergraduate tuition less than $1,000 may qualify for an increase in the amount of the rebate, not to exceed a total rebate of $1,000, for any amount of undergraduate tuition the student paid to other institutions of higher education by providing the institution with proof of the total amount of that tuition paid to other institutions of higher education.
    
    (c)  A student who has transferred from another institution of higher education shall provide the institution awarding the degree an official transcript from each institution attended by the student in order that the period during which the student has been enrolled in a general academic teaching institution and the total number of hours attempted by the student can be verified.
    
    (d)  To qualify for a rebate under this section, the student must have been a resident of this state and entitled to pay tuition at the rate provided by this chapter for a resident student at all times while pursuing the degree.
    
    (e)  All institutions of higher education shall notify each first-time freshman student of the tuition rebate program.
    
    (f)  The institution awarding the degree shall pay the rebate under this section from local funds.
    
    (g)  If a student entitled to a rebate under this section has an outstanding student loan, including an emergency loan, owed or guaranteed by this state, including the Texas Guaranteed Student Loan Corporation, the institution shall apply the amount of the rebate to the student's loan.  If a student has more than one outstanding loan, the institution shall apply the amount of the rebate to the loans as directed by the student or, if the student fails to provide timely instructions on the application of the amount, the institution shall apply the amount of the rebate to the loans according to priorities established by the coordinating board.  If the amount of the rebate exceeds the amount of the loan indebtedness, the institution shall pay the student the excess amount.
    
    (h)  The legislature shall account in the General Appropriations Act for the rebates authorized by this section in a way that provides a corresponding increase in the general revenue funds appropriated to the institution.  It is the intent of the legislature that rebates authorized by this section shall be financed by savings to the state resulting from reductions in the number of courses taken by undergraduate students.
    
    (i)  The coordinating board, in consultation with the institutions of higher education, shall adopt rules for the administration of this section, including a rule to allow an otherwise eligible student to receive a rebate under this section if the student is not awarded a baccalaureate degree within the period required by Subsection (a)(1) solely as a result of a hardship or other good cause.  The performance of active duty military service by a student shall be recognized as "good cause" for purposes of this section.

    (1)  full payment of tuition and mandatory fees not later than the date established by the institution for purposes of this subdivision; or

    (a-1)  In providing for the payment of tuition and mandatory fees by installment under Subsection (a)(2), an institution of higher education must also establish subsequent dates at periodic intervals within the applicable semester or term by which subsequent installment payments are due.
    
    (b)  For a term of less than 10 weeks, the governing board of each institution of higher education:
    
    (1)  shall provide for the payment of tuition and mandatory fees by requiring full payment of tuition and mandatory fees not later than the date established by the institution for purposes of this subdivision; and
    
    (2)  may provide for the payment of tuition and mandatory fees by requiring payment in installments under one or more payment plan options that require the first payment to be made not later than the date established by the institution for purposes of this subdivision.

    (b-2)  An institution of higher education may collect on a due date subsequent to a due date established under Subsection (a) or (b):
    
    (1)  unpaid tuition and mandatory fee balances resulting from an adjustment to a student's enrollment status or an administrative action; or
    
    (2)  unpaid residual balances of tuition and mandatory fees constituting less than five percent of the total amount of tuition and mandatory fees charged to the student by the institution for that semester or term.
    
    (c)  The governing board of an institution of higher education may assess and collect incidental fees for students utilizing the payment alternative authorized by Subsection (a)(2) or (b)(2) and for students delinquent in payments.  The fees must reasonably reflect the cost to the institution of handling those payments.
    
    (d)  A student who fails to make a full payment of the required amount of tuition and mandatory fees, including any incidental fees, by the applicable due date under this section may be prohibited from registering for classes until full payment is made.  A student who fails to make full payment prior to the end of the semester or term may be denied credit for the work done that semester or term.  The governing board of an institution of higher education may not impose on a student any sanction authorized by this subsection unless the governing board includes in any written or electronic agreement authorized by the student the following statement printed in bold-faced type or in capital letters:  "A STUDENT WHO FAILS TO MAKE FULL PAYMENT OF TUITION AND MANDATORY FEES, INCLUDING ANY INCIDENTAL FEES, BY THE DUE DATE MAY BE PROHIBITED FROM REGISTERING FOR CLASSES UNTIL FULL PAYMENT IS MADE.  A STUDENT WHO FAILS TO MAKE FULL PAYMENT PRIOR TO THE END OF THE SEMESTER OR TERM MAY BE DENIED CREDIT FOR THE WORK DONE THAT SEMESTER OR TERM."  The governing board shall notify a student of any delinquent tuition or fee payment as soon as practicable.  The institution's records may be adjusted to reflect the student's failure to have properly enrolled for that semester or term.
    
    (e)  In addition to other payment alternatives provided by this section, the governing board of a medical and dental unit or of a general academic teaching institution with a department or college of veterinary medicine may provide for the payment of tuition and mandatory fees at the unit or at the department or college of veterinary medicine during any academic year through a one-fourth payment of tuition and mandatory fees in advance of the beginning of the year and subsequent one-fourth payments of tuition and mandatory fees to be made at periods designated by the governing board.

    (f)  A student may elect to pay the tuition and mandatory fees of an institution of higher education by installment under this section regardless of whether the student intends to apply a financial aid award administered by the institution toward the tuition and mandatory fees, except that a student whose financial aid award or awards are available to cover the total amount of tuition and mandatory fees may not pay by installment under this section.  On receipt of notice of a student's election to pay tuition and mandatory fees by installment, the governing board of the institution shall apply any financial aid award administered for the student toward the amount of tuition and mandatory fees due for that semester or term until the tuition and mandatory fees are paid in full and shall immediately release any remaining amount of the award to the student, except that the institution is not required to apply the award or awards toward the total amount of tuition and mandatory fees in exigent circumstances as determined by the institution.
    
    (g)  The governing board of an institution of higher education shall require a student who elects to pay tuition and  mandatory fees by installment under this section to enter into a written or electronic agreement reflecting the terms and conditions required by this section for the installment plan provided for the student by the governing board.

    (1)  as a graduate or undergraduate student, maintains a grade point average that satisfies the institution's grade point average requirement for making satisfactory academic progress toward a degree or certificate in accordance with the institution's policy regarding eligibility for financial aid; and
    
    (2)  as an undergraduate student, has not completed as of the beginning of the semester or term a number of semester credit hours that is considered to be excessive under Section [54.014](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=54.014), unless permitted to complete those hours by the institution on a showing of good cause.

    (c)  If on the completion of any semester or term a person fails to meet any requirement of Subsection (a), for the next semester or term in which the person enrolls the person may not receive the exemption or waiver described by Subsection (a).  A person may become eligible to receive an exemption or waiver in a subsequent semester or term if the person:
    
    (1)  completes a semester or term during which the person is not eligible for an exemption or waiver; and
    
    (2)  meets each requirement of Subsection (a), as applicable.

For purposes of this subsection, a person is not required to enroll in a summer term to remain continuously enrolled in a degree or certificate program.

    (2)  following the death of a person who becomes eligible for an exemption provided by Subsection (a), the assignment of the exemption for the unused portion of the credit hours to a child of the person, to be made by the person's spouse or by the conservator, guardian, custodian, or other legally designated caretaker of the child, if the child does not otherwise qualify for an exemption under Subsection (b).
    
    (k-1)  The procedures under Subsection (k) must provide:
    
    (1)  the manner in which a person may waive the exemption;
    
    (2)  the manner in which a child may be designated to receive the exemption;

    (4)  a method of documentation to enable institutions of higher education to determine the eligibility of the designated child to receive the exemption; and
    
    (5)  a procedure permitting a person who waived the exemption and designated a child to receive the exemption to revoke that designation as to any unused portion of the assigned credit hours.
    
    (l)  To be eligible to receive an exemption under Subsection (k), the child must:
    
    (1)  be a student who is classified as a resident under Subchapter B when the child enrolls in an institution of higher education;
    
    (2)  as a graduate or undergraduate student, maintain a grade point average that satisfies the grade point average requirement for making satisfactory academic progress in a degree, certificate, or continuing education program as determined by the institution at which the child is enrolled in accordance with the institution's policy regarding eligibility for financial aid; and
    
    (3)  be 25 years of age or younger on the first day of the semester or other academic term for which the exemption is claimed.

    (n)  The Texas Veterans Commission by rule shall prescribe procedures by which a child assigned an exemption under Subsection (k) who suffered from a severe illness or other debilitating condition that affected the child's ability to use the exemption before reaching the age described by Subsection (l)(3) may be granted additional time to use the exemption corresponding to the time the child was unable to use the exemption because of the illness or condition.
    
    (o)  The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board and the Texas Veterans Commission shall coordinate to provide each respective agency with any information required to ensure the proper administration of this section and the proper execution of each agency's statutory responsibilities concerning this section.

    (2)  gifts and grants contributed to the fund; and
    
    (3)  the returns received from investment of money in the fund.
    
    (c)  The trust company shall administer the fund.  The trust company shall determine the amount available for distribution from the fund, determined in accordance with a distribution policy that is adopted by the comptroller and designed to preserve the purchasing power of the fund's assets and to provide a stable and predictable stream of annual distributions.  Expenses of managing the fund's assets shall be paid from the fund.  Except as provided by this section, money in the fund may not be used for any purpose.

    (f)  The governing board of an institution of higher education entitled to receive money under this section may solicit and accept gifts and grants to the fund.  A gift or grant to the fund must be distributed and appropriated for the purposes of the fund, subject to any limitation or requirement placed on the gift or grant by the donor or granting entity.

The fee or fees may be either voluntary or compulsory as determined by the governing board.  The total of all compulsory student services fees collected from a student at an institution of higher education other than The University of Texas at Austin or a component institution of the University of Houston System for any one semester or summer session shall not exceed $250. All compulsory student services fees charged and collected under this section by the governing board of an institution of higher education, other than a public junior college, shall be assessed in proportion to the number of semester credit hours for which a student registers.  No portion of the compulsory fees collected may be expended for parking facilities or services, except as related to providing shuttle bus services.
    
    (c)  The provisions of this section do not affect the building use fees or other special fees authorized by the legislature for any institution for the purpose of financing revenue bond issues.
    
    (d)  All money collected as student services fees shall be reserved and accounted for in an account or accounts kept separate and apart from educational and general funds of the institution and shall be used only for the support of student services.  All the money shall be placed in a depository bank or banks designated by the governing board and shall be secured as required by law.  Each year the governing board shall approve for the institution a separate budget for student activities and services financed by fees authorized in this section.  The budget shall show the fees to be assessed, the purpose or functions to be financed, the estimated income to be derived, and the proposed expenditures to be made. Copies of the budgets shall be filed annually with the coordinating board, the governor, the legislative budget board, and the state library.
    
    (e)  Repealed by Acts 2011, 82nd Leg., R.S., Ch. 359, Sec. 16(2), eff. January 1, 2012.
    
    (f)  If the total compulsory fee charged under this section is more than $150, the increase does not take effect unless the increase is approved by a majority vote of the students voting in an election held for that purpose or by a majority vote of the student government at the institution.  In subsequent years, an election authorizing a fee increase must be held before the fee can be increased by more than 10 percent of the fee approved at the last student election.
    
    (g)  If a student registers at more than one institution of higher education within a college or university system under concurrent enrollment provisions of joint or cooperative programs between institutions, the student shall pay all compulsory student services fees to the institution designated as the home institution under the joint or cooperative program.  The governing board of the college or university system may waive the payment of all compulsory student services fees at the other institution or institutions.
    
    (h)  Except for Subsection (g) of this section, this section does not apply to The University of Texas at Austin or a component institution of the University of Houston System.
    
    (i)  General revenue appropriations, other educational and general income, and funds appropriated under Article VII, Section [17](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=7.17) or [18](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=7.18), of the Texas Constitution may be expended on a proportional use basis to support the services, activities, and facilities provided for in this section to the extent that the use of such funds is not otherwise restricted by the Texas Constitution or general law.

The governing board of the system is not required to set uniform fees or rates for component institutions.
    
    (c)  The board may make fees for a particular student service voluntary or compulsory.
    
    (d)  Any compulsory fees for student services charged under this section shall be assessed in proportion to the number of semester credit hours for which a student registers unless the rate of such fee is specifically established by law or authority and approval of the board to be a minimum amount to be charged to each student for any semester or summer term.

The student members shall be selected and designated as appropriate so that three members of the committee are serving terms of two years, and two members are serving terms of one year.  If a student government does not exist, the students shall be elected by the students enrolled in the university.  At each election, the appropriate number of students shall be elected for terms of appropriate length so that three are serving terms of two years, and two are serving terms of one year.  Candidates shall file for either a one-year or a two-year position.

    (f)  The president shall duly consider the recommendations of the student fees advisory committee during the annual budgetary process.  If the president's recommendations to the board of regents are substantially different from those of the student fees advisory committee, the administration shall so notify the student fees advisory committee.  Such notification shall be in sufficient time for the committee to request an appearance at the board of regents meeting during which the president's recommendations will be considered.  The administration shall provide to a student member designated by the student members of the committee, on that student member's request, the most recent and complete recommendations of the president to the board.

    (b)  In addition to the fee authorized under Subsection (a) of this section, the Board of Regents of The Texas A&M University System may levy and collect from each student registered at Prairie View A&M University a supplemental group hospital and medical services fee not to exceed $30 for each regular semester and not to exceed $12.50 for each term of the summer session.  The supplemental group hospital and medical services fee may not be levied unless the levy of the fee has been approved by a majority vote of the students registered at Prairie View A&M University participating in a general election called for that purpose.
    
    (c)  A fee levied under this section at a component institution of The Texas A&M University System may be used only to provide hospital or other medical services to students registered at that component institution.
    
    (d)  If, in an academic year, the total compulsory fee charged under this section is more than 10 percent higher than the compulsory fee charged under this section for the previous academic year, the increase does not take effect unless the increase is approved by a majority vote of the students voting in an election held for that purpose.
    
    (e)  If, in an academic year, the total compulsory fee charged under this section is proposed to be increased by an amount less than 10 percent over that charged in the previous academic year, the Board of Regents of The Texas A&M University System may, in lieu of an election, hold a public meeting on the increase prior to its taking effect in which students have the opportunity to comment.

Because the state's population is rapidly growing and is diverse, the state is required to use all of the higher education facilities and resources within the state, both public and private, to provide a wide variety of educational environments and instructional options and to preserve the partnership between the state and private or independent institutions of higher education and between the state and career schools and colleges, as defined by Section [132.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=132.001), that offer a two-year associate degree as approved by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.

    (h)  Notwithstanding other provisions of this subchapter, any contract benefits purchased under this subchapter may be applied to the payment of tuition and required fees at a career school or college as if the school or college were an institution of higher education or private or independent institution of higher education.

    Sec. 54.753.  PREPAID TUITION UNITS: PURCHASE; ASSIGNED VALUE; TYPES; PRICE.  (a)  Under the program, a purchaser may prepay the costs of all or a portion of a beneficiary's undergraduate tuition and required fees at a general academic teaching institution, two-year institution of higher education, private or independent institution of higher education, medical and dental unit, career school, accredited out-of-state institution of higher education, or registered apprenticeship program by entering into a prepaid tuition contract with the board to purchase one or more tuition units of a type described by this section at the applicable price established by the board for that type of unit for the year in which the unit is purchased.  The portion of the beneficiary's undergraduate tuition and required fees for which a tuition unit may be redeemed at a particular general academic teaching institution or two-year institution of higher education is assigned to the tuition unit at the time of purchase, and the tuition unit may be redeemed to pay that portion of the tuition and fees at the general academic teaching institution or two-year institution of higher education in any academic year in which the unit is redeemed in accordance with this subchapter.  The purchaser may purchase one type of unit or a combination of two or three types of units.
    
    (b)  The assigned value of a tuition unit, purchased as provided by this section, when used to pay the cost of tuition and required fees at a general academic teaching institution or two-year institution of higher education, is equal to one percent of the amount necessary for the academic year in which the unit is redeemed to cover the applicable cost of undergraduate resident tuition and required fees for one academic year consisting of 30 semester credit hours as follows:
    
    (1)  for a Type I tuition unit, the cost of undergraduate resident tuition and required fees charged by the general academic teaching institution with the highest such tuition and fee costs, determined as provided by Subsection (d);
    
    (2)  for a Type II tuition unit, the weighted average undergraduate resident tuition and required fees charged by general academic teaching institutions, determined as provided by Subsection (e); and
    
    (3)  for a Type III tuition unit, the weighted average undergraduate resident tuition and required fees of two-year institutions of higher education, determined as provided by Subsection (f).
    
    (c)  Each year, the board shall establish the price at which each type of tuition unit may be purchased during the next sales period and the percentage of the total cost of undergraduate resident tuition and required fees for one academic year consisting of 30 semester credit hours for which each type of tuition unit may be redeemed at each general academic teaching institution and two-year institution.  The percentage shall be based on the total cost of required tuition and fees at a particular general academic teaching institution or two-year institution of higher education in relation to the amount determined for the institution with the highest cost or weighted average cost, as applicable.  The purchase price established for each type of unit must be equal to the applicable cost of tuition and required fees as determined under this section for the most recent academic year that began before the beginning of the sales period.  The sales period to which those prices apply expires on the first anniversary of the date the units become available for purchase at the prices established for that year.
    
    (c-1)  On or before June 1, each general academic teaching institution and each two-year institution of higher education shall annually provide information for the next fall semester to the board in a format requested by the board, to assist the board in determining tuition unit sales prices for the next sales period and redemption values for the next academic year.
    
    (d)  The board shall base the purchase price of a Type I tuition unit on one percent of the cost of the undergraduate resident tuition and required fees for the applicable academic year at the general academic teaching institution with the highest such tuition and fee cost for that academic year.
    
    (e)  The board shall base the purchase price of a Type II tuition unit on one percent of the cost of the weighted average general academic teaching institution undergraduate resident tuition and required fees for the applicable academic year.  That cost is determined by:
    
    (1)  for each general academic teaching institution, multiplying the average amount of the institution's undergraduate resident tuition and required fees for an academic year consisting of 30 semester credit hours by the number of full-time equivalent undergraduate resident students at that institution;
    
    (2)  adding together the products computed under Subdivision (1) for each institution; and
    
    (3)  dividing the sum determined under Subdivision (2) by the total number of full-time equivalent undergraduate resident students at all general academic teaching institutions.
    
    (f)  The board shall base the purchase price of a Type III tuition unit on one percent of the cost of the weighted average two-year institution of higher education undergraduate resident tuition and required fees for the applicable academic year, disregarding any portion of the tuition charged by a public junior college to a resident of this state who does not reside within the taxing jurisdiction of the junior college.  That cost is determined by:
    
    (1)  for each two-year institution of higher education, multiplying the average amount of the institution's undergraduate resident tuition and required fees for an academic year consisting of 30 semester credit hours by the number of full-time equivalent undergraduate resident students at that institution;
    
    (2)  adding together the products computed under Subdivision (1) for each institution; and
    
    (3)  dividing the sum determined under Subdivision (2) by the total number of full-time equivalent undergraduate resident students at all two-year institutions of higher education.
    
    (g)  The total amount paid under a prepaid tuition contract on behalf of a single beneficiary may not exceed any limit established on the amount by Section 529, Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  The board shall establish, in compliance with Section 529, Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the minimum amount that the purchaser is required to pay under the contract on behalf of a single beneficiary.
    
    (h)  At the time of the establishment of the account to which a purchaser's prepaid tuition contract money is assigned, the board may impose an administrative fee not to exceed $25.  Money from that fee must be used directly in maintaining the actuarial soundness of the fund as required by Section [54.770](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=54.770).  The board may not impose any other fee or charge in connection with the sale of a tuition unit.

    Sec. 54.754.  REDEMPTION OF TUITION UNITS.  (a)  In accordance with this subchapter, when a beneficiary under a prepaid tuition contract redeems one or more tuition units to pay costs of tuition and required fees, the board shall apply money in the fund, in the amount provided by Section [54.765](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=54.765) to pay all or the applicable portion of the costs of the beneficiary's tuition and required fees at the general academic teaching institution, two-year institution of higher education, private or independent institution of higher education, medical and dental unit, career school, accredited out-of-state institution of higher education, or registered apprenticeship program in which the beneficiary enrolls.  Subject to Subsection (b)(2) and the other provisions of this section, a beneficiary may redeem any type of tuition unit for attendance at an institution, unit, school, or program described by this section.  A general academic teaching institution or two-year institution of higher education shall accept the amount transferred to the institution under Section [54.765](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=54.765)(c) when the unit or units are redeemed as payment for all or the applicable portion of the beneficiary's tuition and required fees.
    
    (b)  To pay for the entire cost of undergraduate resident tuition and required fees for an academic year consisting of 30 semester credit hours, redemption of 100 Type I tuition units is required at the general academic teaching institution with the highest tuition and fee cost as described by Section [54.753](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=54.753)(d), redemption of 100 Type II tuition units is required at a general academic teaching institution with the applicable tuition and fee cost at the weighted average as described by Subsection (e) of that section, and redemption of 100 Type III units is required at a two-year institution of higher education with the applicable tuition and fee cost at the weighted average as described by Subsection (f) of that section.  The number of tuition units that must be redeemed to pay for the entire cost of tuition and required fees for an academic year at another general academic teaching institution or two-year institution of higher education may be higher or lower:
    
    (1)  in proportion to the amount that the cost of tuition and required fees at that institution is higher or lower than the amount determined for the institution with the highest cost or weighted average cost, as applicable; or
    
    (2)  if a more or less valuable type of tuition unit is redeemed.
    
    (c)  To assist purchasers in determining the number of tuition units a beneficiary must redeem to cover the costs of tuition and required fees at general academic teaching institutions and two-year institutions of higher education, each year the board shall prepare a tuition unit redemption chart and shall post the chart on an Internet website.  The chart must show for each general academic teaching institution and for each two-year institution of higher education the number of each type of units purchased that year that would be required to cover the cost of tuition and required fees, based on an academic year consisting of 30 semester credit hours.
    
    (d)  If a beneficiary redeems fewer tuition units of the type or combination of types necessary to pay the total cost of the beneficiary's tuition and required fees at the general academic teaching institution, two-year institution of higher education, private or independent institution of higher education, medical and dental unit, career school, accredited out-of-state institution of higher education, or registered apprenticeship program at which the beneficiary enrolls, the beneficiary is responsible for paying the amount of the difference between the amount of tuition and required fees for which the beneficiary pays through the redemption of one or more tuition units and the total cost of the beneficiary's tuition and required fees at the institution, unit, school, or program.
    
    (d-1)  A beneficiary who redeems one or more Type III tuition units to attend a public junior college and who does not reside within the taxing jurisdiction of the junior college is responsible for paying any portion of the tuition charged by the junior college to persons who do not reside within that taxing jurisdiction.
    
    (e)  If the beneficiary redeems fewer tuition units to pay the cost of tuition and required fees than the number of units purchased on behalf of the beneficiary under a prepaid tuition contract, other than to defer redemption as permitted in accordance with Section [54.758](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=54.758), the purchaser may:
    
    (1)  redeem for cash the amount of the purchase price of the excess units, plus annual interest earned on that money, accrued at a rate set by the board not to exceed five percent annually; or
    
    (2)  transfer the remaining units to another beneficiary in accordance with this subchapter.
    
    (f)  A beneficiary or purchaser may not redeem a tuition unit earlier than the third anniversary of the date the unit was purchased.
