    Sec. 56.002.  DECLARATION OF POLICY.  The legislature, giving due consideration to the historical and continuing interest of the people of the State of Texas in encouraging deserving and qualified persons to realize their aspirations for education beyond high school finds and declares that postsecondary education for those who desire such an education and are properly qualified therefor is important to the welfare and security of this state and the nation and, consequently, is an important public purpose.  The legislature finds and declares that the state can achieve its full economic and social potential only if every individual has the opportunity to contribute to the full extent of his capabilities and only when financial barriers to his economic, social, and educational goals are removed.  It is, therefore, the policy of the legislature and the purpose of this Chapter to establish financial assistance programs to enable qualified students to receive a postsecondary education.

    Sec. 56.0092.  TEXAS B-ON-TIME STUDENT LOAN ACCOUNT; FORMER LOAN PROGRAM CONTINUED IN EFFECT FOR CERTAIN ACADEMIC YEARS ONLY.  (a)  The Texas B-On-time student loan account previously established by former Section 56.463 continues as an account in the general revenue fund.  The account consists of:
    
    (1)  gifts and grants;
    
    (2)  any legislative appropriations received for the purpose of awarding Texas B-On-time student loans to students who qualify and establish eligibility for the loans as described by Subsection (c) and for discharging any other remaining obligations under the former Texas B-On-time student loan program;

    (c)  Beginning with the 2015 fall semester, the coordinating board may not award an initial Texas B-On-time student loan under the Texas B-On-time student loan program.  The coordinating board may award, for a semester or term occurring before the 2020 fall semester, a subsequent Texas B-On-time student loan to an eligible student who received an initial Texas B-On-time student loan before the 2015-2016 academic year.  For Texas B-On-time student loans to be awarded as described by this subsection:
    
    (1)  students may qualify and establish continued eligibility, as applicable, under Subchapter Q as that subchapter existed immediately before September 1, 2015; and

    (e)  An appropriation under Subsection (d) must be made in accordance with a formula, adopted by coordinating board rule, that the coordinating board determines fairly allocates the appropriated amount to those eligible institutions at which the Texas B-On-time student loan program was underutilized.  For purposes of this subsection, the Texas B-On-time student loan program is considered to have been underutilized by students of an institution in any period if the institution's percentage of the total amount of tuition set aside by all institutions under the program during the period was greater than the institution's percentage of all students who received a Texas B-On-time student loan under the program for the same period.  The coordinating board shall base the coordinating board's determination on a period of academic years occurring before the 2015-2016 academic year that the coordinating board considers representative of eligible institutions' student participation in the Texas B-On-time student loan program.
    
    (e-1)  An eligible institution that receives an appropriation of money under Subsection (d) may use the money only to support efforts to increase the number of at-risk students who graduate from the institution or the rate at which at-risk students graduate from the institution.
    
    (f)  In this section:
    
    (1)  "At-risk student" means an undergraduate student of an eligible institution:
    
    (A)  who has previously received a grant under the federal Pell Grant program or met the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) criterion for a grant under that program; or
    
    (B)  whose total score on the SAT or the ACT, excluding the optional essay test, is less than the national mean of students' scores on the applicable test.
    
    (2)  "Eligible institution" means a general academic teaching institution described by Section 56.451(2)(A) or a medical and dental unit described by Section 56.451(2)(B), as those paragraphs existed immediately before September 1, 2015.

    Sec. 56.303.  ADMINISTRATION OF PROGRAM.  (a)  The coordinating board shall administer the TEXAS grant program and shall adopt any rules necessary to implement the TEXAS grant program or this subchapter.  The coordinating board shall consult with the student financial aid officers of eligible institutions in developing the rules.
    
    (b)  The coordinating board shall adopt rules to provide a TEXAS grant to an eligible student enrolled in an eligible institution in the most efficient manner possible.
    
    (c)  The total amount of TEXAS grants awarded may not exceed the amount available for the program from appropriations, gifts, grants, or other funds.
    
    (d)  From money appropriated by the legislature for the purposes of this subchapter, the coordinating board annually shall determine the allocation of money available for TEXAS grants among general academic teaching institutions and other eligible institutions and shall distribute the money accordingly.
    
    (d-1)  In allocating among eligible institutions money available for initial TEXAS grants for an academic year, the coordinating board shall ensure that each of those institutions' proportional share of the total amount of money for initial grants that is allocated to eligible institutions under this section for that year does not, as a result of the number of students who establish eligibility at the institution for an initial grant under Section [56.3041](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=56.3041)(2)(A), change from the institution's proportional share of the total amount of money for initial grants that is allocated to those institutions under this section for the preceding academic year.
    
    (e)  In determining who should receive a TEXAS grant, the coordinating board and the eligible institutions shall give priority to awarding TEXAS grants to students who demonstrate the greatest financial need and whose expected family contribution, as determined according to the methodology used for federal student financial aid, does not exceed 60 percent of the average statewide amount of tuition and required fees described by Section [56.307](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=56.307)(a).  In giving priority based on financial need as required by this subsection to students who meet the requirements for the highest priority as provided by Subsection (f), an eligible institution shall determine financial need according to the relative expected family contribution of those students, beginning with students who have the lowest expected family contribution.
    
    (f)  Beginning with TEXAS grants awarded for the 2013-2014 academic year, in determining who should receive an initial TEXAS grant, each eligible institution, in addition to giving priority as provided by Subsection (e), shall give highest priority to students who meet the eligibility criteria described by Section [56.3041](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=56.3041)(2)(A).  If there is money available in excess of the amount required to award an initial TEXAS grant to all students meeting those criteria, an eligible institution shall make awards to other students who meet the eligibility criteria described by Section [56.304](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=56.304)(a)(2)(A), provided that the institution continues to give priority to students as provided by Subsection (e).
