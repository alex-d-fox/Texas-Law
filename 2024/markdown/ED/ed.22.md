    Sec. 22.001.  SALARY DEDUCTIONS FOR PROFESSIONAL DUES.  (a)  A school district employee is entitled to have an amount deducted from the employee's salary for membership fees or dues to a professional organization.  The employee must:
    
    (1)  file with the district a signed written request identifying the organization and specifying the number of pay periods per year the deductions are to be made;  and
    
    (2)  inform the district of the total amount of the fees and dues for each year or have the organization notify the district of the amount.
    
    (b)  The district shall deduct the total amount of the fees or dues for a year in equal amounts per pay period for the number of periods specified by the employee.  The deductions shall be made until the employee requests in writing that the deductions be discontinued.
    
    (c)  The school district may charge an administrative fee for making the deduction.  A fee imposed for making a salary deduction under this section may not exceed either the actual administrative cost of making the deduction or the lowest fee the district charges for similar salary deductions, whichever is less.

    Sec. 22.002.  ASSIGNMENT, TRANSFER, OR PLEDGE OF COMPENSATION.  (a)  In this section, "school employee" means any person employed by a school district in an executive, administrative, or clerical capacity or as a superintendent, principal, teacher, or instructor.
    
    (b)  Any school employee's assignment, pledge, or transfer, as security for indebtedness, of any interest in or part of the employee's salary or wages then due or that may become due under an existing contract of employment is enforceable only:
    
    (1)  if, before or at the time of execution, delivery, or acceptance of an assignment, pledge, or transfer, written approval is obtained in accordance with the policy of the employing school district;  and
    
    (2)  to the extent that the indebtedness it secures is a valid and enforceable obligation.
    
    (c)  A school district shall honor an assignment, pledge, or transfer fulfilling the conditions of Subsection (b) without incurring any liability to the school employee executing the assignment, pledge, or transfer.  Payment to any assignee, pledgee, or transferee in accordance with the terms of the instrument constitutes payment to or for the account of the assignor, pledgor, or transferor.  An assignment, pledge, or transfer is enforceable only to the extent of salary due or that may become due during continuation of the assignor's employment as a school employee.
    
    (d)  Venue for any suit against the employer of a school employee to enforce an assignment, pledge, or transfer of salary is in the county where the employing school is located.

    Sec. 22.003.  MINIMUM PERSONAL LEAVE PROGRAM.  (a)  A state minimum personal leave program consisting of five days per year personal leave with no limit on accumulation and transferable among districts shall be provided for school district employees.  School districts may provide additional personal leave beyond this minimum.  The board of trustees of a school district may adopt a policy governing an employee's use of personal leave granted under this subsection, except that the policy may not restrict:
    
    (1)  the purposes for which the leave may be used; or
    
    (2)  the order in which an employee may use the state minimum personal leave and any additional personal leave provided by the school district.
    
    (b)  In addition to all other days of leave provided by this section or by the school district, an employee of a school district who is physically assaulted during the performance of the employee's regular duties is entitled to the number of days of leave necessary to recuperate from all physical injuries sustained as a result of the assault.  At the request of an employee, the school district must immediately assign an employee to assault leave and, on investigation of the claim, may change the assault leave status and charge the leave against the employee's accrued personal leave or against an employee's pay if insufficient accrued personal leave is available.  Days of leave taken under this subsection may not be deducted from accrued personal leave.  The period provided by this subsection may not extend more than two years beyond the date of the assault.  Notwithstanding any other law, assault leave policy benefits due to an employee shall be coordinated with temporary income benefits due from workers' compensation so that the employee's total compensation from temporary income benefits and assault leave policy benefits equals 100 percent of the employee's weekly rate of pay.
    
    (c)  For purposes of Subsection (b), an employee of a school district is physically assaulted if the person engaging in the conduct causing injury to the employee:
    
    (1)  could be prosecuted for assault;  or
    
    (2)  could not be prosecuted for assault only because the person's age or mental capacity makes the person a nonresponsible person for purposes of criminal liability.
    
    (c-1)  Any informational handbook a school district provides to employees in an electronic or paper form or makes  available by posting on the district website must include notification of an employee's rights under Subsection (b) in the relevant section of the handbook.  Any form used by a school district through which an employee may request leave under this section must include assault leave under Subsection (b) as an option.
    
    (d)  A school district employee with available personal leave under this section is entitled to use the leave for compensation during a term of active military service.  This subsection applies to any personal or sick leave available under former law or provided by local policy of a school district, including a home-rule school district.
    
    (e)  A school district, including a home-rule school district, may adopt a policy providing for the paid leave of absence of employees taking leave for active military service as part of the consideration of employment by the district.
    
    (f)  A public school employee who retains any sick leave accumulated under former Section 13.904(a), as that section existed on January 1, 1995, is entitled to use the sick leave provided under that section or the personal leave provided under Subsection (a) in any order to the extent that the leave the employee uses is appropriate to the purpose of the leave.

    Sec. 22.0832.  NATIONAL CRIMINAL HISTORY RECORD INFORMATION REVIEW OF CERTAIN OPEN-ENROLLMENT CHARTER SCHOOL EMPLOYEES.  (a)  The agency shall review the national criminal history record information of an employee of an open-enrollment charter school to whom Section [12.1059](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=12.1059) applies in the same manner as the State Board for Educator Certification reviews certified educators under Section [22.0831](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=22.0831).  If the agency determines that, based on information contained in an employee's criminal history record information, the employee would not be eligible for educator certification under Subchapter [B](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=21.031), Chapter [21](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=21), the agency shall notify the open-enrollment charter school in writing that the person may not be employed by the school or serve in a capacity described by Section [12.1059](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=12.1059).
    
    (b)  An open-enrollment charter school must provide the agency with any information requested by the agency to enable the agency to complete a review under Subsection (a).  Failure of an open-enrollment charter school to provide information under this subsection is a material violation of the school's charter.
