    Sec. 48.001.  STATE POLICY.

    (m)  The commissioner shall adopt rules necessary to implement this section, including rules that:
    
    (1)  establish the minimum amount of instructional time per day that allows a school district or charter school to be eligible for full average daily attendance, which may differ based on the instructional program offered by the district or charter school;
    
    (2)  establish the requirements necessary for a school district or charter school to be eligible for one-half of average daily attendance, which may differ based on the instructional program offered by the district or charter school;
    
    (3)  proportionally reduce the average daily attendance for a school district if any campus or instructional program in the district provides fewer than the required minimum minutes of instruction to students; and
    
    (4)  allow a grade or course repeated under Section [28.02124](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=28.02124) to qualify for average daily attendance even if the student previously passed or earned credit for the grade or course, if the grade or course would otherwise be eligible.
    
    (n)  To assist school districts in implementing this section as amended by H.B. 2442, Acts of the 85th Legislature, Regular Session, 2017, the commissioner may waive a requirement of this section or adopt rules to implement this section.

The funding weight for this arrangement shall be 4.0 for those students who receive their education service on a local school district campus.  A special instructional arrangement for students with disabilities residing in state schools shall be established by commissioner rule with a funding weight of 2.8.
    
    (c)  For funding purposes, the number of contact hours credited per day for each student in the off home campus instructional arrangement may not exceed the contact hours credited per day for the multidistrict class instructional arrangement in the 1992-1993 school year.

    (j)  A school district that provides an extended year program required by federal law for special education students who may regress is entitled to receive funds in an amount equal to 75 percent, or a lesser percentage determined by the commissioner, of the basic allotment, or, if applicable, the sum of the basic allotment and the allotment under Section [48.101](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.101) to which the district is entitled for each full-time equivalent student in average daily attendance, multiplied by the amount designated for the student's instructional arrangement under this section, for each day the program is provided divided by the number of days in the minimum school year.  The total amount of state funding for extended year services under this section may not exceed $10 million per year.  A school district may use funds received under this section only in providing an extended year program.
    
    (k)  From the total amount of funds appropriated for special education under this section, the commissioner shall withhold an amount specified in the General Appropriations Act, and distribute that amount to school districts for programs under Section [29.014](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=29.014).  The program established under that section is required only in school districts in which the program is financed by funds distributed under this subsection and any other funds available for the program.  After deducting the amount withheld under this subsection from the total amount appropriated for special education, the commissioner shall reduce each district's allotment proportionately and shall allocate funds to each district accordingly.

The agency shall provide to school districts a resource for use in determining the census block group in which a student resides.
    
    (j)  The commissioner shall adopt rules for the method of determining the number of students who qualify for an allotment under this section at a campus that participates in the Community Eligibility Provision administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, as provided by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (Pub.

    (A)  at least 90 percent of each allotment received under Subsection (c) was used for the compensation of teachers employed at the campus at which the teacher for whom the district received the allotment is employed; and
    
    (B)  any other funds received under this section were used for costs associated with implementing Section [21.3521](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=21.3521), including efforts to support teachers in obtaining designations; and
    
    (2)  the district prioritized high needs campuses in the district in using funds received under this section.
    
    (j)  The Texas School for the Deaf and the Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired are entitled to an allotment under this section.

    (A)  resides two or more miles from the student's campus of regular attendance, measured along the shortest route that may be traveled on public roads, and who is not classified as a student eligible for special education services; or
    
    (B)  is a homeless child or youth, as defined by 42 U.S.C. Section 11434a.
    
    (2)  "Eligible special education student" means a student who is eligible for special education services under Section [29.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=29.003) and who would be unable to attend classes without special transportation services.
    
    (c)  Each district or county operating a regular transportation system is entitled to an allotment based on a rate per mile per regular eligible student set by the legislature in the General Appropriations Act.
    
    (d)  A district or county may apply for and on approval of the commissioner receive an additional amount of up to 10 percent of its regular transportation allotment to be used for the transportation of children living within two miles of the school they attend who would be subject to hazardous traffic conditions or a high risk of violence if they walked to school.
    
    (d-1)  For purposes of Subsection (d), each board of trustees shall provide to the commissioner an explanation of the hazardous traffic conditions or areas presenting a high risk of violence applicable to that district and shall identify the specific hazardous or high-risk areas for which the allocation is requested.  A hazardous traffic condition exists where no walkway is provided and children must walk along or cross a freeway or expressway, an underpass, an overpass or a bridge, an uncontrolled major traffic artery, an industrial or commercial area, or another comparable condition.  An area presents a high risk of violence if law enforcement records indicate a high incidence of violent crimes in the area.  Each board of trustees requesting funds for an area presenting a high risk of violence must, in addition to the explanation required by this subsection, provide the commissioner with consolidated law enforcement records that document violent crimes identified by reporting agencies within the relevant jurisdiction.
    
    (d-2)  A district or county may use all or part of any funds received under Subsection (d) to support community walking transportation programs, including walking school bus programs, provided that the district or county requires each supported program to submit a financial report to the district or county each semester that covers services provided by the program for the benefit of the district or county.  The commissioner shall adopt rules governing the transportation allotment as necessary to permit a district or county to receive funds under Subsection (d) that may be used to support innovative school safety projects, including community walking transportation programs as provided by this subsection and any other appropriate safety project, including rules defining an approved walking route mile that may be used as necessary in implementing this subsection.
    
    (e)  The commissioner may grant an amount set by appropriation for private or commercial transportation for eligible students from isolated areas.  The need for this type of transportation grant shall be determined on an individual basis and the amount granted shall not exceed the actual cost.  The grants may be made only in extreme hardship cases.  A grant may not be made if the students live within two miles of an approved school bus route.
    
    (f)  The cost of transporting career and technology education students from one campus to another inside a district, from a sending district to another secondary public school for a career and technology program or an area career and technology school or to an approved post-secondary institution under a contract for instruction approved by the agency, or from a district campus to a location at which students are provided work-based learning under the district's career and technology program shall be reimbursed based on the number of actual miles traveled times the district's official extracurricular travel per mile rate as set by the board of trustees and approved by the agency.
    
    (g)  A school district or county that provides special transportation services for eligible special education students is entitled to a state allocation paid on a previous year's cost-per-mile basis.  The rate per mile allowable shall be set by appropriation based on data gathered from the first year of each preceding biennium. Districts may use a portion of their support allocation to pay transportation costs, if necessary.  The commissioner may grant an amount set by appropriation for private transportation to reimburse parents or their agents for transporting eligible special education students. The mileage allowed shall be computed along the shortest public road from the student's home to school and back, morning and afternoon.  The need for this type transportation shall be determined on an individual basis and shall be approved only in extreme hardship cases.
    
    (h)  Funds allotted under this section must be used in providing transportation services.  Transporting a meal or instructional materials as provided by Subsection (n) is included in transportation services under this subsection.
    
    (i)  In the case of a district belonging to a county transportation system, the district's transportation allotment for purposes of determining a district's foundation school program allocations is determined on the basis of the number of approved daily route miles in the district.
    
    (j)  The Texas School for the Deaf is entitled to an allotment under this section.  The commissioner shall determine the appropriate allotment.
    
    (k)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the commissioner may not reduce the allotment to which a district or county is entitled under this section because the district or county provides transportation for an eligible student to and from a child-care facility, as defined by Section [42.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HR&Value=42.002), Human Resources Code, or a grandparent's residence instead of the student's residence, as authorized by Section [34.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=34.007) of this code.
    
    (l)  A school district may, with the funds allotted under this section, provide a bus pass or card for another transportation system to each student who is eligible to use the regular transportation system of the district but for whom the regular transportation system of the district is not a feasible method of providing transportation. The commissioner by rule shall provide procedures for a school district to provide bus passes or cards to students under this subsection.
    
    (m)  A school district shall be reimbursed on a per-mile basis for the cost of transporting a dual credit student to another campus in the district, a campus in another district, or a postsecondary educational institution for purposes of attending the course, if the course is not available at the student's campus.
    
    (n)  For the duration of a declared disaster, a school district located in an area that is wholly or partly the subject of a disaster declaration by the governor under Chapter [418](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=418), Government Code, or by the president of the United States may be reimbursed on a per-mile basis for the cost of transporting a meal or instructional materials to a student's residence or to another location, designated by the district, for pick up by the student.

    Sec. 48.202. TIER TWO ALLOTMENT.  (a) Each school district is guaranteed a specified amount per weighted student in state and local funds for each cent of tax effort over that required for the district's local fund assignment up to the maximum level specified in this subchapter. The amount of state support, subject only to the maximum amount under Section [48.203](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.203), is determined by the formula:
    
    GYA = (GL X WADA X DTR X 100) - LR
    
      
    
    
    where:
    
    "GYA" is the guaranteed yield amount of state funds to be allocated to the district;
    
    "GL" is the dollar amount guaranteed level of state and local funds per weighted student per cent of tax effort, which is an amount described by Subsection (a-1) or a greater amount for any year provided by appropriation;
    
    "WADA" is the number of students in weighted average daily attendance, which is calculated by dividing the sum of the school district's allotments under Subchapters B and C by the basic allotment for the applicable year;
    
    "DTR" is the district enrichment tax rate of the school district, which is determined by subtracting the amounts specified by Subsection (b) from the total amount of maintenance and operations taxes collected by the school district for the applicable school year and dividing the difference by the quotient of the district's taxable value of property as determined under Subchapter [M](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=403.301), Chapter [403](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=403), Government Code, or, if applicable, under Section [48.258](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.258) or by the quotient of the value of "DPV" as determined under Section [48.256](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.256)(d) if that subsection applies to the district, divided by 100; and
    
    "LR" is the local revenue, which is determined by multiplying "DTR" by the quotient of the district's taxable value of property as determined under Subchapter [M](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=403.301), Chapter [403](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=403), Government Code, or, if applicable, under Section [48.258](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.258) or by the quotient of the value of "DPV" as determined under Section [48.256](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.256)(d) if that subsection applies to the district, divided by 100.
    
    (a-1)  For purposes of Subsection (a), the dollar amount guaranteed level of state and local funds per weighted student per cent of tax effort ("GL") for a school district is:
    
    (1)  the greater of the amount of district tax revenue per weighted student per cent of tax effort available to a school district at the 96th percentile of wealth per weighted student or the amount that results from multiplying 6,160, or the greater amount provided under Section [48.051](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.051)(b), if applicable, by 0.016, for the first eight cents by which the district's maintenance and operations tax rate exceeds the district's tier one tax rate; and
    
    (2)  subject to Subsection (f), the amount that results from multiplying $6,160, or the greater amount provided under Section [48.051](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.051)(b), if applicable, by 0.008, for the district's maintenance and operations tax effort that exceeds the amount of tax effort described by Subdivision (1).
    
    (a-2)  The limitation on district enrichment tax rate ("DTR") under Section [48.203](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.203) does not apply to the district's maintenance and operations tax effort described by Subsection (a-1)(1).
    
    (b)  In computing the district enrichment tax rate of a school district, the total amount of maintenance and operations taxes collected by the school district does not include the amount of:
    
    (1)  the district's local fund assignment under Section [48.256](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.256); or
    
    (2)  taxes paid into a tax increment fund under Chapter [311](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=311), Tax Code.
    
    (c)  For purposes of this section, school district taxes for which credit is granted under Section [31.035](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=31.035), [31.036](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=31.036), or [31.037](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=31.037), Tax Code, are considered taxes collected by the school district as if the taxes were paid when the credit for the taxes was granted.
    
    (d)  For purposes of this section, the total amount of maintenance and operations taxes collected for an applicable school year by a school district with alternate tax dates, as authorized by Section [26.135](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.135), Tax Code, is the amount of taxes collected on or after January 1 of the year in which the school year begins and not later than December 31 of the same year.
    
    (e)  For purposes of this section, school district taxes for which credit is granted under former Subchapter D, Chapter [313](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=313), Tax Code, are considered taxes collected by the school district as if the taxes were paid when the credit for the taxes was granted.
    
    (e-1)  For purposes of this section, the total amount of maintenance and operations taxes collected by a school district includes the amount of taxes refunded under Section [26.1115](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.1115)(c), Tax Code.
    
    (f)  For a school year in which the dollar amount guaranteed level of state and local funds per weighted student per cent of tax effort ("GL") under Subsection (a-1)(2) exceeds the dollar amount guaranteed level of state and local funds per weighted student per cent of tax effort ("GL") under Subsection (a-1)(2) for the preceding school year, a school district shall reduce the district's tax rate under Section [45.0032](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=45.0032)(b)(2) for the tax year that corresponds to that school year to a rate that results in the amount of state and local funds per weighted student per cent of tax effort available to the district at the dollar amount guaranteed level for the preceding school year.  A school district is not entitled to the amount equal to the increase of revenue described by this subsection for the school year for which the district must reduce the district's tax rate.  Unless Section [26.042](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=26.042)(e), Tax Code, applies to the district, for a tax year in which a district must reduce the district's tax rate under this subsection, the district may not increase the district's maintenance and operations tax rate to a rate that exceeds the maximum maintenance and operations tax rate permitted under Section [45.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=45.003)(d) or (f), as applicable, minus the reduction of tax effort required under this subsection.  This subsection does not apply if the amount of state funds appropriated for a school year specifically excludes the amount necessary to provide the dollar amount guaranteed level of state and local funds per weighted student per cent of tax effort under Subsection (a-1)(2).

Any amount of state aid used as an offset under this subsection shall reduce the amount of state aid to which the district is entitled.
    
    (d)  Except as provided by Subsection (e), a school district is entitled to retain the total amount of the district's tier two local share described by Section [48.266](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.266)(a)(5)(A).

    (f)  If the amount of a school district's tier two local share described by Section [48.266](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.266)(a)(5)(B) to which a district is entitled exceeds the amount described by Section [48.202](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.202)(a-1)(2), the district must reduce the district's revenue in accordance with Chapter [49](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=49) to a level not to exceed the amount described by Section [48.202](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.202) (a-1)(2).
    
    (g)  For a district to which Section [45.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=45.003)(f) applies, revenue generated from any cents of maintenance and operations tax effort that exceeds the maximum rate permitted under Section [45.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=45.003)(d) is subject to the revenue limit established under Subsection (f).

(a)  In any school year, the commissioner may not provide funding under this chapter or Chapter [46](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=46) based on a school district's taxable value of property computed in accordance with Section [403.302](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=403.302)(d)(2), Government Code, unless:
    
    (1)  funds are specifically appropriated for purposes of this section; or
    
    (2)  the commissioner determines that the total amount of state funds appropriated for purposes of the Foundation School Program for the school year exceeds the amount of state funds distributed to school districts in accordance with Section [48.266](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.266) based on the taxable values of property in school districts computed in accordance with Section [403.302](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=403.302)(d), Government Code, without any deduction for residence homestead exemptions granted under Section [11.13](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&Value=11.13)(n), Tax Code.

    (d)  If the commissioner determines that the amount of funds available under Subsection (a)(1) or (2) does not at least equal the total amount of state funding to which districts would be entitled if state funding under this chapter were based on the taxable values of property in school districts computed in accordance with Section [403.302](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=403.302)(d)(2), Government Code, the commissioner may, to the extent necessary, provide state funding based on a uniform lesser fraction of the deduction under Section [403.302](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=403.302)(d)(2), Government Code.

    (b)  During the two-year period following the date of the governor's initial proclamation or executive order declaring a state of disaster, a district may apply to the commissioner for reimbursement of disaster remediation costs that the district pays during that period and does not anticipate recovering through insurance proceeds, federal disaster relief payments, or another similar source of reimbursement.
    
    (c)  The commissioner may provide reimbursement under this section only if funds are available for that purpose from:

    (2)  the amount of money to which a school district is entitled under Subchapter E;
    
    (3)  the amount of money allocated to the district from the available school fund;
    
    (4)  the amount of each district's tier one local share under Section [48.256](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.256); and
    
    (5)  the amount of each district's tier two local share under Section [48.202](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.202) for:
    
    (A)  the district's maintenance and operations tax effort described by Section [48.202](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.202)(a-1)(1); and
    
    (B)  the district's maintenance and operations tax effort described by Section [48.202](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.202)(a-1)(2).
    
    (b)  Except as provided by this subsection, the commissioner shall base the determinations under Subsection (a) on the estimates provided to the legislature under Section [48.269](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.269), or, if the General Appropriations Act provides estimates for that purpose, on the estimates provided under that Act, for each school district for each school year.  The commissioner shall reduce the entitlement of each district that has a final taxable value of property for the second year of a state fiscal biennium that is higher than the estimate under Section [48.269](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.269) or the General Appropriations Act, as applicable.  A reduction under this subsection may not reduce the district's entitlement below the amount to which it is entitled at its actual taxable value of property.
    
    (c)  Each school district is entitled to an amount equal to the difference for that district between the sum of Subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) and the sum of Subsections (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(5).
    
    (d)  The commissioner shall approve warrants to each school district equaling the amount of its entitlement except as provided by this section.  Warrants for all money expended according to this chapter shall be approved and transmitted to treasurers or depositories of school districts in the same manner that warrants for state payments are transmitted.  The total amount of the warrants issued under this section may not exceed the total amount appropriated for Foundation School Program purposes for that fiscal year.
    
    (e)  If a school district demonstrates to the satisfaction of the commissioner that the estimate of the district's tax rate, student enrollment, or taxable value of property used in determining the amount of state funds to which the district is entitled are so inaccurate as to result in undue financial hardship to the district, the commissioner may adjust funding to that district in that school year to the extent that funds are available for that year.
    
    (f)  If the amount appropriated for the Foundation School Program for the second year of a state fiscal biennium is less than the amount to which school districts and open-enrollment charter schools are entitled for that year, the commissioner shall certify the amount of the difference to the Legislative Budget Board not later than January 1 of the second year of the state fiscal biennium.  The Legislative Budget Board shall propose to the legislature that the certified amount be transferred to the foundation school fund from the economic stabilization fund and appropriated for the purpose of increases in allocations under this subsection.  If the legislature fails during the regular session to enact the proposed transfer and appropriation and there are not funds available under Subsection (h), the commissioner shall adjust the total amounts due to each school district and open-enrollment charter school under this chapter and the total amounts necessary for each school district to comply with the requirements of Chapter [49](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=49) by an amount determined by applying to each district and school the same percentage adjustment to the total amount of state and local revenue due to the district or school under this chapter and Chapter [49](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=49) so that the total amount of the adjustment to all districts and schools results in an amount equal to the total adjustment necessary.  The following fiscal year:
    
    (1)  a district's or school's entitlement under this section is increased by an amount equal to the adjustment  made under this subsection; and
    
    (2)  the amount necessary for a district to comply with the requirements of Chapter [49](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=49) is reduced by an amount necessary to ensure a district's full recovery of the adjustment made under this subsection.
