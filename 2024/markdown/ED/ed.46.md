The amount of state support is determined by the formula:
    
    FYA = (FYL X ADA X BTR X 100) - (BTR X (DPV/100))

    "DPV" is the district's taxable value of property as determined under Subchapter [M](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=403.301), Chapter [403](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=403), Government Code, or, if applicable, Section [48.258](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.258).
    
    (b)  The bond tax rate under Subsection (a) may not exceed the rate that would be necessary for the current year, using state funds under Subsection (a), to make payments of principal and interest on the bonds for which the tax is pledged.
    
    (c)  To enable the district to collect local funds sufficient to pay the district's share of the debt service, a district may levy a bond tax at a rate higher than the maximum rate for which it may receive state assistance.
    
    (d)  The amount budgeted by a district for payment of eligible bonds may include:
    
    (1)  bond taxes collected in the current school year;
    
    (2)  bond taxes collected in a preceding school year in excess of the amount necessary to pay the district's share of actual debt service on bonds in that year, provided that the taxes were not used to generate other state financial assistance for the district;  or
    
    (3)  maintenance and operations taxes collected in the current school year or a preceding school year in excess of the amount eligible to be used to generate other state financial assistance for the district.
    
    (e)  Bonds are eligible to be paid with state and local funds under this section if:
    
    (1)  taxes to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds were first levied in the 1997-1998 school year or a later school year;  and
    
    (2)  the bonds do not have a weighted average maturity of less than eight years.
    
    (f)  A district may use state funds received under this section only to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds for which the district received the funds.
    
    (g)  The board of trustees and voters of a school district shall determine district needs concerning construction, acquisition, renovation, or improvement of instructional facilities.
    
    (h)  To receive state assistance under this subchapter, a school district must apply to the commissioner in accordance with rules adopted by the commissioner before issuing bonds that will be paid with state assistance.  Until the bonds are fully paid or the instructional facility is sold:
    
    (1)  a school district is entitled to continue receiving state assistance without reapplying to the commissioner;  and
    
    (2)  the guaranteed level of state and local funds per student per cent of tax effort applicable to the bonds may not be reduced below the level provided for the year in which the bonds were issued.

(a)  If the total amount appropriated for a year for new projects is less than the amount of money to which school districts applying for state assistance are entitled for that year, the commissioner shall rank each school district applying by wealth per student.  For purposes of this section, a district's wealth per student is reduced by 10 percent for each state fiscal biennium in which the district did not receive assistance under this subchapter.
    
    (b)  A district's wealth per student is reduced for purposes of this section if a district has had substantial student enrollment growth in the preceding five-year period.  The reduction is in addition to any reduction under Subsection (a) and is computed before the district's wealth per student is reduced under that subsection, if applicable.  A district's wealth per student is reduced:
    
    (1)  by five percent, if the district has an enrollment growth rate in that period that is 10 percent or more but less than 15 percent;
    
    (2)  by 10 percent, if the district has an enrollment growth rate in that period that is 15 percent or more but less than 30 percent;  or
    
    (3)  by 15 percent, if the district has an enrollment growth rate in that period that is 30 percent or more.
    
    (c)  A district's wealth per student is reduced by 10 percent for purposes of this section if the district does not have any outstanding debt at the time the district applies for assistance under this subchapter.  The reduction is in addition to any reduction under Subsection (a) or (b) and is computed before the district's wealth per student is reduced under those subsections, if applicable.
    
    (d)  The commissioner shall adjust the rankings after making the reductions in wealth per student required by Subsections (a), (b), and (c).
    
    (e)  Beginning with the district with the lowest adjusted wealth per student that has applied for state assistance for the year, the commissioner shall award state assistance to districts that have applied for state assistance in ascending order of adjusted wealth per student.  The commissioner shall award the full amount of state assistance to which a district is entitled under this subchapter, except that the commissioner may award less than the full amount to the last district for which any funds are available.
    
    (f)  Any amount appropriated for the first year of a fiscal biennium that is not awarded to a school district may be used to provide assistance in the following fiscal year.
    
    (g)  In this section, "wealth per student" means a school district's taxable value of property as determined under Subchapter [M](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=403.301), Chapter [403](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=403), Government Code, or, if applicable, Section [48.258](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.258), divided by the district's average daily attendance as determined under Section [48.005](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.005).

(a)  Beginning with the 2015-2016 school year and continuing through the 2021-2022 school year, a school district is entitled to additional state aid under this subchapter to the extent that state and local revenue used to service debt eligible under this chapter is less than the state and local revenue that would have been available to the district under this chapter as it existed on September 1, 2015, if the increase in the residence homestead exemption under Section [1-b](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=8.1-b)(c), Article VIII, Texas Constitution, and the additional limitation on tax increases under Section 1-b(d) of that article as proposed by S.J.R. 1, 84th Legislature, Regular Session, 2015, had not occurred.
    
    (a-1)  For the 2022-2023 school year, a school district is entitled to additional state aid under this subchapter to the extent that state and local revenue used to service debt eligible under this chapter is less than the state and local revenue that would have been available to the district under this chapter as it existed on September 1, 2021, if any increase in the residence homestead exemption under Section [1-b](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=8.1-b)(c), Article VIII, Texas Constitution, as proposed by the 87th Legislature, 3rd Called Session, 2021, had not occurred.
    
    (a-2)  Beginning with the 2023-2024 school year, a school district is entitled to additional state aid under this subchapter to the extent that state and local revenue used to service debt eligible under this chapter is less than the state and local revenue that would have been available to the district under this chapter as it existed on September 1, 2022, if any increase in a residence homestead exemption under Section [1-b](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=CN&Value=8.1-b)(c), Article VIII, Texas Constitution, and any additional limitation on tax increases under Section 1-b(d) of that article as proposed by the 88th Legislature, 2nd Called Session, 2023, had not occurred.

The limitation imposed by Section [46.034](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=46.034)(a) does not apply for the purpose of determining state aid under this section.
    
    (d)  If the amount required to pay debt service eligible under this section is less than the sum of state and local assistance provided under this chapter, including the amount of additional aid provided under this section, the district may not receive aid under this section in excess of the amount that, when added to the district's local interest and sinking revenue for debt service for the school year, as defined by this section, and state aid under Subchapters A and B, equals the amount required to pay the eligible debt service.

A determination by the commissioner under this section is final and may not be appealed.
