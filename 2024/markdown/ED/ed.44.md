Following adoption of the tax rate, the district must publish notice and hold another public meeting before the district may adopt a budget.  The comptroller shall prescribe the language and format to be used in the notices.  The school district may use the certified estimate of taxable value in preparing a notice under this subsection.

    (b)  Except as provided by this subchapter, in determining to whom to award a contract, the district shall consider:

    (f)  This section does not apply to a contract for professional services rendered, including services of an architect, attorney, certified public accountant, engineer, or fiscal agent.

    (h)  If school equipment or a part of a school facility or personal property is destroyed or severely damaged or, as a result of an unforeseen catastrophe or emergency, undergoes major operational or structural failure, and the board of trustees determines that the delay posed by the methods provided for in this section would prevent or substantially impair the conduct of classes or other essential school activities, then contracts for the replacement or repair of the equipment or the part of the school facility may be made by methods other than those required by this section.
    
    (i)  A school district may acquire computers and computer-related equipment, including computer software, through the Department of Information Resources under contracts entered into in accordance with Chapter [2054](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2054) or [2157](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2157), Government Code.  Before issuing an invitation for bids, the department shall consult with the agency concerning the computer and computer-related equipment needs of school districts.

    (j)  Without complying with Subsection (a), a school district may purchase an item that is available from only one source, including:
    
    (1)  an item for which competition is precluded because of the existence of a patent, copyright, secret process, or monopoly;
    
    (2)  a film, manuscript, or book;

    (m)  If a purchase is made at the campus level in a school district with a student enrollment of 180,000 or more that has formally adopted a site-based decision-making plan under Subchapter [F](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=11.251), Chapter [11](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=11), that delegates purchasing decisions to the campus level, this section applies only to the campus and does not require the district to aggregate and jointly award purchasing contracts.  A district that adopts site-based purchasing under this subsection shall adopt a policy to ensure that campus purchases achieve the best value to the district and are not intended or used to avoid the requirement that a district aggregate purchases under Subsection (a).

    (e)  Before entering into an energy savings performance contract, the board shall require the provider of the energy or water conservation measures to file with the board a payment and performance bond relating to the installation of the measures in accordance with Chapter [2253](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2253), Government Code.  The board may also require a separate bond to cover the value of the guaranteed savings on the contract.
    
    (f)  An energy savings performance contract may be financed:
    
    (1)  under a lease/purchase contract that has a term not to exceed 20 years from the final date of installation and that meets federal tax requirements for tax-free municipal leasing or long-term financing;
    
    (2)  with the proceeds of bonds; or
    
    (3)  under a contract with the provider of the energy or water conservation measures that has a term not to exceed the lesser of 20 years from the final date of installation or the average useful life of the energy or water conservation or usage measures.
    
    (f-1)  Notwithstanding other law, the board may use any available money to pay the provider of the energy or water conservation measures under this section, and the board is not required to pay for such costs solely out of the savings realized by the school district under an energy savings performance contract.  The board may contract with the provider to perform work that is related to, connected with, or otherwise ancillary to the measures identified in the scope of an energy savings performance contract.
    
    (g)  An energy savings performance contract shall contain provisions requiring the provider of the energy or water conservation measures to guarantee the amount of the savings to be realized by the school district under the contract.  If the term of an energy savings performance contract exceeds one year, the school district's contractual obligations in any one year during the term of the contract beginning after the final date of installation may not exceed the total energy, water, wastewater, and operating cost savings, including electrical, gas, water, wastewater, or other utility cost savings and operating cost savings resulting from the measures, as determined by the school district in this subsection, divided by the number of years in the contract term.
    
    (h)  An energy savings performance contract shall be let according to the procedures established for procuring certain professional services by Section [2254.004](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2254.004), Government Code. Notice of the request for qualifications shall be published in the manner provided for competitive bidding.
    
    (i)  Before entering into an energy savings performance contract, the board must require that the cost savings projected by an offeror be reviewed by a licensed professional engineer who has a minimum of three years of experience in energy calculation and review, is not an officer or employee of an offeror for the contract under review, and is not otherwise associated with the contract.  In conducting the review, the engineer shall focus primarily on the proposed improvements from an engineering perspective, the methodology and calculations related to cost savings, increases in revenue, and, if applicable, efficiency or accuracy of metering equipment.  An engineer who reviews a contract shall maintain the confidentiality of any proprietary information the engineer acquires while reviewing the contract.  Sections [1001.053](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=1001.053) and [1001.407](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=1001.407), Occupations Code, apply to work performed under the contract.
    
    (j)  Chapter [2269](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2269), Government Code, does not apply to this section.
