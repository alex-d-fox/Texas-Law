    (a-1)  The agency shall adopt minimum standards for the operation of disciplinary alternative education programs, including standards relating to:
    
    (1)  student/teacher ratios;
    
    (2)  student health and safety;
    
    (3)  reporting of abuse, neglect, or exploitation of students;
    
    (4)  training for teachers in behavior management and safety procedures; and
    
    (5)  planning for a student's transition from a disciplinary alternative education program to a regular campus.
    
    (b)  A disciplinary alternative education program may provide for a student's transfer to:
    
    (1)  a different campus;
    
    (2)  a school-community guidance center;  or
    
    (3)  a community-based alternative school.
    
    (c)  An off-campus disciplinary alternative education program is not subject to a requirement imposed by this title, other than a limitation on liability, a reporting requirement, or a requirement imposed by this chapter or by Chapter [39](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39) or [39A](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39A).

    (h)  A school district may not place a student, other than a student suspended as provided under Section [37.005](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.005) or expelled as provided under Section [37.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.007), in an unsupervised setting as a result of conduct for which a student may be placed in a disciplinary alternative education program.
    
    (i)  On request of a school district, a regional education service center may provide to the district information on developing a disciplinary alternative education program that takes into consideration the district's size, wealth, and existing facilities in determining the program best suited to the district.

    (A)  the out-of-state district provides to the district a copy of the placement order; and
    
    (B)  the grounds for the placement by the out-of-state district are grounds for placement in the district in which the student is enrolling.
    
    (j-1)  If a student was placed in a disciplinary alternative education program by a school district in another state for a period that exceeds one year and a school district in this state in which the student enrolls continues the placement under Subsection (j), the district shall reduce the period of the placement so that the aggregate period does not exceed one year unless, after a review, the district determines that:
    
    (1)  the student is a threat to the safety of other students or to district employees;  or
    
    (2)  extended placement is in the best interest of the student.
    
    (k)  A program of educational and support services may be provided to a student and the student's parents when the offense involves drugs, e-cigarettes, or alcohol as specified under Section [37.006](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.006) or [37.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.007).

    (l-1)  A school district shall provide the parents of a student removed to a disciplinary alternative education program with written notice of the district's obligation under Subsection (l) to provide the student with an opportunity to complete coursework required for graduation.  The notice must:
    
    (1)  include information regarding all methods available for completing the coursework; and
    
    (2)  state that the methods are available at no cost to the student.
    
    (m)  The commissioner shall adopt rules necessary to evaluate annually the performance of each district's disciplinary alternative education program established under this subchapter.

Academically, the mission of disciplinary alternative education programs shall be to enable students to perform at grade level.
    
    (m-1)  The commissioner shall develop a process for evaluating a school district disciplinary alternative education program electronically.  The commissioner shall also develop a system and standards for review of the evaluation or use systems already available at the agency.  The system must be designed to identify districts that are at high risk of having inaccurate disciplinary alternative education program data or of failing to comply with disciplinary alternative education program requirements.  The commissioner shall notify the board of trustees of a district of any objection the commissioner has to the district's disciplinary alternative education program data or of a violation of a law or rule revealed by the data, including any violation of disciplinary alternative education program requirements, or of any recommendation by the commissioner concerning the data.  If the data reflect that a penal law has been violated, the commissioner shall notify the county attorney, district attorney, or criminal district attorney, as appropriate, and the attorney general.  The commissioner is entitled to access to all district records the commissioner considers necessary or appropriate for the review, analysis, or approval of disciplinary alternative education program data.

    Sec. 37.009.  CONFERENCE;  HEARING;  REVIEW.
    
    (a)  Not later than the third class day after the day on which a student is removed from class by the teacher under Section [37.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.002)(b) or (d) or by the school principal or other appropriate administrator under Section [37.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.001)(a)(2) or [37.006](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.006), the campus behavior coordinator or other appropriate administrator shall schedule a conference among the campus behavior coordinator or other appropriate administrator, a parent or guardian of the student, the teacher removing the student from class, if any, and the student.  At the conference, the student is entitled to written or oral notice of the reasons for the removal, an explanation of the basis for the removal, and an opportunity to respond to the reasons for the removal.  The student may not be returned to the regular classroom pending the conference.  Following the conference, and whether or not each requested person is in attendance after valid attempts to require the person's attendance, the campus behavior coordinator, after consideration of the factors under Section [37.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.001)(a)(4), shall order the placement of the student for a period consistent with the student code of conduct.  Before ordering the suspension, expulsion, removal to a disciplinary alternative education program, or placement in a juvenile justice alternative education program of a student, the behavior coordinator must consider whether the student acted in self-defense, the intent or lack of intent at the time the student engaged in the conduct, the student's disciplinary history, and whether the student has a disability that substantially impairs the student's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of the student's conduct, regardless of whether the decision of the behavior coordinator concerns a mandatory or discretionary action.  If school district policy allows a student to appeal to the board of trustees or the board's designee a decision of the campus behavior coordinator or other appropriate administrator, other than an expulsion under Section [37.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.007), the decision of the board or the board's designee is final and may not be appealed.  If the period of the placement is inconsistent with the guidelines included in the student code of conduct under Section [37.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.001)(a)(5), the order must give notice of the inconsistency.  The period of the placement may not exceed one year unless, after a review, the district determines that the student is a threat to the safety of other students or to district employees.
    
    (a-1)  If a disciplinary alternative education program is at capacity at the time a campus behavior coordinator is deciding placement under Subsection (a) for a student who engaged in conduct described under Section [37.006](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.006)(a)(2)(C-1), (C-2), (D), or (E), the student shall be:
    
    (1)  placed in in-school suspension; and
    
    (2)  if a position becomes available in the program before the expiration of the period of the placement, transferred to the program for the remainder of the period.
    
    (a-2)  If a disciplinary alternative education program is at capacity at the time a campus behavior coordinator is deciding placement under Subsection (a) for a student who engaged in conduct described under Section [37.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.007) that constitutes violent conduct, as defined by commissioner rule, a student who has been placed in the program for conduct described under Section [37.006](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.006)(a)(2)(C-1), (C-2), (D), or (E):
    
    (1)  may be removed from the program and placed in in-school suspension to make a position in the program available for the student who engaged in violent conduct; and
    
    (2)  if removed from the program under Subdivision (1) and a position in the program becomes available before the expiration of the period of the placement, shall be returned to the program for the remainder of the period.
    
    (b)  If a student's placement in a disciplinary alternative education program is to extend beyond 60 days or the end of the next grading period, whichever is earlier, a student's parent or guardian is entitled to notice of and an opportunity to participate in a proceeding before the board of trustees of the school district or the board's designee, as provided by policy of the board of trustees of the district.  Any decision of the board or the board's designee under this subsection is final and may not be appealed.
    
    (c)  Before it may place a student in a disciplinary alternative education program for a period that extends beyond the end of the school year, the board or the board's designee must determine that:
    
    (1)  the student's presence in the regular classroom program or at the student's regular campus presents a danger of physical harm to the student or to another individual;  or
    
    (2)  the student has engaged in serious or persistent misbehavior that violates the district's student code of conduct.
    
    (d)  The board or the board's designee shall set a term for a student's placement in a disciplinary alternative education program.  If the period of the placement is inconsistent with the guidelines included in the student code of conduct under Section [37.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.001)(a)(5), the order must give notice of the inconsistency.  The period of the placement may not exceed one year unless, after a review, the district determines that:
    
    (1)  the student is a threat to the safety of other students or to district employees;  or
    
    (2)  extended placement is in the best interest of the student.
    
    (e)  A student placed in a disciplinary alternative education program shall be provided a review of the student's status, including a review of the student's academic status, by the board's designee at intervals not to exceed 120 days.  In the case of a high school student, the board's designee, with the student's parent or guardian, shall review the student's progress towards meeting high school graduation requirements and shall establish a specific graduation plan for the student.  The district is not required under this subsection to provide a course in the district's disciplinary alternative education program except as required by Section [37.008](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.008)(l).  At the review, the student or the student's parent or guardian must be given the opportunity to present arguments for the student's return to the regular classroom or campus.  The student may not be returned to the classroom of the teacher who removed the student without that teacher's consent.  The teacher may not be coerced to consent.
    
    (f)  Before a student may be expelled under Section [37.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.007), the board or the board's designee must provide the student a hearing at which the student is afforded appropriate due process as required by the federal constitution and which the student's parent or guardian is invited, in writing, to attend.  At the hearing, the student is entitled to be represented by the student's parent or guardian or another adult who can provide guidance to the student and who is not an employee of the school district.  If the school district makes a good-faith effort to inform the student and the student's parent or guardian of the time and place of the hearing, the district may hold the hearing regardless of whether the student, the student's parent or guardian, or another adult representing the student attends.  Before ordering the expulsion of a student, the board of trustees must consider whether the student acted in self-defense, the intent or lack of intent at the time the student engaged in the conduct, the student's disciplinary history, and whether the student has a disability that substantially impairs the student's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of the student's conduct, regardless of whether the decision of the board concerns a mandatory or discretionary action. If the decision to expel a student is made by the board's designee, the decision may be appealed to the board.  The decision of the board may be appealed by trial de novo to a district court of the county in which the school district's central administrative office is located.
    
    (g)  The board or the board's designee shall deliver to the student and the student's parent or guardian a copy of the order placing the student in a disciplinary alternative education program under Section [37.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.001), [37.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.002), or [37.006](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.006) or expelling the student under Section [37.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.007).
    
    (h)  If the period of an expulsion is inconsistent with the guidelines included in the student code of conduct under Section [37.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.001)(a)(5), the order must give notice of the inconsistency.  The period of an expulsion may not exceed one year unless, after a review, the district determines that:
    
    (1)  the student is a threat to the safety of other students or to district employees;  or
    
    (2)  extended placement is in the best interest of the student.  After a school district notifies the parents or guardians of a student that the student has been expelled, the parent or guardian shall provide adequate supervision of the student during the period of expulsion.
    
    (i)  If a student withdraws from the district before an order for placement in a disciplinary alternative education program or expulsion is entered under this section, the principal or board, as appropriate, may complete the proceedings and enter an order.  If the student subsequently enrolls in the district during the same or subsequent school year, the district may enforce the order at that time except for any period of the placement or expulsion that has been served by the student on enrollment in another district that honored the order.  If the principal or board fails to enter an order after the student withdraws, the next district in which the student enrolls may complete the proceedings and enter an order.
    
    (j)  If, during the term of a placement or expulsion ordered under this section, a student engages in additional conduct for which placement in a disciplinary alternative education program or expulsion is required or permitted, additional proceedings may be conducted under this section regarding that conduct and the principal or board, as appropriate, may enter an additional order as a result of those proceedings.

    Sec. 37.010.  COURT INVOLVEMENT.  (a)  Not later than the second business day after the date a hearing is held under Section [37.009](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.009), the board of trustees of a school district or the board's designee shall deliver a copy of the order placing a student in a disciplinary alternative education program under Section [37.006](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.006) or expelling a student under Section [37.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.007) and any information required under Section [52.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=52.04), Family Code, to the authorized officer of the juvenile court in the county in which the student resides.  In a county that operates a program under Section [37.011](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.011), an expelled student shall to the extent provided by law or by the memorandum of understanding immediately attend the educational program from the date of expulsion, except that in a county with a population greater than 125,000, every expelled student who is not detained or receiving treatment under an order of the juvenile court must be enrolled in an educational program.
    
    (b)  If a student is expelled under Section [37.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.007)(c), the board or its designee shall refer the student to the authorized officer of the juvenile court for appropriate proceedings under Title 3, Family Code.
    
    (c)  Unless the juvenile board for the county in which the district's central administrative office is located has entered into a memorandum of understanding with the district's board of trustees concerning the juvenile probation department's role in supervising and providing other support services for students in disciplinary alternative education programs, a court may not order a student expelled under Section [37.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.007) to attend a regular classroom, a regular campus, or a school district disciplinary alternative education program as a condition of probation.
    
    (d)  Unless the juvenile board for the county in which the district's central administrative office is located has entered into a memorandum of understanding as described by Subsection (c), if a court orders a student to attend a disciplinary alternative education program as a condition of probation once during a school year and the student is referred to juvenile court again during that school year, the juvenile court may not order the student to attend a disciplinary alternative education program in a district without the district's consent until the student has successfully completed any sentencing requirements the court imposes.
    
    (e)  Any placement in a disciplinary alternative education program by a court under this section must prohibit the student from attending or participating in school-sponsored or school-related activities.
    
    (f)  If a student is expelled under Section [37.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.007), on the recommendation of the committee established under Section [37.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.003) or on its own initiative, a district may readmit the student while the student is completing any court disposition requirements the court imposes.  After the student has successfully completed any court disposition requirements the court imposes, including conditions of a deferred prosecution ordered by the court, or such conditions required by the prosecutor or probation department, if the student meets the requirements for admission into the public schools established by this title, a district may not refuse to admit the student, but the district may place the student in the disciplinary alternative education program.  Notwithstanding Section [37.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.002)(d), the student may not be returned to the classroom of the teacher under whose supervision the offense occurred without that teacher's consent.  The teacher may not be coerced to consent.
    
    (g)  If an expelled student enrolls in another school district, the board of trustees of the district that expelled the student shall provide to the district in which the student enrolls, at the same time other records of the student are provided, a copy of the expulsion order and the referral to the authorized officer of the juvenile court.  The district in which the student enrolls may continue the expulsion under the terms of the order, may place the student in a disciplinary alternative education program for the period specified by the expulsion order, or may allow the student to attend regular classes without completing the period of expulsion.  A district may take any action permitted by this subsection if the student was expelled by a school district in another state if:
    
    (1)  the out-of-state district provides to the district a copy of the expulsion order;  and
    
    (2)  the grounds for the expulsion are also grounds for expulsion in the district in which the student is enrolling.
    
    (g-1)  If a student was expelled by a school district in another state for a period that exceeds one year and a school district in this state continues the expulsion or places the student in a disciplinary alternative education program under Subsection (g), the district shall reduce the period of the expulsion or placement so that the aggregate period does not exceed one year unless, after a review, the district determines that:
    
    (1)  the student is a threat to the safety of other students or to district employees;  or
    
    (2)  extended placement is in the best interest of the student.

(a)  The juvenile board of a county with a population greater than 125,000 shall develop a juvenile justice alternative education program, subject to the approval of the Texas Juvenile Justice Department.  The juvenile board of a county with a population of 125,000 or less may develop a juvenile justice alternative education program.  For the purposes of this subchapter, only a disciplinary alternative education program operated under the authority of a juvenile board of a county is considered a juvenile justice alternative education program.  A juvenile justice alternative education program in a county with a population of 125,000 or less:
    
    (1)  is not required to be approved by the department; and
    
    (2)  is not subject to Subsection (c), (d), (f), or (g).
    
    (a-1)  For purposes of this section and Section [37.010](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.010)(a), a county with a population greater than 125,000 is considered to be a county with a population of 125,000 or less if:
    
    (1)  the county had a population of 125,000 or less according to the 2000 federal census; and
    
    (2)  the juvenile board of the county enters into, with the approval of the Texas Juvenile Justice Department, a memorandum of understanding with each school district within the county that:
    
    (A)  outlines the responsibilities of the board and school districts in minimizing the number of students expelled without receiving alternative educational services; and
    
    (B)  includes the coordination procedures required by Section [37.013](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.013).
    
    (a-2)  For purposes of this section and Section [37.010](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.010)(a), a county with a population greater than 125,000 is considered to be a county with a population of 125,000 or less if the county:
    
    (1)  has a population of 195,000 or less;
    
    (2)  is adjacent to two counties, each of which has a population of more than 1.7 million; and
    
    (3)  has seven or more school districts located wholly within the county's boundaries.
    
    (a-3)  For purposes of this section and Section [37.010](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.010)(a), a county with a population greater than 125,000 is considered to be a county with a population of 125,000 or less if the county:
    
    (1)  has a population of more than 200,000 and less than 233,500;
    
    (2)  has five or more school districts located wholly within the county's boundaries; and
    
    (3)  has located in the county a juvenile justice alternative education program that, on May 1, 2011, served fewer than 15 students.
    
    (a-4)  A school district located in a county considered to be a county with a population of 125,000 or less under Subsection (a-3) shall provide educational services to a student who is expelled from school under this chapter.  The district is entitled to count the student in the district's average daily attendance for purposes of receipt of state funds under the Foundation School Program.  An educational placement under this section may include:
    
    (1)  the district's disciplinary alternative education program; or
    
    (2)  a contracted placement with:
    
    (A)  another school district;
    
    (B)  an open-enrollment charter school;
    
    (C)  an institution of higher education;
    
    (D)  an adult literacy council; or
    
    (E)  a community organization that can provide an educational program that allows the student to complete the credits required for high school graduation.
    
    (a-5)  For purposes of Subsection (a-4), an educational placement other than a school district's disciplinary alternative education program is subject to the educational and certification requirements applicable to an open-enrollment charter school under Subchapter [D](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=12.101), Chapter [12](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=12).
    
    (b)  If a student admitted into the public schools of a school district under Section [25.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=25.001)(b) is expelled from school for conduct for which expulsion is required under Section [37.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.007)(a), (d), or (e), or for conduct that contains the elements of the offense of terroristic threat as described by Section [22.07](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=22.07)(c-1), (d), or (e), Penal Code, the juvenile court, the juvenile board, or the juvenile board's designee, as appropriate, shall:
    
    (1)  if the student is placed on probation under Section [54.04](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=54.04), Family Code, order the student to attend the juvenile justice alternative education program in the county in which the student resides from the date of disposition as a condition of probation, unless the child is placed in a post-adjudication treatment facility;
    
    (2)  if the student is placed on deferred prosecution under Section [53.03](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=53.03), Family Code, by the court, prosecutor, or probation department, require the student to immediately attend the juvenile justice alternative education program in the county in which the student resides for a period not to exceed six months as a condition of the deferred prosecution;
    
    (3)  in determining the conditions of the deferred prosecution or court-ordered probation, consider the length of the school district's expulsion order for the student; and
    
    (4)  provide timely educational services to the student in the juvenile justice alternative education program in the county in which the student resides, regardless of the student's age or whether the juvenile court has jurisdiction over the student.
    
    (b-1)  Subsection (b)(4) does not require that educational services be provided to a student who is not entitled to admission into the public schools of a school district under Section [25.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=25.001)(b).
    
    (c)  A juvenile justice alternative education program shall adopt a student code of conduct in accordance with Section [37.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.001).
    
    (d)  A juvenile justice alternative education program must focus on English language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, and self-discipline.  Each school district shall consider course credit earned by a student while in a juvenile justice alternative education program as credit earned in a district school.  Each program shall administer assessment instruments under Subchapter [B](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39.021), Chapter [39](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39), and shall offer a high school equivalency program.  The juvenile board or the board's designee, with the parent or guardian of each student, shall regularly review the student's academic progress.  In the case of a high school student, the board or the board's designee, with the student's parent or guardian, shall review the student's progress towards meeting high school graduation requirements and shall establish a specific graduation plan for the student.  The program is not required to provide a course necessary to fulfill a student's high school graduation requirements other than a course specified by this subsection.
    
    (e)  A juvenile justice alternative education program may be provided in a facility owned by a school district.  A school district may provide personnel and services for a juvenile justice alternative education program under a contract with the juvenile board.
    
    (f)  A juvenile justice alternative education program must operate at least seven hours per day and 180 days per year, except that a program may apply to the Texas Juvenile Justice Department for a waiver of the 180-day requirement.  The department may not grant a waiver to a program under this subsection for a number of days that exceeds the highest number of instructional days waived by the commissioner during the same school year for a school district served by the program.
    
    (g)  A juvenile justice alternative education program shall be subject to a written operating policy developed by the local juvenile justice board and submitted to the Texas Juvenile Justice Department for review and comment.  A juvenile justice alternative education program is not subject to a requirement imposed by this title, other than a reporting requirement or a requirement imposed by this chapter or by Chapter [39](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39) or [39A](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39A).
    
    (h)  Academically, the mission of juvenile justice alternative education programs shall be to enable students to perform at grade level.  For purposes of accountability under Chapters [39](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39) and [39A](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39A), a student enrolled in a juvenile justice alternative education program is reported as if the student were enrolled at the student's assigned campus in the student's regularly assigned education program, including a special education program.  Annually the Texas Juvenile Justice Department, with the agreement of the commissioner, shall develop and implement a system of accountability consistent with Chapters [39](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39) and [39A](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39A), where appropriate, to assure that students make progress toward grade level while attending a juvenile justice alternative education program.  The department shall adopt rules for the distribution of funds appropriated under this section to juvenile boards in counties required to establish juvenile justice alternative education programs.  Except as determined by the commissioner, a student served by a juvenile justice alternative education program on the basis of an expulsion required under Section [37.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.007)(a), (d), or (e) is not eligible for Foundation School Program funding under Chapter [31](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=31) or [48](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48) if the juvenile justice alternative education program receives funding from the department under this subchapter.
    
    (i)  A student transferred to a juvenile justice alternative education program must participate in the program for the full period ordered by the juvenile court unless the student's school district agrees to accept the student before the date ordered by the juvenile court.  The juvenile court may not order a period of transfer under this section that exceeds the term of any probation ordered by the juvenile court.
    
    (j)  In relation to the development and operation of a juvenile justice alternative education program, a juvenile board and a county and a commissioners court are immune from liability to the same extent as a school district, and the juvenile board's or county's professional employees and volunteers are immune from liability to the same extent as a school district's professional employees and volunteers.
    
    (k)  Each school district in a county with a population greater than 125,000 and the county juvenile board shall annually enter into a joint memorandum of understanding that:
    
    (1)  outlines the responsibilities of the juvenile board concerning the establishment and operation of a juvenile justice alternative education program under this section;
    
    (2)  defines the amount and conditions on payments from the school district to the juvenile board for students of the school district served in the juvenile justice alternative education program whose placement was not made on the basis of an expulsion required under Section [37.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.007)(a), (d), or (e);
    
    (3)  establishes that a student may be placed in the juvenile justice alternative education program if the student engages in serious misbehavior, as defined by Section [37.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.007)(c);
    
    (4)  identifies and requires a timely placement and specifies a term of placement for expelled students for whom the school district has received a notice under Section [52.041](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&Value=52.041)(d), Family Code;
    
    (5)  establishes services for the transitioning of expelled students to the school district prior to the completion of the student's placement in the juvenile justice alternative education program;
    
    (6)  establishes a plan that provides transportation services for students placed in the juvenile justice alternative education program;
    
    (7)  establishes the circumstances and conditions under which a juvenile may be allowed to remain in the juvenile justice alternative education program setting once the juvenile is no longer under juvenile court jurisdiction; and
    
    (8)  establishes a plan to address special education services required by law.
    
    (l)  The school district shall be responsible for providing an immediate educational program to students who engage in behavior resulting in expulsion under Section [37.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.007)(b) and (f) but who are not eligible for admission into the juvenile justice alternative education program in accordance with the memorandum of understanding required under this section.  The school district may provide the program or the school district may contract with a county juvenile board, a private provider, or one or more other school districts to provide the program.  The memorandum of understanding shall address the circumstances under which such students who continue to engage in serious misbehavior, as defined by Section [37.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.007)(c), shall be admitted into the juvenile justice alternative education program.
    
    (m)  Each school district in a county with a population greater than 125,000 and the county juvenile board shall adopt a joint memorandum of understanding as required by this section not later than September 1 of each school year.
    
    (n)  If a student who is ordered to attend a juvenile justice alternative education program moves from one county to another, the juvenile court may request the juvenile justice alternative education program in the county to which the student moves to provide educational services to the student in accordance with the local memorandum of understanding between the school district and juvenile board in the receiving county.
    
    (o)  In relation to the development and operation of a juvenile justice alternative education program, a juvenile board and a county and a commissioners court are immune from liability to the same extent as a school district, and the juvenile board's or county's employees and volunteers are immune from liability to the same extent as a school district's employees and volunteers.
    
    (p)  If a district elects to contract with the juvenile board for placement in the juvenile justice alternative education program of students expelled under Section [37.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=37.007)(b), (c), and (f) and the juvenile board and district are unable to reach an agreement in the memorandum of understanding, either party may request that the issues of dispute be referred to a binding arbitration process that uses a qualified alternative dispute resolution arbitrator in which each party will pay its pro rata share of the arbitration costs.  Each party must submit its final proposal to the arbitrator.  If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, the juvenile board shall select an arbitrator, the school districts shall select an arbitrator, and those two arbitrators shall select an arbitrator who will decide the issues in dispute.  An arbitration decision issued under this subsection is enforceable in a court in the county in which the juvenile justice alternative education program is located.  Any decision by an arbitrator concerning the amount of the funding for a student who is expelled and attending a juvenile justice alternative education program must provide an amount sufficient based on operation of the juvenile justice alternative education program in accordance with this chapter.  In determining the amount to be paid by a school district for an expelled student enrolled in a juvenile justice alternative education program, the arbitrator shall consider the relevant factors, including evidence of:
    
    (1)  the actual average total per student expenditure in the district's alternative education setting;
    
    (2)  the expected per student cost in the juvenile justice alternative education program as described and agreed on in the memorandum of understanding and in compliance with this chapter;  and
    
    (3)  the costs necessary to achieve the accountability goals under this chapter.
    
    (q)  In accordance with rules adopted by the board of trustees for the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, a certified educator employed by a juvenile board in a juvenile justice alternative education program shall be eligible for membership and participation in the system to the same extent that an employee of a public school district is eligible.  The juvenile board shall make any contribution that otherwise would be the responsibility of the school district if the person were employed by the school district, and the state shall make any contribution to the same extent as if the person were employed by a school district.
