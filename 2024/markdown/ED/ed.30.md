    (c-2)  The scope of any reevaluation by a school district of a student who has been determined, after the full individual and initial evaluation, to be eligible for the district's special education program on the basis of a visual impairment shall be determined, in accordance with 34 C.F.R. Sections 300.122 and 300.303 through 300.311, by a multidisciplinary team that includes, as provided by commissioner rule, a person described by Subsection (c-1)(1)(A).
    
    (d)  In developing, administering, and coordinating the statewide plan, the agency shall encourage the use of all pertinent resources, whether those resources exist in special education programs or in closely related programs operated by other public or private agencies, through encouraging the development of shared services arrangement working relationships and by assisting in the development of contractual arrangements between school districts and other organizations.

    Sec. 30.003.  SUPPORT OF STUDENTS ENROLLED IN TEXAS SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND AND VISUALLY IMPAIRED OR TEXAS SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF.  (a)  For each student enrolled in the Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired or the Texas School for the Deaf, the school district that is responsible for providing appropriate special education services to the student shall share the cost of the student's education as provided by this section.
    
    (b)  If the student is admitted to the school for a full-time program for the equivalent of two long semesters, the district's share of the cost is an amount equal to the dollar amount of maintenance and debt service taxes imposed by the district for that year divided by the district's average daily attendance for the preceding year.
    
    (c)  If the student is admitted for a program less than two complete semesters in duration, other than a summer program, the district's share of the cost is an amount equal to the amount that would be the district's share under Subsection (b) for a full-time program multiplied by the quotient resulting from the number of full-time equivalent days in the program divided by the minimum number of days of instruction for students as provided by Section [25.081](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=25.081).
    
    (d)  Each school district and state institution shall provide to the commissioner the necessary information to determine the district's share under this section.  The information must be reported to the commissioner on or before a date set by rule of the State Board of Education.  After determining the amount of a district's share for all students for which the district is responsible, the commissioner shall deduct that amount from the payments of foundation school funds payable to the district.  Each deduction shall be in the same percentage of the total amount of the district's share as the percentage of the total foundation school fund entitlement being paid to the district at the time of the deduction, except that the amount of any deduction may be modified to make necessary adjustments or to correct errors.  The commissioner shall provide for remitting the amount deducted to the appropriate school at the same time at which the remaining funds are distributed to the district.  If a district does not receive foundation school funds or if a district's foundation school entitlement is less than the amount of the district's share under this section, the commissioner shall direct the district to remit payment to the commissioner, and the commissioner shall remit the district's share to the appropriate school.
    
    (e)  For each student enrolled in the Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired or the Texas School for the Deaf, the appropriate school is entitled to the state available school fund apportionment.
    
    (f)  The commissioner, with the assistance of the comptroller, shall determine the amount that the Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired and the Texas School for the Deaf would have received from the available school fund if Chapter [28](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=28), Acts of the 68th Legislature, 2nd Called Session, 1984, had not transferred statutorily dedicated taxes from the available school fund to the foundation school fund.  That amount, minus any amount the schools do receive from the available school fund, shall be set apart as a separate account in the foundation school fund and appropriated to those schools for educational purposes.
    
    (f-1)  The commissioner shall determine the total amount that the Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired and the Texas School for the Deaf would have received from school districts in accordance with this section if the following provisions had not reduced the districts' share of the cost of providing education services:
    
    (1)  H.B.  No. 1, Acts of the 79th Legislature, 3rd Called Session, 2006;
    
    (2)  Section [45.0032](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=45.0032);

    (f-2)  The amount determined under Subsection (f-1), minus any amount the schools do receive from school districts, shall be set aside as a separate account in the foundation school fund and appropriated to those schools for educational purposes.

    Sec. 30.021.  PURPOSE OF TEXAS SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND AND VISUALLY IMPAIRED.  (a)  The Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired is a state agency established to serve as a special school in the continuum of statewide alternative placements for students who are 21 years of age or younger on September 1 of any school year and who have a visual impairment and who may have one or more other disabilities.  The school is intended to serve students who require specialized or intensive educational or related services related to the visual impairment.  The school is not intended to serve:
    
    (1)  students whose needs are appropriately addressed in a home or hospital setting or in a residential treatment facility;  or
    
    (2)  students whose primary, ongoing needs are related to a severe or profound emotional, behavioral, or cognitive deficit.
    
    (b)  The school district in which a student resides is responsible for assuring that a free appropriate public education is provided to each district student placed in the regular school year program of the school and that all legally required meetings for the purpose of developing and reviewing the student's individualized educational program are conducted.  If the school disagrees with a district's individualized education program committee recommendation that a student be evaluated for placement, initially placed, or continued to be placed at the school, the district or the school may seek resolution according to a procedure established by the commissioner or through any due process hearing to which the district or school is entitled under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. Section 1400 et seq.).
    
    (c)  The school shall conduct supplemental programs, such as summer programs and student exchange programs, and shall consider information from sources throughout the state regarding the nature of those programs and students to be served.
    
    (d)  The school shall provide statewide services to parents of students with visual impairments, school districts, regional education service centers, and other agencies serving students with visual impairments, including students who have one or more disabilities in addition to the visual impairment, such as students who are deaf-blind.  Those services must include:
    
    (1)  developing and providing local, regional, and statewide training for parents of students with visual impairments and professionals who work with persons with visual impairments;
    
    (2)  providing consultation and technical assistance to parents and professionals related to special education and related services for students;
    
    (3)  developing and disseminating reference materials including materials in the areas of curriculum, instructional methodology, and educational technology;
    
    (4)  providing information related to library resources, adapted materials, current research, technology resources, and teaching, assessment, and transition of students with visual impairments;  
    
    (5)  operating programs for lending educational and technological materials to school districts and regional education service centers;  and
    
    (6)  facilitating the preparation of teachers for visually impaired students by providing assistance to colleges and universities as well as other teacher preparation programs.
    
    (e)  The school shall cooperate with public and private agencies and organizations serving students and other persons with visual impairments in the planning, development, and implementation of effective educational and rehabilitative service delivery systems associated with educating students with visual impairments.  To maximize and make efficient use of state facilities, funding, and resources, the services provided in this area may include conducting a cooperative program with other agencies to serve students who have graduated from high school by completing all academic requirements applicable to students in regular education, excluding satisfactory performance under Section [39.025](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39.025), who are younger than 22 years of age on September 1 of the school year and who have identified needs related to vocational training, independent living skills, orientation and mobility, social and leisure skills, compensatory skills, or remedial academic skills.
    
    (f)  The school may operate an on-campus canteen to offer food service at mealtimes and during other times of the day.
    
    (g)  If a school district or another educational entity requests an assessment of a student's educational or related needs related to visual impairment, the school may conduct an assessment and charge a reasonable fee for the assessment.

    Sec. 30.106.  READING AND BEHAVIOR PLAN.  (a)  Because learning and behavior are inextricably linked and learning and improved behavior correlate with decreased recidivism rates, the Texas Juvenile Justice Department shall not only fulfill the department's duties under state and federal law to provide general and special educational services to students in department educational programs but also shall implement a comprehensive plan to improve the reading skills and behavior of those students.
    
    (b)  To improve the reading skills of students in department educational programs, the department shall:
    
    (1)  adopt a reliable battery of reading assessments that:
    
    (A)  are based on a normative sample appropriate to students in department educational programs;
    
    (B)  are designed to be administered on an individual basis; and
    
    (C)  allow school employees to:
    
    (i)  evaluate performance in each essential component of effective reading instruction, including phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension;
    
    (ii)  monitor progress in areas of deficiency specific to an individual student; and
    
    (iii)  provide reading performance data;
    
    (2)  administer the assessments adopted under Subdivision (1):

    (B)  at least 15 days and not more than 30 days before a student is released from the department;
    
    (3)  provide at least 60 minutes per school day of individualized reading instruction to each student in a department educational program who exhibits deficits in reading on the assessments adopted under Subdivision (1):
    
    (A)  by trained educators with expertise in teaching reading to struggling adolescent readers; and
    
    (B)  through the use of scientifically based, peer-reviewed reading curricula that:
    
    (i)  have proven effective in improving the reading performance of struggling adolescent readers;
    
    (ii)  address individualized and differentiated reading goals; and
    
    (iii)  include each of the essential components of effective reading instruction, including phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension;
    
    (4)  require each teacher in a department regular or special educational program who teaches English language arts, reading, mathematics, science, social studies, or career and technology education to be trained in incorporating content area reading instruction using empirically validated instructional methods that are appropriate for struggling adolescent readers; and
    
    (5)  evaluate the effectiveness of the department's plan to increase reading skills according to the following criteria:
    
    (A)  an adequate rate of improvement in reading performance, as measured by monthly progress monitoring using curricular-based assessments in each of the essential components of effective reading instruction, including phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension;
    
    (B)  a significant annual rate of improvement in reading performance, disaggregated by subgroups designated under department rule, as measured using the battery of reading assessments adopted under Subdivision (1); and
    
    (C)  student ratings of the quality and impact of the reading plan under this subsection, as measured on a student self-reporting instrument.
    
    (c)  To increase the positive social behaviors of students in department educational programs and to create an educational environment that facilitates learning, the department shall:
    
    (1)  adopt system-wide classroom and individual positive behavior supports that incorporate a continuum of prevention and intervention strategies that:
    
    (A)  are based on current behavioral research; and
    
    (B)  are systematically and individually applied to students consistent with the demonstrated level of need;
    
    (2)  require each teacher and other educational staff member in a department educational program to be trained in implementing the positive behavior support system adopted under Subdivision (1); and
    
    (3)  adopt valid assessment techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of the positive behavior support system according to the following criteria:
    
    (A)  documentation of school-related disciplinary referrals, disaggregated by the type, location, and time of infraction and by subgroups designated under department rule;
    
    (B)  documentation of school-related disciplinary actions, including time-out, placement in security, and use of restraints and other aversive control measures, disaggregated by subgroups designated under department rule;
    
    (C)  validated measurement of systemic positive behavioral support interventions; and
    
    (D)  the number of minutes students are out of the regular classroom because of disciplinary reasons.
    
    (d)  The department shall consult with faculty from institutions of higher education who have expertise in reading instruction for adolescents, in juvenile corrections, and in positive behavior supports to develop and implement the plan under Subsections (b) and (c).
    
    (e)  A student in a department educational program may not be released on parole from the department unless the student participates, to the extent required by department rule, in the positive behavior support system under Subsection (c).  A student in a department educational program who exhibits deficits in reading on the assessments adopted under Subsection (b)(1) must also participate in reading instruction to the extent required by this section and by department rule before the student may be released on parole.
