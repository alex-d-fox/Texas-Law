    SUBCHAPTER A. GENERAL PROVISIONS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 61.001.  SHORT TITLE.  This chapter may be cited as the Higher Education Coordinating Act of 1965.
    
    
    
    
    Acts 1971, 62nd Leg., p. 3072, ch. 1024, art. 1, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1971.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 61.002.  PURPOSE.  (a)  The purpose of this chapter is to establish in the field of public higher education in the State of Texas an agency to provide leadership and coordination for the Texas higher education system, institutions, and governing boards, to the end that the State of Texas may achieve excellence for college education of its youth through the efficient and effective utilization and concentration of all available resources and the elimination of costly duplication in program offerings, faculties, and physical plants.
    
    (b)  In the exercise of its leadership role, the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board established by this chapter shall be an advocate for the provision of adequate resources and sufficient authority to institutions of higher education so that such institutions may realize, within their prescribed role and scope, their full potential to the benefit of the students who attend such institutions and to the benefit of the citizens of the state in terms of the realization of the benefits of an educated populace.
    
    (c)  Postsecondary education for qualified Texans who desire to pursue such education is important to the welfare and security of this state and the nation and, consequently, is an important public purpose.  The legislature finds and declares that the state can achieve its full economic and social potential only if every individual has the opportunity to contribute to the full extent of the individual's capabilities and only when financial barriers to the individual's economic, social, and educational goals are removed.  In order to facilitate the removal of those barriers, the board, in consultation with one or more nonprofit entities with experience providing the services on a statewide basis, may  provide necessary and desirable services related to financial aid services, including cooperative awareness efforts with appropriate educational and civic associations designed to disseminate postsecondary education awareness information, including information regarding available grant and loan programs and the prevention of student loan default.
    
    (d)  The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board has only the powers expressly provided by law or necessarily implied from an express grant of power.  Any function or power not expressly granted to the board by this code or other law in regard to the administration, organization, control, management, jurisdiction, or governance of an institution of higher education is reserved to and shall be performed by the governing board of the institution, the applicable system administration, or the institution of higher education.

    Sec. 61.035.  COMPLIANCE MONITORING.  (a)  The board, in consultation with affected stakeholders, shall adopt rules to establish an agency-wide, risk-based compliance monitoring function for:
    
    (1)  funds allocated by the board to institutions of higher education, private or independent institutions of higher education, and other entities, including student financial assistance funds, academic support grants, and any other grants, to ensure that those funds are distributed in accordance with applicable law and board rule; and
    
    (2)  data reported by institutions of higher education to the board and used by the board for funding or policymaking decisions, including data used for formula funding allocations, to ensure the data is reported accurately.
    
    (b)  For purposes of this section, student financial assistance includes grants, scholarships, loans, and work-study.
    
    (c)  After considering potential risks and the board's resources, the board shall review a reasonable portion of the total funds allocated by the board and of data reported to the board.  The board shall use various levels of monitoring, according to risk, ranging from checking reported data for errors and inconsistencies to conducting comprehensive audits, including site visits.
    
    (d)  In developing the board's risk-based approach to compliance monitoring under this section, the board shall consider the following factors relating to an institution of higher education or private or independent institution of higher education:
    
    (1)  the amount of student financial assistance or grant funds allocated to the institution by the board;
    
    (2)  whether the institution is required to obtain and submit an independent audit;
    
    (3)  the institution's internal controls;
    
    (4)  the length of time since the institution's last desk review or site visit;
    
    (5)  past misuse of funds or misreported data by the institution;
    
    (6)  in regard to data verification, whether the data reported to the board by the institution is used for determining funding allocations; and
    
    (7)  other factors as considered appropriate by the board.
    
    (e)  The board shall train compliance monitoring staff to ensure that the staff has the ability to monitor both funds compliance and data reporting accuracy.  Program staff in other board divisions who conduct limited monitoring and contract administration shall coordinate with the compliance monitoring function to identify risks and avoid duplication.
    
    (f)  If the board determines through its compliance monitoring function that funds awarded by the board to an institution of higher education or private or independent institution of higher education have been misused or misallocated by the institution, the board shall present its determination to the institution's governing board, or to the institution's chief executive officer if the institution is a private or independent institution of higher education, and provide an opportunity for a response from the institution.  Following the opportunity for response, the board shall report its determination and the institution's response, together with any recommendations, to the institution's governing board or chief executive officer, as applicable, the governor, and the Legislative Budget Board.
    
    (g)  If the board determines through its compliance monitoring function that an institution of higher education has included errors in the institution's data reported for formula funding, the board:
    
    (1)  for a public junior college, may adjust the appropriations made to the college for a fiscal year as necessary to account for the corrected data; and
    
    (2)  for a general academic teaching institution, a medical and dental unit, or a public technical institute, shall calculate a revised appropriation amount for the applicable fiscal year based on the corrected data and report that revised amount to the governor and Legislative Budget Board for consideration as the basis for budget execution or other appropriate action, and to the comptroller.
    
    (h)  In conducting the compliance monitoring function under this section, the board may partner with internal audit offices at institutions of higher education and private or independent institutions of higher education, as institutional resources allow, to examine the institutions' use of funds allocated by, and data reported to, the board.  To avoid duplication of effort and assist the board in identifying risk, an internal auditor at an institution shall notify the board of any audits conducted by the auditor involving funds administered by the board or data reported to the board.  The board by rule may prescribe the timing and format of the notification required by this subsection.  The board by rule shall require a private or independent institution of higher education to provide to the board the institution's external audit involving funds administered by the board.  The private or independent institution of higher education's external audit must comply with the board's rules for auditing those funds.
    
    (i)  The board may seek technical assistance from the state auditor in establishing the compliance monitoring function under this section.  The state auditor may periodically audit the board's compliance monitoring function as the state auditor considers appropriate.
    
    (j)  In this section:
    
    (1)  "Desk review" means an administrative review by the board that is based on information reported by an institution of higher education or private or independent institution of higher education, including supplemental information required by the board for the purposes of compliance monitoring, except that the term does not include information or accompanying notes gathered by the board during a site visit.
    
    (2)  "Site visit" means an announced or unannounced in-person visit by a representative of the board to an institution of higher education or private or independent institution of higher education for the purposes of compliance monitoring.

    Sec. 61.0512.  BOARD APPROVAL OF ACADEMIC PROGRAMS.  (a)  A new degree or certificate program may be added at an institution of higher education only with specific prior approval of the board.  A new degree or certificate program is considered approved if the board has not completed a review under this section and acted to approve or disapprove the proposed program before the first anniversary of the date on which an institution of higher education submits a completed application for approval to the board.  The board may not summarily disapprove a program without completing the review required by this section.  The board shall specify by rule the elements that constitute a completed application and shall make an administrative determination of the completeness of the application not later than the fifth business day after receiving the application.  A request for additional information in support of an application that has been determined administratively complete does not toll the period within which the application is considered approved under this section.
    
    (b)  At the time an institution of higher education begins preliminary planning for a new degree program, the institution must notify the board before the institution may carry out that planning.
    
    (c)  The board shall review each degree or certificate program offered by an institution of higher education at the time the institution requests to implement a new program to ensure that the program:
    
    (1)  is needed by the state and the local community and does not unnecessarily duplicate programs offered by other institutions of higher education or private or independent institutions of higher education;
    
    (2)  has adequate financing from legislative appropriation, funds allocated by the board, or funds from other sources;
    
    (3)  has necessary faculty and other resources to ensure student success; and
    
    (4)  meets academic standards specified by law or prescribed by board rule, including rules adopted by the board for purposes of this section, or workforce standards established by the Texas Workforce Investment Council.
    
    (d)  The board may review the number of degrees or certificates awarded through a degree or certificate program every four years or more frequently, at the board's discretion.
    
    (e)  The board shall review each degree or certificate program offered by an institution of higher education at least every 10 years after a new program is established using the criteria prescribed by Subsection (c).
    
    (f)  The board may not order the consolidation or elimination of any degree or certificate program offered by an institution of higher education but may, based on the board's review under Subsections (d) and (e), recommend such action to an institution's governing board.  If an institution's governing board does not accept recommendations to consolidate or eliminate a degree or certificate program, the university system or, where a system does not exist, the institution, must identify the programs recommended for consolidation or elimination on the next legislative appropriations request submitted by the system or institution.
    
    (g)  An institution of higher education may offer off-campus courses for credit within the state or distance learning courses only with specific prior approval of the board.  An institution must certify to the board that a course offered for credit outside the state meets the board's academic criteria.  An institution shall include the certification in submitting any other reports required by the board.
    
    (h)  In approving a degree or certificate program under this section, the board:
    
    (1)  for a doctoral program, may not consider undergraduate graduation or persistence rates; and

    (A)  shall approve the degree program within 60 days after the date the board receives notice of the degree program if the degree program:
    
    (i)  is approved by the governing board of the junior college district; and
    
    (ii)  is not an engineering program; and
    
    (B)  is considered to have approved the degree program after the date described by Paragraph (A) if the conditions of that paragraph are satisfied.

The board shall apply to an appropriate organization for that purpose.
    
    (b)  The board shall administer an agreement entered into under this section, including by:
    
    (1)  establishing an application and approval process for a degree-granting postsecondary educational institution with its principal campus located in this state to participate under the agreement; and
    
    (2)  maintaining a dispute resolution procedure for complaints regarding participating postsecondary educational institutions located in this state.
    
    (c)  If the board obtains evidence that a public or private postsecondary educational institution established outside this state that is providing courses within this state under a state authorization reciprocity agreement established under this section is in apparent violation of the agreement or of this code or rules adopted under this section, the board shall take appropriate action to terminate the institution's operation within this state.

    (b)  As soon as practicable after an institution of higher education completes preliminary planning for a new doctor of medicine (M.D.) or doctor of osteopathic medicine (D.O.) degree program, the institution promptly shall provide to the board a specific plan regarding the addition of first-year residency positions for the graduate medical education program to be offered in connection with the degree program.  The plan must propose an increase in the number of those first-year residency positions that, when combined with the total number of existing first-year residency positions in this state, will be sufficient to reasonably accommodate the number of anticipated graduates from all doctor of medicine (M.D.) or doctor of osteopathic medicine (D.O.) degree programs that are offered in this state, including the degree program proposed by the institution, and to provide adequate opportunity for those graduates to remain in this state for the clinical portion of their education.
    
    (b-1)  If in its preliminary planning the institution establishes a long-term targeted maximum individual enrollment class size that differs from its proposed initial maximum individual enrollment class size, the institution's plan under Subsection (b) must include a proposed increase in the number of first-year residency positions over time that will be sufficient to accommodate, in accordance with the requirements of that subsection, the institution's planned increase or increases in maximum individual enrollment class size.
    
    (c)  Submission of a plan described by this section is a prerequisite for the board's approval of the proposed degree program.
    
    (d)  An institution's projected increase in first-year residency positions is presumed to be sufficient in its plan if, considering both the institution's proposed initial maximum individual enrollment class size and any projected growth in that class size, the increase will achieve the purposes of this section with respect to all graduates from degree programs described by this section that are offered or will be offered by the institution.
    
    (d-1)  Any institution that experiences substantial growth in an individual enrollment class size after the approval of its plan promptly shall provide to the board an updated plan that complies with Subsection (b) based on the institution's actual maximum individual enrollment class size and, if the institution anticipates continued substantial growth, based on the institution's targeted maximum individual enrollment class size.  The board shall adopt rules that clearly define what constitutes a substantial growth in class size for an institution subject to this section.
    
    (e)  The institution may consult with the board as necessary to develop the plan required by this section.

    (b)  The board may review all construction, repair, or rehabilitation of buildings and facilities at institutions of higher education to determine whether the construction, rehabilitation, or repair meets the standards adopted by board rule for cost, efficiency, space need, and space use, but the construction, rehabilitation, or repair is not contingent on board review.  Standards must be adopted by the board using the negotiated rulemaking procedures under Chapter [2008](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2008), Government Code.  If the construction, rehabilitation, or repair does not meet those standards, the board shall notify the governor, the lieutenant governor, the speaker of the house of representatives, the governing boards of the applicable institutions, and the Legislative Budget Board.  This subsection does not impair the board's authority to collect data relating to the construction, repair, or rehabilitation of buildings and facilities occurring each year at institutions of higher education.

    (1)  allocate resources efficiently and provide incentives for programs of superior quality and for institutional diversity;
    
    (2)  provide incentives for supporting the five-year master plan developed and revised under Section [61.051](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=61.051);

The board shall furnish any other assistance to the governor and the Legislative Budget Board in the development of appropriations recommendations as either or both of them may request.  However, nothing in this chapter shall prevent or prohibit the governor, the Legislative Budget Board, the board, or the governing board of any institution of higher education from requesting or recommending deviations from any applicable formula or formulas prescribed by the board and advancing reasons and arguments in support of them.
    
    (e)  The board shall present to the governor and to each legislature a comprehensive summary and analysis of institutional appropriation requests, and for that purpose each institution's request must be submitted to the board at the same time at which the request is submitted to the Legislative Budget Board.

    (g)  The board shall recommend to the institutions, the governor, and the Legislative Budget Board tuition policies for public technical institutes, public junior colleges, public senior colleges and universities, medical and dental units, and other agencies of higher education and vocational and technical programs receiving support from state funds.
    
    (h)  The board shall distribute funds appropriated to the board for allocation for specified purposes under limitations prescribed by law and the rules and regulations of the board in conformity therewith, provided that no distribution or allocation may be made to any institution of higher education which has failed or refused to comply with any order of the board as long as that failure or refusal continues.

    (c)  The board by rule shall establish a registration fee to be paid by training program participants in an amount adequate to cover the costs incurred by the board and other state agencies in providing the training program.  A participant shall pay from private funds the fee required by this subsection and the participant's costs of travel, including transportation, lodging, and meals.

    (10)  any other topic relating to higher education the board considers important.
    
    (e)  In addition to the content of the instruction at a training program required under Subsection (d), topics covered by the training program for members of a governing board of a public junior college district must include information about best practices in campus financial management, financial ratio analysis, and case studies using financial indicators.

    Sec. 61.301.  PURPOSE.  It is the policy and purpose of the State of Texas to prevent deception of the public resulting from the conferring and use of fraudulent or substandard college and university degrees;  it is also the purpose of this subchapter to regulate the use of academic terminology in naming or otherwise designating educational institutions, the advertising, solicitation or representation by educational institutions or their agents, and the maintenance and preservation of essential academic records.  Because degrees and equivalent indicators of educational attainment are used by employers in judging the training of prospective employees, by public and private professional groups in determining qualifications for admission to and continuance of practice, and by the general public in assessing the competence of persons engaged in a wide range of activities necessary to the general welfare, regulation by law of the evidences of college and university educational attainment is in the public interest.  To the same end the protection of legitimate institutions and of those holding degrees from them is also in the public interest.

    Sec. 61.303.  EXEMPTIONS.  (a)  Unless specifically provided otherwise, the provisions of this subchapter do not apply to an institution that is fully accredited by, and is not operating under sanctions imposed by, a recognized accrediting agency, or an institution or degree program that has received approval by a state agency authorizing the institution's graduates to take a professional or vocational state licensing examination administered by that agency.  The granting of permission by a state agency to a graduate of an institution to take a licensing examination does not by itself constitute approval of the institution or degree program required for an exemption under this subsection.
    
    (b)  The exemptions provided by Subsection (a) apply only to the degree level for which an institution is accredited, and if an institution offers to award a degree at a level for which it is not accredited, the exemption does not apply.
    
    (c)  Except as provided by Subsection (c-1), the board may approve the issuance of a certificate of authorization to grant degrees to an exempt institution or person.  The board may adopt rules regarding a process to allow an exempt institution or person to apply and receive approval for a certificate of authorization under this section.
    
    (c-1)  The board may not approve the issuance of a certificate of authorization for an exempt institution to grant a professional degree or to represent that credits earned in this state are applicable toward a professional degree except to the extent allowed for an authorized institution operating under a State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (SARA).

    (d)  The board by rule may require an exempt institution or person to ensure that the financial resources and financial stability of the institution or person are adequate to provide education of a good quality and to fulfill the institution's or person's commitments to its enrolled students and may require the institution or person to provide to the board documentation of the institution's or person's compliance with those requirements.  Rules adopted under this subsection must:
    
    (1)  require the institution or person to maintain reserves, lines of credit, or surety instruments that, when combined with tuition and fee receipts, are sufficient to allow the institution or person to fulfill its educational obligations to its enrolled students if the institution or person is unable to continue to provide instruction to its enrolled students for any reason; and
    
    (2)  require that the financial resources maintained under Subdivision (1) be conditioned to allow only the board to withdraw funds for the benefit of the institution's or person's enrolled students under the circumstance described by Subdivision (1).
    
    (e)  To enable the board to verify the conditions under which a certificate of authorization issued under this section is held, the board by rule may require an exempt institution or person to report to the board on a continuing basis other appropriate information in addition to the documentation required under Subsection (d).
    
    (f)  An exempt institution or person continues in that status only if the institution or person maintains accreditation by, and is not operating under sanctions imposed by, a recognized accrediting agency or otherwise meets the provisions of Subsection (a).
    
    (g)  The board by rule shall provide for due process and shall provide procedures for revoking or placing conditions on the exemption status of an institution or person or for revoking or placing conditions on a previously issued certificate of authorization.
    
    (h)  Under the rules described by Subsection (g), the board may revoke or place conditions on an institution's or person's exemption status or certificate of authorization only if the board has reasonable cause to believe that the institution or person has violated this subchapter or any rule adopted under this subchapter.
    
    (i)  Before revoking or placing conditions on an institution's or person's exemption status or certificate of authorization under Subsection (h), the board must provide to the institution or person written notice of the board's impending action and include the grounds for that action.
    
    (j)  If the board places conditions on an institution's or person's exemption status or certificate of authorization under Subsection (h), until the board removes the conditions, the board may reexamine the applicable institution or person at least twice annually following the date the board provided notice under Subsection (i).
    
    (k)  A private postsecondary educational institution may not establish or operate a branch campus, extension center, or other off-campus unit in Texas except as provided by this subsection or the rules of the board.  This subsection does not apply to a private or independent institution of higher education as defined by Section [61.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=61.003).

(a)  The board, with the assistance of advisory committees composed of representatives of institutions of higher education, shall develop field of study curricula.  Each advisory committee shall be equitably composed of representatives of institutions of higher education.  Each university system or institution of higher education which offers a degree program for which a field of study curriculum is proposed shall be offered participation on the advisory committee for that particular field of study.  At least a majority of the members of any advisory committee named under this section shall be faculty members of an institution of higher education.  An institution shall consult with the faculty of the institution before nominating or recommending a person to the board as the institution's representative on an advisory committee.
    
    (a-1)  The board by rule may authorize a general academic teaching institution to adopt, for each field of study curriculum developed by the board for which the institution offers a degree program, a set of courses specific to that field of study, for a total of at least six semester credit hours or the equivalent, that must be completed as part of the field of study curriculum for that institution.  Each general academic teaching institution that adopts a set of courses for a field of study curriculum under this subsection shall post on the institution's Internet website in a manner easily accessible to students the set of courses with the associated course numbers under the common course numbering system.
    
    (b)  If a student successfully completes a field of study curriculum developed by the board, that block of courses may be transferred to a general academic teaching institution and, subject to completion of the set of courses adopted by the institution for that field of study under Subsection (a-1), must be substituted for that institution's lower division requirements for the degree program for the field of study into which the student transfers, and the student shall receive full academic credit toward the degree program for the block of courses transferred.
    
    (c)  A student who transfers from one institution of higher education to another without completing the field of study curriculum of the sending institution shall receive academic credit from the receiving institution for each of the courses that the student has successfully completed in the field of study curriculum of the sending institution.  Following receipt of credit for these courses, the student may be required to satisfy further course requirements in the field of study curriculum of the receiving institution.
    
    (d)  In developing field of study curricula, the board shall pursue a management strategy that maximizes efficiency, including a management strategy that provides for the decentralization of advisory committees to enable concurrent development of curricula for different fields of study.
    
    (e)  The board, with the assistance of an appropriate advisory committee, shall periodically review each field of study curriculum to ensure alignment with student interest and academic and industry needs.

    (2)  each nursing education program participating in the partnership will, as a result of the partnership, enroll in the nursing education program a sufficient number of additional students as established by the board;
    
    (3)  the marginal cost to the state of producing a graduate of a nursing education program participating in the partnership will be comparable, as determined under criteria established by board rule, to the marginal cost to the state of producing a graduate of a nursing education program not  participating in a partnership;
    
    (4)  each hospital participating in a partnership with a nursing education program will provide to students enrolled in the program clinical placements that:
    
    (A)  allow the students to take part in providing or to observe, as appropriate, medical services offered by the hospital; and
    
    (B)  meet the clinical education needs of the students; and

    (1)  use the money to make grants to other hospital-based nursing education partnerships;
    
    (2)  use the money to make grants under the professional nursing shortage reduction program established under Subchapter Z; or
