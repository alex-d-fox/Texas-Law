    (11)  allows physical education classes to be an enjoyable experience for students.
    
    (e)  American Sign Language is a language for purposes of Subsection (a)(2)(A).  A public school may offer an elective course in the language.

The agency shall make available information provided under this subsection to other districts.
    
    (g-3)  A district may also offer a course in cybersecurity that is approved by the board of trustees for credit without obtaining State Board of Education approval if the district partners with a public or private institution of higher education that offers an undergraduate degree program in cybersecurity to develop and provide the course.

    (a-8)  A school district may not be required to provide supplemental instruction under Subsection (a-1)(2) to a student in more than two subject areas per school year. If the district would otherwise be required to provide supplemental instruction to a student in more than two subject areas for a school year, the district shall prioritize providing supplemental instruction to the student in mathematics and reading, or Algebra I, English I, or English II, as applicable, for that school year.
    
    (a-9)  A parent or guardian of a student to whom supplemental instruction will be provided under Subsection (a-1)(2) and who either was administered and failed to perform satisfactorily on an assessment instrument specified under Subsection (a-1) or was administered a beginning-of-year assessment instrument aligned with the essential knowledge and skills for the applicable subject area, including a student to whom Subsection (b) applies, may elect to modify or remove a requirement for that instruction under Subsection (a-4) by submitting a written request to an administrator of the campus at which the student is enrolled.  A school district may not encourage or direct a parent or guardian to make an election under this subsection that would allow the district to:
    
    (1)  not provide supplemental instruction to the student; or
    
    (2)  provide supplemental instruction in a group larger than authorized under Subsection (a-4)(6).
    
    (a-10)  A school district is not required to provide accelerated instruction under Subsection (a-1) to a student who, instead of being administered an assessment instrument specified under Subsection (a-1), was administered a substitute assessment instrument in accordance with other law or agency rule authorizing the use of the substitute assessment instrument for purposes of satisfying the requirements concerning the applicable assessment instrument under Subsection (a-1).
    
    (a-11)  The agency shall approve one or more products that use an automated, computerized, or other augmented method for providing supplemental instruction under Subsection (a-1)(2) that may be used in lieu of some or all of the individual or group instruction required under Subsection (a-4)(6), as appropriate for the applicable grade level and subject area and a student's academic deficiency.  The agency may approve a product under this subsection only if evidence indicates that the product is more effective than the individual or group instruction required under Subsection (a-4)(6).  The commissioner shall adopt rules regarding when a product approved under this subsection may be used and the requirements under Subsection (a-4) for which the product may be substituted.
    
    (a-12)  For the purpose of providing accelerated instruction or supplemental instruction under this section, a school district may use a service provider that is not on a list of service providers approved by the agency if the district can demonstrate to the commissioner that use of the service provider results in measurable improvement in student outcomes.
    
    (a-13)  A school district that is required to provide to a student accelerated instruction under Subsection (a-1) or supplemental instruction under Subsection (a-1)(2) is not required to provide additional instruction under either provision to the student based on the student's failure to perform satisfactorily on an assessment instrument administered as an optional assessment in the same subject area in which the district is required to provide the student the accelerated or supplemental instruction.
    
    (a-14)  A school district shall provide to the parent or guardian of a student who fails to perform satisfactorily on an assessment instrument specified under Subsection (a-1) notice that the student is not performing on grade level in the applicable subject area.  Notwithstanding Subsection (h), the district must provide the notice at a parent-teacher conference or, if the district is unable to provide the notice at a parent-teacher conference, by another means.  The agency shall develop and provide to school districts a model notice in plain language for use under this section.
    
    (b)  For each student who does not perform satisfactorily on an assessment instrument specified under Subsection (a-1) for two or more consecutive school years in the same subject area, the school district the student attends shall develop an accelerated education plan as described by Subsection (f).
    
    (b-1)  A school district shall make a good faith attempt to provide to the parent or guardian of a student to whom Subsection (b) applies a parent-teacher conference with the student's primary teacher at the start and end of the subsequent school year.  At the conference, the district shall provide the student's parent or guardian with:
    
    (1)  the notice required under Subsection (a-14); and
    
    (2)  an explanation of:
    
    (A)  the accelerated instruction to which the student is entitled under this section; and
    
    (B)  the accelerated education plan that must be developed for the student under Subsection (f) and the manner in which the parent or guardian may participate in developing the plan.

    (i-1)  If a student who attends school in a homebound or other off-campus instructional arrangement, including at a residential treatment campus or state hospital, is unable to participate in an accelerated instruction program required under this section due to the student's condition, the school district may determine that the student be provided the accelerated instruction when the student attends school in an on-campus instructional setting.
