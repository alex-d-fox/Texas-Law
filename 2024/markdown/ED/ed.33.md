    SUBCHAPTER D. EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 33.081.  EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES.  (a)  The State Board of Education by rule shall limit participation in and practice for extracurricular activities during the school day and the school week.  The rules must, to the extent possible, preserve the school day for academic activities without interruption for extracurricular activities.  In scheduling those activities and practices, a school district must comply with the rules of the board.
    
    (b)  A student enrolled in a school district in this state or who participates in an extracurricular activity or a University Interscholastic League competition is subject to school district policy and University Interscholastic League rules regarding participation only when the student is under the direct supervision of an employee of the school or district in which the student is enrolled or at any other time specified by resolution of the board of trustees of the district.
    
    (c)  A student who is enrolled in a school district in this state or who participates in a University Interscholastic League competition shall be suspended from participation in any extracurricular activity sponsored or sanctioned by the school district or the University Interscholastic League after a grade evaluation period in which the student received a grade lower than the equivalent of 70 on a scale of 100 in any academic class other than a course described by Subsection (d-1).  A suspension continues for at least three school weeks and is not removed during the school year until the conditions of Subsection (d) are met.  A suspension does not last beyond the end of a school year.  For purposes of this subsection, "grade evaluation period" means:
    
    (1)  the six-week grade reporting period; or
    
    (2)  the first six weeks of a semester and each grade reporting period thereafter, in the case of a district with a grade reporting period longer than six weeks.
    
    (d)  Until the suspension is removed under this subsection or the school year ends, a school district shall review the grades of a student suspended under Subsection (c) at the end of each three-week period following the date on which the suspension began.  At the time of a review, the suspension is removed if the student's grade in each class, other than a course described by Subsection (d-1), is equal to or greater than the equivalent of 70 on a scale of 100.  The principal and each of the student's teachers shall make the determination concerning the student's grades.
    
    (d-1)  Subsections (c) and (d) do not apply to an advanced placement or international baccalaureate course, or to an honors or dual credit course in the subject areas of English language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, economics, or a language other than English.  The agency shall review on a biennial basis courses described by this subsection to determine if other courses should be excluded from the requirement that a student be suspended from participation in an extracurricular activity under Subsection (c).  Not later than January 1 of each odd-numbered year, the agency shall report the findings under this subsection to the legislature.
    
    (e)  Suspension of a student with a disability that significantly interferes with the student's ability to meet regular academic standards must be based on the student's failure to meet the requirements of the student's individualized education program.  The determination of whether a disability significantly interferes with a student's ability to meet regular academic standards must be made by the student's admission, review, and dismissal committee.  For purposes of this subsection, "student with a disability" means a student who is eligible for a district's special education program under Section [29.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=29.003)(b).
    
    (e-1)  A student who is enrolled in a school district in this state or who participates in a University Interscholastic League competition shall be prohibited from participation in any future extracurricular activity sponsored or sanctioned by the school district or the University Interscholastic League if the state executive committee of the league determines that the student intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes bodily injury to a person serving as referee, judge, or other official of an extracurricular activity in retaliation for or as a result of the person's actions taken in performing the duties of a referee, judge, or other official of the extracurricular activity.
    
    (e-2)  A student prohibited from participation in an extracurricular activity under Subsection (e-1) may submit to the University Interscholastic League a request that the student be permitted to participate in future extracurricular activities sponsored or sanctioned by the University Interscholastic League if:
    
    (1)  the request is submitted at least:
    
    (A)  one year after the date the student engaged in the conduct that resulted in the prohibition under Subsection (e-1) if the student was enrolled in eighth grade or below at the time of the conduct; or
    
    (B)  two years after the date the student engaged in the conduct that resulted in the prohibition under Subsection (e-1) if the student was enrolled in ninth grade or above at the time of the conduct;
    
    (2)  the student:
    
    (A)  completed a course in anger management since engaging in the conduct that resulted in the prohibition under Subsection (e-1);
    
    (B)  completed any other course, activity, or action required by the school district in which the student is enrolled as a result of the conduct that resulted in the prohibition under Subsection (e-1); and
    
    (C)  demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the school district and the University Interscholastic League, that the student has been rehabilitated and is unlikely to again engage in the conduct described by Subsection (e-1); and
    
    (3)  a previous request submitted by the student under this section has not been denied during the school year in which the request is submitted.
    
    (e-3)  When determining whether to grant a request under Subsection (e-2), the University Interscholastic League:
    
    (1)  shall take into account the severity of the conduct that resulted in the prohibition under Subsection (e-1); and
    
    (2)  may set conditions for the student's future participation in extracurricular activities.
    
    (e-4)  The University Interscholastic League may prohibit a student from participating in any future extracurricular activity sponsored or sanctioned by the University Interscholastic League if the student violates a condition set by the University Interscholastic League under Subsection (e-3)(2).
    
    (f)  Except for a student prohibited from participation under Subsection (e-1), a student suspended under this section may practice or rehearse with other students for an extracurricular activity but may not participate in a competition or other public performance.
    
    (f-1)  A school district shall prohibit a spectator of an extracurricular athletic activity or competition, including a parent or guardian of a student participant, from attending any future extracurricular athletic activity or competition sponsored or sanctioned by the school district or the University Interscholastic League if the spectator engages in conduct that intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes bodily injury to a person serving as referee, judge, or other official of an extracurricular athletic activity or competition in retaliation for or as a result of the person's actions taken in performing the duties of a referee, judge, or other official of the extracurricular athletic activity or competition.
    
    (f-2)  A school district may establish an appeals process by which:
    
    (1)  a person may appeal to the district a prohibition imposed under Subsection (f-1); and
    
    (2)  the district may determine the facts associated with the conduct for which the school district imposed a prohibition under Subsection (f-1).
    
    (f-3)  A prohibition imposed under Subsection (f-1) must be for not less than one year after the date on which the prohibition is imposed but may not exceed five years from the date on which the prohibition is imposed.
    
    (g)  An appeal to the commissioner is not a contested case under Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code, if the issues presented relate to a person's eligibility to participate in or attend an extracurricular activity, including issues related to a student's grades, the school district's grading policy as applied to a student's eligibility, a student's eligibility based on conduct described by Subsection (e-1), or a spectator's eligibility to attend an extracurricular athletic activity or competition under Subsection (f-1).  The commissioner may delegate the matter for decision to a person the commissioner designates.  The decision of the commissioner or the commissioner's designee in a matter governed by this subsection may not be appealed except on the grounds that the decision is arbitrary or capricious.  Evidence may not be introduced on appeal other than the record of the evidence before the commissioner.
    
    (h)  A request made under Subsection (e-2) is not a contested case subject to Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code.

    Sec. 33.0832.  EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR CERTAIN STUDENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN UNIVERSITY INTERSCHOLASTIC LEAGUE ACTIVITIES.  (a)  In this section:
    
    (1)  "League" means the University Interscholastic League.
    
    (2)  "Non-enrolled student" means a student who receives instruction as described by Section [29.916](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=29.916)(a)(1) from a nonpublic school.
    
    (b)  Nothing in this section may be construed to affect the holding in Texas Educ. Agency v. Leeper, 893 S.W.2d 432 (Tex. 1994), classifying home schools as private schools.  The legislature finds that a home school is a private school for purposes of this section.
    
    (c)  Except as provided by Subsection (i), a public school that participates in an activity sponsored by the league may provide a non-enrolled student, who otherwise meets league eligibility standards to represent that school in a league activity, with the opportunity to participate in the activity on behalf of the school in the same manner that the school provides the opportunity to participate to students enrolled in the school.
    
    (c-1)  When assigning league classification to a public school  based on student enrollment, the league must use the same student enrollment calculation formula for a school that allows a non-enrolled student to participate in a league activity as provided by Subsection (c) as the formula used to determine the student enrollment of a school that does not allow a non-enrolled student to participate in the league activity.
    
    (d)  A non-enrolled student who seeks to participate or participates in a league activity on behalf of a school is subject to the following relevant policies that apply to students enrolled in the school:
    
    (1)  registration for league activities;
    
    (2)  age eligibility;
    
    (3)  fees;
    
    (4)  insurance;
    
    (5)  transportation;
    
    (6)  physical condition;
    
    (7)  qualifications;
    
    (8)  responsibilities;
    
    (9)  event schedules;
    
    (10)  standards of behavior; and
    
    (11)  performance.
    
    (e)  A non-enrolled student may only participate in a league activity for the school in the school district that the student would be eligible to attend based on the student's residential address.  A non-enrolled student who seeks to participate in a league activity on behalf of a school shall be required to establish minimum proof of residency acceptable to the district in the same manner as an applicant to attend a school in the district under Section [25.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=25.001).
    
    (f)  The parent or person standing in parental relation to a non-enrolled student is responsible for oversight of academic standards relating to the student's participation in a league activity.  As a condition of eligibility to participate in a league activity during the first six weeks of a school year, a non-enrolled student must demonstrate grade-level academic proficiency on any nationally recognized, norm-referenced assessment instrument, such as the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, Stanford Achievement Test, California Achievement Test, or Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills.  A non-enrolled student demonstrates the required academic proficiency by achieving a composite, core, or survey score that is within the average or higher than average range of scores, as established by the applicable testing service.  For purposes of this subsection, a school district shall accept assessment results administered or reported by a third party.
    
    (g)  A non-enrolled student's demonstration of academic proficiency under Subsection (f) is sufficient for purposes of that subsection for the school year in which the student achieves the required score and the subsequent school year.
    
    (h)  After the first six weeks of a school year, the parent or person standing in parental relation to a non-enrolled student participating in a league activity on behalf of a public school must periodically, in accordance with the school's grading calendar, provide written verification to the school indicating that the student is receiving a passing grade in each course or subject being taught.
    
    (i)  A non-enrolled student is not authorized by this section to participate in a league activity during the remainder of any school year during which the student was previously enrolled in a public school.
    
    (j)  The league may not prohibit a non-enrolled student from participating in league activities in the manner authorized by this section.
    
    (k)  With respect to a non-enrolled student's education program, nothing in this section shall be construed to permit an agency of this state, a public school district, or any other governmental body to exercise control, regulatory authority, or supervision over a non-enrolled student or a parent or person standing in parental relation to a non-enrolled student beyond the control, regulatory authority, or supervision required to participate in a league activity.
    
    (l)  Subject only to eligibility requirements under this section for a non-enrolled student to participate in a league activity:
    
    (1)  the curriculum or assessment requirements, performance standards, practices, or creed of the education program provided to a non-enrolled student may not be required to be changed in order for the non-enrolled student to participate in a league activity; and
    
    (2)  for a non-enrolled student participating in an education program on January 1, 2021, the education program provided to that student may not be required to comply with any state law or agency rule relating to that education program unless the law or rule was in effect on January 1, 2021.
    
    (m)  Notwithstanding any other law, a non-enrolled student who participates in a league activity under this section is subject to the immunization requirements and exceptions of Section [38.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=38.001) in the same manner as a public school student.

    (1)  the student's official birth certificate, as described by Subsection (c); or
    
    (2)  if the student's official birth certificate described by Subdivision (1) is unobtainable, another government record.
    
    (b)  An interscholastic athletic team described by Subsection (a) may allow a female student to compete in an interscholastic athletic competition that is designated for male students if a corresponding interscholastic athletic competition designated for female students is not offered or available.

    (2)  modified to correct any type of scrivener or clerical error in the student's biological sex.

    (2)  "Sports official" means a person who officiates, judges, or in any manner enforces contest rules in any official capacity with respect to and during the course of an interscholastic athletic team competition and who is a member of a league-recognized local chapter or association of sports officials.
