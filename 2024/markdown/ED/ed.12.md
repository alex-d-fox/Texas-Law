    SUBCHAPTER D. OPEN-ENROLLMENT CHARTER SCHOOL
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 12.101.  AUTHORIZATION.  (a)  In accordance with this subchapter, the commissioner may grant a charter on the application of an eligible entity for an open-enrollment charter school to operate in a facility of a commercial or nonprofit entity, an eligible entity, or a school district, including a home-rule school district.  In this subsection, "eligible entity" means:
    
    (1)  an institution of higher education as defined under Section [61.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=61.003);
    
    (2)  a private or independent institution of higher education as defined under Section [61.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=61.003);
    
    (3)  an organization that is exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(3), Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. Section 501(c)(3)); or
    
    (4)  a governmental entity.
    
    (b)  After thoroughly investigating and evaluating an applicant, the commissioner, in coordination with a member of the State Board of Education designated for the purpose by the chair of the board, may grant a charter for an open-enrollment charter school only to an applicant that meets any financial, governing, educational, and operational standards adopted by the commissioner under this subchapter, that the commissioner determines is capable of carrying out the responsibilities provided by the charter and likely to operate a school of high quality, and that:
    
    (1)  has not within the preceding 10 years had a charter under this chapter or a similar charter issued under the laws of another state surrendered under a settlement agreement, revoked, denied renewal, or returned; or
    
    (2)  is not, under rules adopted by the commissioner, considered to be a corporate affiliate of or substantially related to an entity that has within the preceding 10 years had a charter under this chapter or a similar charter issued under the laws of another state surrendered under a settlement agreement, revoked, denied renewal, or returned.
    
    (b-0)  The commissioner shall notify the State Board of Education of each charter the commissioner proposes to grant under this subchapter.  Unless, before the 90th day after the date on which the board receives the notice from the commissioner, a majority of the members of the board present and voting vote against the grant of that charter, the commissioner's proposal to grant the charter takes effect.  The board may not deliberate or vote on any grant of a charter that is not proposed by the commissioner.
    
    (b-1)  In granting charters for open-enrollment charter schools, the commissioner may not grant a total of more than:
    
    (1)  215 charters through the fiscal year ending August 31, 2014;
    
    (2)  225 charters beginning September 1, 2014;
    
    (3)  240 charters beginning September 1, 2015;
    
    (4)  255 charters beginning September 1, 2016;
    
    (5)  270 charters beginning September 1, 2017; and
    
    (6)  285 charters beginning September 1, 2018.
    
    (b-2)  Beginning September 1, 2019, the total number of charters for open-enrollment charter schools that may be granted is 305 charters.
    
    (b-3)  The commissioner may not grant more than one charter for an open-enrollment charter school to any charter holder.  The commissioner may consolidate charters for an open-enrollment charter school held by multiple charter holders into a single charter held by a single charter holder with the written consent to the terms of consolidation by or at the request of each charter holder affected by the consolidation.
    
    (b-4)  Notwithstanding Section [12.114](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=12.114), approval of the commissioner under that section is not required for establishment of a new open-enrollment charter school campus if the requirements of this subsection are satisfied.  A charter holder having an accreditation status of accredited and at least 50 percent of its student population in grades assessed under Subchapter [B](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39.021), Chapter [39](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39), or at least 50 percent of the students in the grades assessed having been enrolled in the school for at least three school years may establish one or more new campuses under an existing charter held by the charter holder if:
    
    (1)  the charter holder is currently evaluated under the standard accountability procedures for evaluation under Chapter [39](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39) and received a district rating in the highest or second highest performance rating category under Subchapter [C](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39.051), Chapter [39](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39), for three of the last five years with at least 75 percent of the campuses rated under the charter also receiving a rating in the highest or second highest performance rating category and with no campus with a rating in the lowest performance rating category in the most recent ratings;
    
    (2)  the charter holder provides written notice to the commissioner of the establishment of any campus under this subsection in the time, manner, and form provided by rule of the commissioner; and
    
    (3)  not later than the 60th day after the date the charter holder provides written notice under Subdivision (2), the commissioner does not provide written notice to the charter holder that the commissioner has determined that the charter holder does not satisfy the requirements of this section.
    
    (b-5)  The initial term of a charter granted under this section is five years.
    
    (b-6)  The commissioner shall adopt rules to modify criteria for granting a charter for an open-enrollment charter school under this section to the extent necessary to address changes in performance rating categories or in the financial accountability system under Chapter [39](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39).
    
    (b-7)  A charter granted under this section for a dropout recovery school is not considered for purposes of the limit on the number of charters for open-enrollment charter schools imposed by this section.  For purposes of this subsection, an open-enrollment charter school is considered to be a dropout recovery school if the school meets the criteria for designation as a dropout recovery school under Section [12.1141](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=12.1141)(c).
    
    (b-8)  In adopting any financial standards under this subchapter that an applicant for a charter for an open-enrollment charter school must meet, the commissioner shall not:
    
    (1)  exclude any loan or line of credit in determining an applicant's available funding; or
    
    (2)  exclude an applicant from the grant of a charter solely because the applicant fails to demonstrate having a certain amount of current assets in cash.
    
    (b-10)  The commissioner by rule shall allow a charter holder to provide written notice of the establishment of a new open-enrollment charter school campus under Subsection (b-4)(2) up to 36 months before the date on which the campus is anticipated to open. Notice provided to the commissioner under this section does not obligate the charter holder to open a new campus.
    
    (c)  If the facility to be used for an open-enrollment charter school is a school district facility, the school must be operated in the facility in accordance with the terms established by the board of trustees or other governing body of the district in an agreement governing the relationship between the school and the district.
    
    (d)  An educator employed by a school district before the effective date of a charter for an open-enrollment charter school operated at a school district facility may not be transferred to or employed by the open-enrollment charter school over the educator's objection.

    (1)  a local government for purposes of Chapter [791](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=791), Government Code;
    
    (2)  a local government for purposes of Chapter [2259](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2259), Government Code, except that an open-enrollment charter school may not issue public securities as provided by Section [2259.031](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2259.031)(b), Government Code;
    
    (3)  a political subdivision for purposes of Chapter [172](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=172), Local Government Code;

An open-enrollment charter school that elects to extend workers' compensation benefits as permitted under this subsection is considered to be a political subdivision for all purposes under Chapter [504](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=504), Labor Code.  An open-enrollment charter school that self-insures either individually or collectively under Chapter [504](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LA&Value=504), Labor Code, is considered to be an insurance carrier for purposes of Subtitle A, Title 5, Labor Code.
    
    (c)  Notwithstanding Subsection (a) or (b), an open-enrollment charter school operated by a tax exempt entity as described by Section [12.101](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=12.101)(a)(3) is not considered to be a political subdivision, local government, or local governmental entity unless:
    
    (1)  a statute specifically states that the statute applies to an open-enrollment charter school; or
    
    (2)  a provision in this chapter states that a specific statute applies to an open-enrollment charter school.
    
    (d)  A political subdivision shall consider an open-enrollment charter school a school district for purposes of zoning, project permitting, platting and replatting processes, business licensing, franchises, utility services, signage, subdivision regulation, property development projects, the requirements for posting bonds or securities, contract requirements, land development standards as provided by Section [212.902](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=LG&Value=212.902), Local Government Code, tree and vegetation regulations, regulations of architectural features of a structure, construction of fences, landscaping, garbage disposal, noise levels, fees or other assessments, and construction or site development work if the charter school provides to the political subdivision the certification described by Subsection (e).
    
    (e)  To be considered a school district by a political subdivision in accordance with Subsection (d), the governing body of an open-enrollment charter school must certify in writing to the political subdivision that no administrator, officer, or employee of the charter school and no member of the governing body of the charter school or its charter holder derives any personal financial benefit from a real estate transaction with the charter school.
    
    (f)  An open-enrollment charter school considered a school district under this section shall comply with the same requirements imposed by the political subdivision on a campus of a school district.
    
    (g)  An open-enrollment charter school does not have the power of eminent domain.

    (i)  A political subdivision may not take any action that prohibits an open-enrollment charter school from operating a public school campus, educational support facility, athletic facility, or administrative office within the political subdivision's jurisdiction or on any specific property located within the jurisdiction of the political subdivision that it could not take against a school district.  A political subdivision shall grant approval in the same manner and follow the same timelines as if the charter school were a school district located in that political subdivision's jurisdiction, provided that, for a new campus, the charter school provide notice, in the manner provided by and to the persons listed in Section [12.1101](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=12.1101), of the location of the new campus within 20 business days of closing on the purchase or lease of real property for that campus.
    
    (j)  This section applies to both owned and leased property of the open-enrollment charter school under Section [12.128](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=12.128).
    
    (k)  Except as otherwise provided by this section, this section does not affect the authority granted by state law to a political subdivision to regulate an open-enrollment charter school through applicable health and safety ordinances imposed by the political subdivision.
    
    (l)  In this section, "political subdivision" does not include a school district.
    
    (m)  This subsection applies only to information of a financial nature related to property transactions of an open-enrollment charter school subject to this section.  A nonprofit entity operating an open-enrollment charter school under Chapter [12](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=12) or a management company providing management services to the nonprofit entity is considered a governmental body for purposes of Chapter [552](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552), Government Code, and financial information related to property transactions that is managed or possessed by the entity or company is subject to disclosure under Chapter [552](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=552), Government Code.

    Sec. 12.106.  STATE FUNDING.
    
    (a)  A charter holder is entitled to receive for the open-enrollment charter school funding under Chapter [48](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48) equal to the amount of funding per student in weighted average daily attendance, excluding the adjustment under Section [48.052](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.052), the funding under Sections [48.101](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.101), [48.110](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.110), [48.111](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.111), and [48.112](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.112), and enrichment funding under Section [48.202](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.202)(a), to which the charter holder would be entitled for the school under Chapter [48](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48) if the school were a school district without a tier one local share for purposes of Section [48.266](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.266).
    
    (a-1)  In determining funding for an open-enrollment charter school under Subsection (a), the amount of the allotment under Section [48.102](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.102) is based solely on the basic allotment to which the charter holder is entitled and does not include any amount based on the allotment under Section [48.101](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.101).
    
    (a-2)  In addition to the funding provided by Subsection (a), a charter holder is entitled to receive for the open-enrollment charter school an allotment per student in average daily attendance in an amount equal to the difference between:
    
    (1)  the product of:
    
    (A)  the quotient of:
    
    (i)  the total amount of funding provided to eligible school districts under Section [48.101](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.101)(b) or (c); and
    
    (ii)  the total number of students in average daily attendance in school districts that receive an allotment under Section [48.101](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.101)(b) or (c); and

    (i)  the total number of students in average daily attendance in school districts that receive an allotment under Section [48.101](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.101)(b) or (c); and
    
    (ii)  the total number of students in average daily attendance in school districts statewide; and
    
    (2)  $125.
    
    (a-3)  In addition to the funding provided by Subsections (a) and (a-2), a charter holder is entitled to receive for the open-enrollment charter school enrichment funding under Section [48.202](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.202) based on the state average tax effort.
    
    (a-4)  In addition to the funding provided by Subsections (a), (a-2), and (a-3), a charter holder is entitled to receive funding for the open-enrollment charter school under Sections [48.110](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.110) and [48.112](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.112) and Subchapter [D](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.151), Chapter [48](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48), if the charter holder would be entitled to the funding if the school were a school district.
    
    (a-5)  To ensure compliance with the requirements for the maintenance of state financial support for special education under 20 U.S.C. Section 1412(a)(18), in determining the funding for an open-enrollment charter school under Subsection (a) for the Section [48.102](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=48.102) allotment, the commissioner shall:
    
    (1)  if necessary, increase the amount of that allotment to an amount equal to the amount the charter holder was entitled to receive for the charter school under the allotment under former Section 42.151, Education Code, for the 2018-2019 school year; and
    
    (2)  reduce the amount of the allotment the charter holder is entitled to receive for the charter school under Subsection (a-2) by the amount of any increase provided for the charter school under Subdivision (1).
    
    (a-6)  Subsection (a-5) and this subsection expire September 1, 2025.
    
    (b)  An open-enrollment charter school is entitled to funds that are available to school districts from the agency or the commissioner in the form of grants or other discretionary funding unless the statute authorizing the funding explicitly provides that open-enrollment charter schools are not entitled to the funding.
    
    (c)  The commissioner may adopt rules to provide and account for state funding of open-enrollment charter schools under this section.  A rule adopted under this section may be similar to a provision of this code that is not similar to Section [12.104](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=12.104)(b) if the commissioner determines that the rule is related to financing of open-enrollment charter schools and is necessary or prudent to provide or account for state funds.
    
    (d)  Subject to Subsection (e), in addition to other amounts provided by this section, a charter holder is entitled to receive, for the open-enrollment charter school, funding per student in average daily attendance in an amount equal to the guaranteed level of state and local funds per student per cent of tax effort under Section [46.032](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=46.032)(a) multiplied by the lesser of:
    
    (1)  the state average interest and sinking fund tax rate imposed by school districts for the current year; or
    
    (2)  a rate that would result in a total amount to which charter schools are entitled under this subsection for the current year equal to $60 million.
    
    (e)  A charter holder is entitled to receive funding under Subsection (d) only if the most recent overall performance rating assigned to the open-enrollment charter school under Subchapter [C](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39.051), Chapter [39](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39), reflects at least acceptable performance.  This subsection does not apply to a charter holder that operates a school program located at a day treatment facility, residential treatment facility, psychiatric hospital, or medical hospital.
    
    (f)  Funds received by a charter holder under Subsection (d) may only be used:
    
    (1)  to lease an instructional facility;
    
    (2)  to pay property taxes imposed on an instructional facility;
    
    (3)  to pay debt service on bonds issued to finance an instructional facility; or
    
    (4)  for any other purpose related to the purchase, lease, sale, acquisition, or maintenance of an instructional facility.
    
    (g)  In this section, "instructional facility" has the meaning assigned by Section [46.001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=46.001).
    
    (h)  Except as provided by Subsection (i), all remaining funds of a charter holder for an open-enrollment charter school that ceases to operate must be returned to the agency and deposited in the charter school liquidation fund.
    
    (i)  The agency may approve a transfer of a charter holder's remaining funds to another charter holder if the charter holder receiving the funds has not received notice of the expiration or revocation of the charter holder's charter for an open-enrollment charter school or notice of a reconstitution of the governing body of the charter holder under Section [12.1141](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=12.1141) or [12.115](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=12.115).
    
    (j)  The commissioner may adopt rules specifying:
    
    (1)  the time during which a former charter holder must return remaining funds under Subsection (h); and
    
    (2)  the qualifications required for a charter holder to receive a transfer of remaining funds under Subsection (i).

    (2)  the charter holder has been assigned a financial performance accountability rating under Subchapter [D](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39.081), Chapter [39](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39), indicating financial performance that is satisfactory or better for the three preceding school years; and
    
    (3)  no campus operating under the charter has been assigned an unacceptable performance rating under Subchapter [C](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39.051), Chapter [39](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39), for the three preceding school years or such a campus has been closed.
    
    (c)  At the end of the term of a charter for an open-enrollment charter school, if a charter holder submits to the commissioner a petition for renewal of the charter and the charter does not meet the criteria for expedited renewal under Subsection (b) or for expiration under Subsection (d), the commissioner shall use the discretionary consideration process.  The commissioner's decision under the discretionary consideration process must take into consideration the results of annual evaluations under the performance frameworks established under Section [12.1181](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=12.1181).  The renewal of the charter of an open-enrollment charter school that is registered under the agency's alternative education accountability procedures for evaluation under Chapter [39](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39) shall be considered under the discretionary consideration process regardless of the performance ratings under Subchapter [C](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39.051), Chapter [39](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39), of the open-enrollment charter school or of any campus operating under the charter, except that if the charter holder has been assigned a financial accountability performance rating under Subchapter [D](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39.081), Chapter [39](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39), indicating financial performance that is lower than satisfactory for any three of the five preceding school years, the commissioner shall allow the charter to expire under Subsection (d).  In considering the renewal of the charter of an open-enrollment charter school that is registered under the agency's alternative education accountability procedures for evaluation under Chapter [39](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39), such as a dropout recovery school or a school providing education within a residential treatment facility, the commissioner shall use academic criteria established by commissioner rule that are appropriate to measure the specific goals of the school.  The criteria established by the commissioner shall recognize growth in student achievement as well as educational attainment.  For purposes of this subsection, the commissioner shall designate as a dropout recovery school an open-enrollment charter school or a campus of an open-enrollment charter school:
    
    (1)  that serves students in grades 9 through 12 and has an enrollment of which at least 60 percent of the students are 16 years of age or older as of September 1 of the school year as reported for the fall semester Public Education Information Management System (PEIMS) submission; and
    
    (2)  that meets the eligibility requirements for and is registered under alternative education accountability procedures adopted by the commissioner.
    
    (d)  At the end of the term of a charter for an open-enrollment charter school, if a charter holder submits to the commissioner a petition for renewal of the charter, the commissioner may not renew the charter and shall allow the charter to expire if:
    
    (1)  the charter holder has been assigned an unacceptable performance rating under Subchapter [C](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39.051), Chapter [39](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39), for any three of the five preceding school years;
    
    (2)  the charter holder has been assigned a financial accountability performance rating under Subchapter [D](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39.081), Chapter [39](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39), indicating financial performance that is lower than satisfactory for any three of the five preceding school years;
    
    (3)  the charter holder has been assigned any combination of the ratings described by Subdivision (1) or (2) for any three of the five preceding school years; or
    
    (4)  any campus operating under the charter has been assigned an unacceptable performance rating under Subchapter [C](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39.051), Chapter [39](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&Value=39), for the three preceding school years and such a campus has not been closed.
    
    (e)  Notwithstanding any other law, a determination by the commissioner under Subsection (d) is final and may not be appealed.
    
    (f)  Not later than the 90th day after the date on which a charter holder submits a petition for renewal of a charter for an open-enrollment charter school at the end of the term of the charter, the commissioner shall provide written notice to the charter holder, in accordance with commissioner rule, of the basis on which the charter qualified for expedited renewal, discretionary consideration, or expiration, and of the commissioner's decision regarding whether to renew the charter, deny renewal of the charter, or allow the charter to expire.
    
    (g)  Except as provided by Subsection (e), a decision by the commissioner to deny renewal of a charter for an open-enrollment charter school is subject to review by the State Office of Administrative Hearings.  Notwithstanding Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code:
    
    (1)  the administrative law judge shall uphold a decision by the commissioner to deny renewal of a charter for an open-enrollment charter school unless the judge finds the decision is arbitrary and capricious or clearly erroneous; and
    
    (2)  a decision of the administrative law judge under this subsection is final and may not be appealed.
    
    (h)  If a charter holder submits a petition for renewal of a charter for an open-enrollment charter school, notwithstanding the expiration date of the charter, the charter term is extended until the commissioner has provided notice to the charter holder of the renewal, denial of renewal, or expiration of the charter.
    
    (i)  The term of a charter renewed under this section is 10 years for each renewal.
    
    (j)  The commissioner shall adopt rules to modify criteria for renewal, denial of renewal, or expiration of a charter for an open-enrollment charter school under this section to the extent necessary to address changes in performance rating categories or in the financial accountability system under Chapter [39](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=39).

    (1)  for each credit earned by a student enrolled in the adult education program during the preceding school year:
