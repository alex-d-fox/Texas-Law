    Sec. 651.5026.  TEMPORARY LICENSE SUSPENSION OR RESTRICTION;  DISCIPLINARY PANEL.  (a)  The presiding officer of the commission shall appoint a three-member disciplinary panel composed of two funeral industry members and one public member of the commission to determine whether a funeral director's or embalmer's license should be temporarily suspended or restricted.
    
    (b)  Chapter [551](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=551), Government Code, does not prohibit the disciplinary panel from holding a meeting by telephone conference call if convening the panel at one location is inconvenient for any member of the panel.
    
    (c)  The disciplinary panel shall temporarily suspend or restrict the license if the panel determines from the information presented to it with or without a hearing, that the license holder has violated this chapter or a rule adopted under this chapter and would, by the license holder's continued unrestricted activity, constitute a continuing threat to the public welfare.
    
    (d)  The suspension or restriction may be without notice or hearing if:
    
    (1)  the commission immediately provides notice of the suspension or restriction to the funeral director or embalmer;
    
    (2)  proceedings for a hearing under Section [651.506](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=651.506) are initiated simultaneously with the suspension or restriction;  and
    
    (3)  the hearing is held as required by Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code, and this chapter not later than 48 hours after the suspension or restriction.
    
    (e)  If the disciplinary panel affirms the temporary suspension or restriction at a hearing, the commission shall schedule an informal compliance meeting that meets the requirements of Section [2001.054](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001.054)(c), Government Code, and this chapter to be held as soon as practicable unless:
    
    (1)  it is evident from the determination of the panel that the funeral director or embalmer would be unable to show compliance at the informal meeting regarding the issues that are the basis for the temporary suspension or restriction;  or
    
    (2)  an informal meeting has already been held regarding the issues that are the basis for the temporary suspension or restriction.
    
    (f)  If the funeral director or embalmer is unable to show compliance at the informal meeting under Subsection (e), the commission shall file a formal complaint under this chapter as soon as practicable.
    
    (g)  If the disciplinary panel does not temporarily suspend or restrict the license after considering the information presented to it at a hearing under Subsection (c), the facts that were the basis for the temporary suspension or restriction may not be the sole basis of another proceeding to temporarily suspend or restrict the funeral director's or embalmer's license.  The commission may use those same facts in a later investigation to obtain new information that may be the basis for the temporary suspension or restriction of a funeral director's or embalmer's license, including facts presented to the disciplinary panel and facts known to the commission at the time evidence was presented to the disciplinary panel.
