    Sec. 157.001.  GENERAL AUTHORITY OF PHYSICIAN TO DELEGATE.  (a)  A physician may delegate to a qualified and properly trained person acting under the physician's supervision any medical act that a reasonable and prudent physician would find within the scope of sound medical judgment to delegate if, in the opinion of the delegating physician:
    
    (1)  the act:
    
    (A)  can be properly and safely performed by the person to whom the medical act is delegated;
    
    (B)  is performed in its customary manner;  and
    
    (C)  is not in violation of any other statute;  and
    
    (2)  the person to whom the delegation is made does not represent to the public that the person is authorized to practice medicine.
    
    (b)  The delegating physician remains responsible for the medical acts of the person performing the delegated medical acts.
    
    (c)  The board may determine whether:
    
    (1)  an act constitutes the practice of medicine, not inconsistent with this chapter;  and
    
    (2)  a medical act may be properly or safely delegated by physicians.

    (2)  "Provision" means the supply of one or more unit doses of a drug, medicine, or dangerous drug.
    
    (b)  A physician may delegate to any qualified and properly trained person acting under the physician's supervision the act of administering or providing dangerous drugs in the physician's office, as ordered by the physician, that are used or required to meet the immediate needs of the physician's patients.  The administration or provision of the dangerous drugs must be performed in compliance with laws relating to the practice of medicine and state and federal laws relating to those dangerous drugs.
