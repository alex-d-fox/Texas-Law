    (a-1)  The board by rule may adopt a system under which licenses expire on various dates during the year.
    
    (b)  Dates of license suspension and reinstatement after failure to pay the license fee shall be adjusted accordingly.

    (d-2)  The board may renew the license of a person whose license has been expired for one year or more without requiring the person to comply with the requirements and procedures for an original license if the person places the person's renewed license on retired status and confines the person's practice solely to voluntary charity care under Section [256.102](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=256.102)(f).
