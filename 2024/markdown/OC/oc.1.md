    CHAPTER 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 1.001.  PURPOSE OF CODE.  (a)  This code is enacted as a part of the state's continuing statutory revision program, begun by the Texas Legislative Council in 1963 as directed by the legislature in the law codified as Section [323.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=323.007), Government Code.  The program contemplates a topic-by-topic revision of the state's general and permanent statute law without substantive change.
    
    (b)  Consistent with the objectives of the statutory revision program, the purpose of this code is to make the law encompassed by this code more accessible and understandable by:
    
    (1)  rearranging the statutes into a more logical order;
    
    (2)  employing a format and numbering system designed to facilitate citation of the law and to accommodate future expansion of the law;
    
    (3)  eliminating repealed, duplicative, unconstitutional, expired, executed, and other ineffective provisions;  and
    
    (4)  restating the law in modern American English to the greatest extent possible.
    
    
    
    
    Acts 1999, 76th Leg., ch. 388, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1999.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 1.002.  CONSTRUCTION OF CODE.  Chapter [311](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=311), Government Code (Code Construction Act), applies to the construction of each provision in this code except as otherwise expressly provided by this code.

    Sec. 1.003.  REFERENCE IN LAW TO STATUTE REVISED BY CODE.  A reference in a law to a statute or a part of a statute revised by this code is considered to be a reference to the part of this code that revises that statute or part of that statute.
    
    
    
    
    Acts 1999, 76th Leg., ch. 388, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1999.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 1.004.  PREEMPTION.  (a)  Unless expressly authorized by another statute, a municipality or county may not adopt, enforce, or maintain an ordinance, order, or rule regulating conduct in a field of regulation that is occupied by a provision of this code.  An ordinance, order, or rule that violates this section is void, unenforceable, and inconsistent with this code.
    
    (b)  Subsection (a) may not be construed to affect municipal or county authority to regulate a massage establishment in accordance with Section [455.005](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=455.005).
