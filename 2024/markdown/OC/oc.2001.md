    (e)  Notwithstanding Subsection (d), the commission may issue temporary licenses to one or more licensed authorized organizations that conduct bingo at the same location as an organization that has ceased or will cease to conduct bingo, which are in addition to the number of temporary licenses each organization is entitled to under another provision of this chapter.

    (1)  credible evidence of circumstances beyond the control of the organization, including force majeure; or

    (b)  Bingo is permitted in an area only as the result of a successful election held under this chapter.
    
    (c)  To the extent that the results of local option elections held by different types of political subdivisions conflict with regard to the same territory, the relative dates of the elections are of no consequence and the following rules apply:
    
    (1)  the status of an area as determined by a municipal election prevails over a contrary status as determined by a justice precinct or county election;  and
    
    (2)  the status of an area as determined by a justice precinct election prevails over the contrary status of the area as determined by a county election.
    
    (d)  If two or more local option elections held at the justice precinct level apply to the same territory, the most recent election prevails.
    
    (e)  If a municipality has established a status by a municipal election, territory annexed to the municipality after that status is established assumes the status under this chapter of the rest of the municipality.  Territory detached from the municipality assumes the status the territory would have had if it had never been a part of the municipality.  If the detached territory is added to another municipality that has established a status by a municipal election, the territory assumes the status of the municipality to which it is added.
    
    (f)  The addition of territory to or detachment of territory from a justice precinct does not affect the status under this chapter of the added or detached territory, except that in a county with a population of more than 3.3 million the added or detached territory assumes the status of the justice precinct of which it becomes a part.  The abolition of a justice precinct does not affect the status under this chapter of the territory formerly within the justice precinct.
