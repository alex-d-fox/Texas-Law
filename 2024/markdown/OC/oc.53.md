    (d)  A licensing authority may consider a person to have been convicted of an offense for purposes of this section regardless of whether the proceedings were dismissed and the person was discharged as described by Subsection (c) if:

    (b)  If a licensing authority determines that the requestor is ineligible for a license, the licensing authority shall issue a letter setting out each basis for potential ineligibility, including any factor considered under Section [53.022](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=53.022) or [53.023](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=53.023) that served as the basis for potential ineligibility, and the authority's determination as to eligibility.
