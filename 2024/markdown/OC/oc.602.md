    (1)  pay the penalty; or
    
    (2)  file a petition for judicial review of the medical board's order contesting the occurrence of the violation, the amount of the penalty, or both.

The person who files an affidavit has the burden of proving that the person is financially unable to pay the penalty or to give a supersedeas bond.
    
    (d)  If the person does not pay the penalty and the enforcement of the penalty is not stayed, the penalty may be collected.  The attorney general may sue to collect the penalty.
    
    (e)  If the court sustains the determination that a violation occurred, the court may uphold or reduce the amount of the penalty and order the person to pay the full or reduced amount of the penalty.
    
    (f)  If the court does not sustain the determination that a violation occurred, the court shall order that a penalty is not owed.
    
    (g)  If the person paid the penalty and if the amount of the penalty is reduced or the penalty is not upheld by the court, the court shall order, when the court's judgment becomes final, that the appropriate amount plus accrued interest be remitted to the person within 30 days after the date that the judgment of the court becomes final.  The interest accrues at the rate charged on loans to depository institutions by the New York Federal Reserve Bank.  The interest shall be paid for the period beginning on the date the penalty is paid and ending on the date the penalty is remitted.
    
    (h)  If the person gave a supersedeas bond and the penalty is not upheld by the court, the court shall order, when the court's judgment becomes final, the release of the bond.  If the person gave a supersedeas bond and the amount of the penalty is reduced, the court shall order the release of the bond after the person pays the reduced amount.
