    Sec. 1702.282.  CRIMINAL HISTORY CHECK.  (a)  The department shall conduct a criminal history check, including a check of any criminal history record information maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in the manner provided by Subchapter [F](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=411.081), Chapter [411](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=411), Government Code, on each applicant for a license or security officer commission issued under this chapter.  As part of its criminal history check, the department may request that the applicant provide certified copies of relevant court documents or other records.  The failure to provide the requested records within a reasonable time as determined by the department may result in the application being considered incomplete.  An applicant is not eligible for a license or security officer commission issued under this chapter if the check reveals that the applicant has committed an act that constitutes grounds for the denial of the license or commission.  Except as provided by Subsection (d), each applicant shall submit at the time of application, including an application for the renewal of a license or security officer commission issued under this chapter, fingerprints in the manner prescribed by the department accompanied by the fee set by the commission.
    
    (b)  Before beginning employment as a commissioned security officer, the applicant must be approved by the department based on the results of the check under Subsection (a).  To continue employment in a capacity regulated under this chapter other than as a commissioned security officer, the applicant must be approved by the department based on the results of the check under Subsection (a) not later than the 120th day after the date the applicant begins employment in that capacity.
    
    (c)  A license or security officer commission issued by the department is conditional on the department's review of criminal history record information.
    
    (d)  An applicant who is a peace officer is not required to submit fingerprints with the applicant's application.  On request, the law enforcement agency or other entity that employs the peace officer or the entity that maintains the peace officer's fingerprints shall provide the fingerprints for the peace officer to the department.  The applicant shall provide sufficient information to the department to enable the department to obtain the fingerprints under this subsection.
    
    (e)  On receipt of notice that a check of the applicant's criminal record has uncovered an unresolved and potentially disqualifying arrest that occurred before the 10th anniversary of the date the application is filed, the applicant must provide a letter of reference from the county sheriff, prosecuting attorney, or judge of the county in which the applicant was arrested stating that a record of a disposition related to the arrest does not exist, and to the best of the county sheriff's, prosecuting attorney's, or judge's knowledge the applicant is free of any disqualifying convictions.  If the applicant fails to provide either the letter of reference or documentary proof of the final disposition of the arrest, the application is considered incomplete and the applicant may not be issued a license or security officer commission under this chapter.

    Sec. 1702.364.  SUMMARY ACTIONS.  (a)  On receiving written notice from a law enforcement agency that a person has been charged with or convicted of an offense that would make the person ineligible for a license or security officer commission under Section [1702.113](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=1702.113) or [1702.163](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=1702.163), or a rule adopted under Section [1702.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=1702.004)(b), the commission shall:
    
    (1)  summarily deny the person's application for a license or security officer commission;
    
    (2)  in the event of pending charges, summarily suspend the person's license or security officer commission; or
    
    (3)  in the event of a conviction, summarily revoke the person's license or security officer commission.
    
    (b)  To initiate a proceeding to take action under Subsection (a), the department must serve notice to the person.  The notice must:
    
    (1)  inform the person of the person's right to a hearing before the department or the department's designee;
    
    (2)  state the basis for the summary action; and
    
    (3)  be personally served on the person or the person's authorized representative, or sent to the person by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to the person's mailing address as it appears in the department's records.
    
    (c)  The action is effective at the time notice is served.  The person shall immediately surrender to the department any security officer commission, pocket card, or other form of identification issued by the department.
    
    (d)  At a hearing under this section, the person must show cause why:
    
    (1)  the application should not have been denied;
    
    (2)  the license or security officer commission should not have been suspended; or
    
    (3)  the license or commission should not have been revoked.
    
    (e)  Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code, applies to a proceeding under this section for the summary denial of an application for or the summary suspension or revocation of a license or security officer commission.
    
    (f)  The dismissal of a complaint, information, or indictment or an acquittal releases the person from automatic grounds for a summary denial of an application or summary suspension of a license or security officer commission under this section.  A conviction for the offense giving rise to a summary suspension is automatic grounds for immediate, summary revocation.
