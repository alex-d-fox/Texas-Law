    Sec. 2301.359.  TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP BY DEALER.  (a)  A dealer must notify the manufacturer or distributor of a vehicle the dealer is franchised to sell of the dealer's decision to assign, sell, or otherwise transfer a franchise or a controlling interest in the dealership to another person.  The notice is the application by the dealer for approval by the manufacturer or distributor of the transfer.
    
    (b)  Notice under Subsection (a) must:
    
    (1)  be in writing and include the prospective transferee's name, address, financial qualifications, and business experience;  and
    
    (2)  be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested.
    
    (c)  The notice must be accompanied by:
    
    (1)  a copy of pertinent agreements regarding the proposed assignment, sale, or transfer;
    
    (2)  completed application forms and related information generally used by the manufacturer or distributor in reviewing prospective dealers, if the forms are on file with the board;  and
    
    (3)  the prospective transferee's written agreement to comply with the franchise to the extent that the franchise is not in conflict with this chapter.
    
    (d)  Not later than the 60th day after the date of receipt of a notice and application under this section, a manufacturer or distributor shall determine whether a dealer's prospective transferee is qualified and shall send a letter by certified mail, return receipt requested, informing the dealer of the approval or the unacceptability of the prospective transferee.  If the prospective transferee is not acceptable, the manufacturer or distributor shall include a statement setting forth the material reasons for the rejection.
    
    (e)  A manufacturer or distributor may not unreasonably withhold approval of an application filed under Subsection (a). 
    
    (f)  An application filed under this section is approved unless rejected by the manufacturer or distributor in the manner provided by this section.
    
    (g)  In determining whether to approve an application filed under Subsection (a), a manufacturer or distributor may consider:
    
    (1)  the prospective transferee's financial and operational performance as a franchised dealer, if the prospective transferee is or has been a franchised dealer;
    
    (2)  the prospective transferee's moral character; or
    
    (3)  the extent to which a prospective transferee satisfies any criteria developed by the manufacturer or distributor and made available to the prospective transferee, specifically to determine the business experience and financial qualifications of a prospective transferee.
    
    (h)  A manufacturer or distributor may consider the criteria developed under Subsection (g)(3) only if the criteria are in writing, are reasonable, and are uniformly applied in similar situations.
    
    (i)  It is unreasonable for a manufacturer or distributor to reject a prospective transferee who is of good moral character and who satisfies the criteria developed under Subsection (g)(3).

    (d)  If the board's order is that the prospective transferee is not qualified, the board may include in the order:
    
    (1)  specific reasons why the prospective transferee is not qualified;  and
    
    (2)  specific conditions under which the prospective transferee would be qualified.
    
    (e)  If the board's order that a prospective transferee is not qualified includes specific conditions under which the prospective transferee would be qualified, the board may retain jurisdiction of the dispute for a time certain to allow the dealer and prospective transferee to meet the conditions.

    (2)  interest on the amount due computed at the rate applicable to a judgment of a court;  and
    
    (3)  reasonable attorney's fees and costs.
    
    (h)  Notwithstanding any other law, this section does not require a manufacturer, distributor, or representative to repurchase a motor vehicle that:

(a)  Notwithstanding Section [2301.481](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=2301.481)(b)(1), and subject to this section, a dealer may enter into a property use agreement for cash consideration that grants the manufacturer or distributor the exclusive rights to direct the use of the dealership.
    
    (b)  In the event the dealer breaches the terms of the property use agreement described by Subsection (a) by altering the use of the property during the term of the agreement in violation of the agreement, the property use agreement is terminated and the dealer must reimburse the manufacturer or distributor in an amount determined by dividing the amount of the manufacturer's or distributor's cash consideration provided under Subsection (a) by the market value of the property identified in the original property use agreement at the time any necessary real estate has been purchased and any necessary construction has been completed, and multiplying the resulting quotient by the market value of the property at the time of the breach.

    (3)  "Specific use agreement" means a property use agreement that is executed in conjunction with a sale or as part of the terms of a lease by an owner of real property to a transferee for use by the transferee as a dealership under the terms of a franchise executed or to be executed between the owner and the transferee.
    
    (4)  "Transferee" means a person who is a purchaser or lessee of real property subject to a specific use agreement.
    
    (b)  To the extent of any conflict between this section and another section of this chapter regarding a specific use agreement, this section controls.

    (2)  prohibit the sale or sublease of the dealership property by the transferee to a person for a purpose other than the operation of a dealership under a franchise with the owner of the property; or
    
    (3)  make the limitations described by Subdivisions (1) and (2) applicable to any successor or sublessee of the transferee.
    
    (c)  An owner may not coerce or attempt to coerce an existing franchised dealer of the owner to relocate an existing dealership of the same line-make to property that is subject to a specific use agreement.  If it is proven in a civil suit that a person entered into a specific use agreement containing a provision described by Subsection (b) as a result of coercion, the specific use agreement is void.
    
    (d)  A specific use agreement executed in conjunction with the sale of real property may apply only to the necessary real estate.
    
    (e)  A specific use agreement executed in conjunction with the sale of real property to an existing franchised dealer for the purpose of relocating an existing dealership of the same line-make to property that is the subject of the specific use agreement or to a person for the purpose of establishing a new dealership expires on the earliest of:
    
    (1)  the date established by the specific use agreement;
    
    (2)  the termination or discontinuance of the franchise between the parties to the specific use agreement as a result of the owner:
    
    (A)  discontinuing all line-makes applicable to the necessary real estate that are under the control of a manufacturer or distributor holding property use rights for the necessary real estate under the specific use agreement;
    
    (B)  ceasing to do business in this state; or
    
    (C)  changing the distributor or method of distribution of the owner's products in this state;

    (f)  Unless a specific use agreement associated with the sale of property expressly provides otherwise, there is no penalty for the full performance by the transferee and transfer of title to the transferee prior to the time set forth by the contract's terms.
