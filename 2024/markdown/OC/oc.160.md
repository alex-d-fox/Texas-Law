Disclosure to the affected physician of confidential peer review committee information relevant to the matter under review does not constitute waiver of the confidentiality requirements established under this subtitle.
    
    (e)  Unless disclosure is required or authorized by law, a record or determination of or a communication to a medical peer review committee is not subject to subpoena or discovery and is not admissible as evidence in any civil judicial or administrative proceeding without waiver of the privilege of confidentiality executed in writing by the committee.  The evidentiary privileges created by this subtitle may be invoked by a person or organization in a civil judicial or administrative proceeding unless the person or organization secures a waiver of the privilege executed in writing by the chair, vice chair, or secretary of the affected medical peer review committee.
    
    (f)  If, under Sections [160.008](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=160.008)(a) and (b), a person participating in peer review, a medical peer review committee, or a health care entity named as a defendant in a civil action filed as a result of participation in peer review may use otherwise confidential information in the defendant's own defense, a plaintiff in the proceeding may disclose a record or determination of or a communication to a medical peer review committee in rebuttal to information supplied by the defendant.
    
    (g)  A person seeking access to privileged information must plead and prove waiver of the privilege.  A member, employee, or agent of a medical peer review committee who provides access to an otherwise privileged communication or record in cooperation with a law enforcement authority in a criminal investigation is not considered to have waived any privilege established under this subtitle.
    
    
    
    
    Acts 1999, 76th Leg., ch. 388, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1999.

    (b)  A defendant subject to this section may use otherwise confidential information obtained for legitimate internal business and professional purposes, including use in the defendant's own defense.  Use of confidential information under this subsection does not constitute a waiver of the confidential and privileged nature of medical peer review committee proceedings.
    
    (c)  A defendant subject to this section may file a counterclaim in a pending action or may prove a cause of action in a subsequent action to recover defense costs, including court costs, attorney's fees, and damages incurred as a result of the civil action, if the plaintiff's original action is determined to be frivolous or brought in bad faith.
    
    
    
    
    Acts 1999, 76th Leg., ch. 388, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1999.

The disclosure of documents or information under such a subpoena does not constitute a waiver of the privilege associated with medical peer review committee proceedings.
    
    (b)  Failure to comply with a subpoena under Subsection (a) constitutes grounds for disciplinary action against the person or entity by the appropriate licensing board.
    
    
    
    
    Acts 1999, 76th Leg., ch. 388, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1999.

    (3)  a member or employee of the board or any person who assists the board in carrying out its duties or functions provided by law.

    (d)  A person or health care entity required to report to the board may not be found liable in a civil action for failure to report to the board unless the failure was committed knowingly or wilfully, except that the appropriate state licensing body may take action against a licensed person or entity for not reporting as required under this subtitle.
    
    (e)  A member of an expert panel under Section [154.056](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=154.056)(e) and a person serving as a consultant to the board are immune from suit and judgment and may not be subjected to a suit for damages for any investigation, report, recommendation, statement, evaluation, finding, or other action taken without fraud or malice in the course of performing the person's duties in evaluating a medical competency case.
