    CHAPTER 304. NURSE LICENSURE COMPACT
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 304.0015.  NURSE LICENSURE COMPACT.  The Nurse Licensure Compact is enacted and entered into with all other jurisdictions that legally join in the compact, which reads as follows:
    
    NURSE LICENSURE COMPACT
    
      
    
    
    ARTICLE I.  FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSE
    
      
    
    
    (a)  The party states find that:
    
    (1)  the health and safety of the public are affected by the degree of compliance with and the effectiveness of enforcement activities related to state nurse licensure laws;
    
    (2)  violations of nurse licensure and other laws regulating the practice of nursing may result in injury or harm to the public;
    
    (3)  the expanded mobility of nurses and the use of advanced communication technologies as part of our nation's health care delivery system require greater coordination and cooperation among states in the areas of nurse licensure and regulation;
    
    (4)  new practice modalities and technology make compliance with individual state nurse licensure laws difficult and complex;
    
    (5)  the current system of duplicative licensure for nurses practicing in multiple states is cumbersome and redundant for both nurses and states; and
    
    (6)  uniformity of nurse licensure requirements throughout the states promotes public safety and public health benefits.
    
    (b)  The general purposes of this compact are to:
    
    (1)  facilitate the states' responsibility to protect the public's health and safety;
    
    (2)  ensure and encourage the cooperation of party states in the areas of nurse licensure and regulation;
    
    (3)  facilitate the exchange of information between party states in the areas of nurse regulation, investigation, and adverse actions;
    
    (4)  promote compliance with the laws governing the practice of nursing in each jurisdiction;
    
    (5)  invest all party states with the authority to hold a nurse accountable for meeting all state practice laws in the state in which the patient is located at the time care is rendered through the mutual recognition of party state licenses;
    
    (6)  decrease redundancies in the consideration and issuance of nurse licenses; and
    
    (7)  provide opportunities for interstate practice by nurses who meet uniform licensure requirements.
    
    ARTICLE II.  DEFINITIONS
    
      
    
    
    As used in this compact:
    
    (a)  "Adverse action" means any administrative, civil, equitable, or criminal action permitted by a state's laws that is imposed by a licensing board or other authority against a nurse, including actions against an individual's license or multistate licensure privilege such as revocation, suspension, probation, monitoring of the licensee, limitation on the licensee's practice, or any other encumbrance on licensure affecting a nurse's authorization to practice, including issuance of a cease and desist action.
    
    (b)  "Alternative program" means a nondisciplinary monitoring program approved by a licensing board.

    (d)  "Current significant investigative information" means:
    
    (1)  investigative information that a licensing board, after a preliminary inquiry that includes notification and an opportunity for the nurse to respond, if required by state law, has reason to believe is not groundless and, if proven true, would indicate more than a minor infraction; or
    
    (2)  investigative information that indicates that the nurse represents an immediate threat to public health and safety regardless of whether the nurse has been notified and had an opportunity to respond.
    
    (e)  "Encumbrance" means a revocation or suspension of, or any limitation on, the full and unrestricted practice of nursing imposed by a licensing board.

    ARTICLE III.  GENERAL PROVISIONS AND JURISDICTION
    
      
    
    
    (a)  A multistate license to practice registered or licensed practical/vocational nursing issued by a home state to a resident in that state will be recognized by each party state as authorizing a nurse to practice as a registered nurse (RN) or as a licensed practical/vocational nurse (LPN/VN), under a multistate licensure privilege, in each party state.
    
    (b)  A state must implement procedures for considering the criminal history records of applicants for initial multistate license or licensure by endorsement. Such procedures shall include the submission of fingerprints or other biometric-based information by applicants for the purpose of obtaining an applicant's criminal history record information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the agency responsible for retaining that state's criminal records.
    
    (c)  Each party state shall require the following for an applicant to obtain or retain a multistate license in the home state:
    
    (1)  meets the home state's qualifications for licensure or renewal of licensure, as well as all other applicable state laws;
    
    (2)(i)  has graduated or is eligible to graduate from a licensing board-approved RN or LPN/VN prelicensure education program; or
    
    (ii)  has graduated from a foreign RN or LPN/VN prelicensure education program that (a) has been approved by the authorized accrediting body in the applicable country and (b) has been verified by an independent credentials review agency to be comparable to a licensing board-approved prelicensure education program;
    
    (3)  has, if a graduate of a foreign prelicensure education program not taught in English or if English is not the individual's native language, successfully passed an English proficiency examination that includes the components of reading, speaking, writing, and listening;
    
    (4)  has successfully passed an NCLEX-RN or NCLEX-PN Examination or a recognized predecessor, as applicable;
    
    (5)  is eligible for or holds an active, unencumbered license;
    
    (6)  has submitted, in connection with an application for initial licensure or licensure by endorsement, fingerprints or other biometric data for the purpose of obtaining criminal history record information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the agency responsible for retaining that state's criminal records;
    
    (7)  has not been convicted or found guilty, or has entered into an agreed disposition, of a felony offense under applicable state or federal criminal law;
    
    (8)  has not been convicted or found guilty, or has entered into an agreed disposition, of a misdemeanor offense related to the practice of nursing as determined on a case-by-case basis;
    
    (9)  is not currently enrolled in an alternative program;
    
    (10)  is subject to self-disclosure requirements regarding current participation in an alternative program; and
    
    (11)  has a valid United States social security number.
    
    (d)  All party states shall be authorized, in accordance with existing state due process law, to take adverse action against a nurse's multistate licensure privilege such as revocation, suspension, probation, or any other action that affects a nurse's authorization to practice under a multistate licensure privilege, including cease and desist actions.  If a party state takes such action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system.  The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the home state of any such actions by remote states.
    
    (e)  A nurse practicing in a party state must comply with the state practice laws of the state in which the client is located at the time service is provided.  The practice of nursing is not limited to patient care, but shall include all nursing practice as defined by the state practice laws of the party state in which the client is located.  The practice of nursing in a party state under a multistate licensure privilege will subject a nurse to the jurisdiction of the licensing board, the courts, and the laws of the party state in which the client is located at the time service is provided.
    
    (f)  Individuals not residing in a party state shall continue to be able to apply for a party state's single-state license as provided under the laws of each party state.  However, the single-state license granted to these individuals will not be recognized as granting the privilege to practice nursing in any other party state. Nothing in this compact shall affect the requirements established by a party state for the issuance of a single-state license.
    
    (g)  Any nurse holding a home state multistate license, on the effective date of this compact, may retain and renew the multistate license issued by the nurse's then-current home state, provided that:
    
    (1)  a nurse, who changes primary state of residence after this compact's effective date, must meet all applicable Article III(c) requirements to obtain a multistate license from the new home state; or
    
    (2)  a nurse who fails to satisfy the multistate licensure requirements in Article III(c) due to a disqualifying event occurring after this compact's effective date shall be ineligible to retain or renew a multistate license, and the nurse's multistate license shall be revoked or deactivated in accordance with applicable rules adopted by the Interstate Commission of Nurse Licensure Compact Administrators ("commission").
    
    ARTICLE IV.  APPLICATIONS FOR LICENSURE IN A PARTY STATE
    
      
    
    
    (a)  Upon application for a multistate license, the licensing board in the issuing party state shall ascertain, through the coordinated licensure information system, whether the applicant has ever held, or is the holder of, a license issued by any other state, whether there are any encumbrances on any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant, whether any adverse action has been taken against any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant, and whether the applicant is currently participating in an alternative program.
    
    (b)  A nurse may hold a multistate license, issued by the home state, in only one party state at a time.
    
    (c)  If a nurse changes primary state of residence by moving between two party states, the nurse must apply for licensure in the new home state, and the multistate license issued by the prior home state will be deactivated in accordance with applicable rules adopted by the commission.
    
    (1)  The nurse may apply for licensure in advance of a change in primary state of residence.
    
    (2)  A multistate license shall not be issued by the new home state until the nurse provides satisfactory evidence of a change in primary state of residence to the new home state and satisfies all applicable requirements to obtain a multistate license from the new home state.
    
    (d)  If a nurse changes primary state of residence by moving from a party state to a nonparty state, the multistate license issued by the prior home state will convert to a single-state license, valid only in the former home state.
    
    ARTICLE V.  ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES INVESTED IN PARTY STATE LICENSING BOARDS
    
      
    
    
    (a)  In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a licensing board shall have the authority to:
    
    (1)  take adverse action against a nurse's multistate licensure privilege to practice within that party state.
    
    (i)  Only the home state shall have the power to take adverse action against a nurse's license issued by the home state.
    
    (ii)  For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state licensing board shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a remote state as it would if such conduct had occurred within the home state.  In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action.
    
    (2)  issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on a nurse's authority to practice within that party state.
    
    (3)  complete any pending investigation of a nurse who changes primary state of residence during the course of such investigation.  The licensing board shall also have the authority to take appropriate action(s) and shall promptly report the conclusions of such investigations to the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the new home state of any such actions.
    
    (4)  issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and testimony of a witness, as well as the production of evidence.  Subpoenas issued by a licensing board in a party state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another party state shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedures of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before it.  The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service statutes of the state in which the witnesses or evidence are located.
    
    (5)  obtain and submit, for each nurse licensure applicant, fingerprint or other biometric-based information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for criminal background checks, receive the results of the Federal Bureau of Investigation record search on criminal background checks, and use the results in making licensure decisions.
    
    (6)  if otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected nurse the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that nurse.
    
    (7)  take adverse action based on the factual findings of the remote state, provided that the licensing board follows its own procedures for taking such adverse action.
    
    (b)  If adverse action is taken by the home state against a nurse's multistate license, the nurse's multistate licensure privilege to practice in all other party states shall be deactivated until all encumbrances have been removed from the multistate license. All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against a nurse's multistate license shall include a statement that the nurse's multistate licensure privilege is deactivated in all party states during the pendency of the order.
    
    (c)  Nothing in this compact shall override a party state's decision that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action. The home state licensing board shall deactivate the multistate licensure privilege under the multistate license of any nurse for the duration of the nurse's participation in an alternative program.
    
    ARTICLE VI.  COORDINATED LICENSURE INFORMATION SYSTEM AND EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION
    
      
    
    
    (a)  All party states shall participate in a coordinated licensure information system of all licensed registered nurses (RNs) and licensed practical/vocational nurses (LPNs/VNs).  This system will include information on the licensure and disciplinary history of each nurse, as submitted by party states, to assist in the coordination of nurse licensure and enforcement efforts.
    
    (b)  The commission, in consultation with the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system, shall formulate necessary and proper procedures for the identification, collection, and exchange of information under this compact.
    
    (c)  All licensing boards shall promptly report to the coordinated licensure information system any adverse action, any current significant investigative information, denials of applications (with the reasons for such denials), and nurse participation in alternative programs known to the licensing board regardless of whether such participation is deemed nonpublic or confidential under state law.
    
    (d)  Current significant investigative information and participation in nonpublic or confidential alternative programs shall be transmitted through the coordinated licensure information system only to party state licensing boards.
    
    (e)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all party state licensing boards contributing information to the coordinated licensure information system may designate information that may not be shared with nonparty states or disclosed to other entities or individuals without the express permission of the contributing state.
    
    (f)  Any personally identifiable information obtained from the coordinated licensure information system by a party state licensing board shall not be shared with nonparty states or disclosed to other entities or individuals except to the extent permitted by the laws of the party state contributing the information.
    
    (g)  Any information contributed to the coordinated licensure information system that is subsequently required to be expunged by the laws of the party state contributing that information shall also be expunged from the coordinated licensure information system.
    
    (h)  The compact administrator of each party state shall furnish a uniform data set to the compact administrator of each other party state, which shall include, at a minimum:
    
    (1)  identifying information;
    
    (2)  licensure data;
    
    (3)  information related to alternative program participation; and
    
    (4)  other information that may facilitate the administration of this compact, as determined by commission rules.
    
    (i)  The compact administrator of a party state shall provide all investigative documents and information requested by another party state.
    
    ARTICLE VII.  ESTABLISHMENT OF INTERSTATE COMMISSION OF NURSE LICENSURE COMPACT ADMINISTRATORS

The commission shall keep minutes that fully and clearly describe all matters discussed in a meeting and shall provide a full and accurate summary of actions taken, and the reasons therefor, including a description of the views expressed.  All documents considered in connection with an action shall be identified in such minutes.  All minutes and documents of a closed meeting shall remain under seal, subject to release by a majority vote of the commission or order of a court of competent jurisdiction.
    
    (c)  The commission shall, by a majority vote of the administrators, prescribe bylaws or rules to govern its conduct as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes and exercise the powers of this compact, including but not limited to:
    
    (1)  establishing the fiscal year of the commission;

    (3)  providing reasonable procedures for calling and conducting meetings of the commission, ensuring reasonable advance notice of all meetings, and providing an opportunity for attendance of such meetings by interested parties, with enumerated exceptions designed to protect the public's interest, the privacy of individuals, and proprietary information, including trade secrets.  The commission may meet in closed session only after a majority of the administrators vote to close a meeting in whole or in part.  As soon as practicable, the commission must make public a copy of the vote to close the meeting revealing the vote of each administrator, with no proxy votes allowed;
    
    (4)  establishing the titles, duties and authority, and reasonable procedures for the election of the officers of the commission;

    (1)  The commission shall pay, or provide for the payment of, the reasonable expenses of its establishment, organization, and ongoing activities.
    
    (2)  The commission may also levy on and collect an annual assessment from each party state to cover the cost of its operations, activities, and staff in its annual budget as approved each year. The aggregate annual assessment amount, if any, shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the commission, which shall promulgate a rule that is binding upon all party states.
    
    (3)  The commission shall not incur an obligation of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same; nor shall the commission pledge the credit of any of the party states, except by and with the authority of such party state.

    (3)  The commission shall indemnify and hold harmless any administrator, officer, executive director, employee, or representative of the commission for the amount of any settlement or judgment obtained against that person arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that such person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from the intentional, wilful, or wanton misconduct of that person.
    
    ARTICLE VIII.  RULEMAKING
    
      
    
    
    (a)  The commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth in this article and the rules adopted thereunder.  Rules and amendments shall become binding as of the date specified in each rule or amendment and shall have the same force and effect as provisions of this compact.
    
    (b)  Rules or amendments to the rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commission.
    
    (c)  Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule or rules by the commission, and at least sixty (60) days in advance of the meeting at which the rule will be considered and voted upon, the commission shall file a notice of proposed rulemaking:
    
    (1)  on the website of the commission; and
    
    (2)  on the website of each licensing board or the publication in which each state would otherwise publish proposed rules.
    
    (d)  The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:
    
    (1)  the proposed time, date, and location of the meeting in which the rule will be considered and voted upon;
    
    (2)  the text of the proposed rule or amendment, and the reason for the proposed rule;
    
    (3)  a request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person; and
    
    (4)  the manner in which interested persons may submit notice to the commission of their intention to attend the public hearing and any written comments.
    
    (e)  Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall allow persons to submit written data, facts, opinions, and arguments, which shall be made available to the public.
    
    (f)  The commission shall grant an opportunity for a public hearing before it adopts a rule or amendment.
    
    (g)  The commission shall publish the place, time, and date of the scheduled public hearing.
    
    (1)  Hearings shall be conducted in a manner providing each person who wishes to comment a fair and reasonable opportunity to comment orally or in writing.  All hearings will be recorded, and a copy will be made available upon request.
    
    (2)  Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings required by this section.
    
    (h)  If no one appears at the public hearing, the commission may proceed with promulgation of the proposed rule.
    
    (i)  Following the scheduled hearing date, or by the close of business on the scheduled hearing date if the hearing was not held, the commission shall consider all written and oral comments received.
    
    (j)  The commission shall, by majority vote of all administrators, take final action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if any, based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.
    
    (k)  Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule without prior notice, opportunity for comment, or hearing; provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in this compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, and in no event later than ninety (90) days after the effective date of the rule.  For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:
    
    (1)  meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
    
    (2)  prevent a loss of commission or party state funds; or
    
    (3)  meet a deadline for the promulgation of an administrative rule that is required by federal law or rule.
    
    (l)  The commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted rule or amendment for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty (30) days after posting.  The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing, and delivered to the commission, prior to the end of the notice period.  If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action.  If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the commission.
    
    ARTICLE IX.  OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT
    
      
    
    
    (a)  Oversight
    
    (1)  Each party state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate this compact's purposes and intent.
    
    (2)  The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding that may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the commission, and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process in such proceeding to the commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.
    
    (b)  Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
    
    (1)  If the commission determines that a party state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall:
    
    (i)  provide written notice to the defaulting state and other party states of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default, or any other action to be taken by the commission; and
    
    (ii)  provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
    
    (2)  If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state's membership in this compact may be terminated upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the administrators, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination.  A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
    
    (3)  Termination of membership in this compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the governor of the defaulting state and to the executive officer of the defaulting state's licensing board and each of the party states.
    
    (4)  A state whose membership in this compact has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of the termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.
    
    (5)  The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or whose membership in this compact has been terminated unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting state.
    
    (6)  The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district in which the commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees.
    
    (c)  Dispute Resolution
    
    (1)  Upon request by a party state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among party states and between party and nonparty states.
    
    (2)  The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes, as appropriate.
    
    (3)  In the event the commission cannot resolve disputes among party states arising under this compact:
    
    (i)  the party states may submit the issues in dispute to an arbitration panel, which will be comprised of individuals appointed by the compact administrator in each of the affected party states and an individual mutually agreed upon by the compact administrators of all the party states involved in the dispute; and
    
    (ii)  the decision of a majority of the arbitrators shall be final and binding.
    
    (d)  Enforcement
    
    (1)  The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact.
    
    (2)  By majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or in the federal district in which the commission has its principal offices against a party state that is in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of this compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws.  The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages.  In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees.
    
    (3)  The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.
    
    ARTICLE X.  EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENTS
    
      
    
    
    (a)  This compact shall become effective and binding on the earlier of the date of legislative enactment of this compact into law by no less than twenty-six (26) states or December 31, 2018. All party states to this compact that also were parties to the prior Nurse Licensure Compact, superseded by this compact ("prior compact"), shall be deemed to have withdrawn from said prior compact within six (6) months after the effective date of this compact.
    
    (b)  Each party state to this compact shall continue to recognize a nurse's multistate licensure privilege to practice in that party state issued under the prior compact until the party state has withdrawn from the prior compact.
    
    (c)  Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same. A party state's withdrawal shall not take effect until six (6) months after enactment of the repealing statute.
    
    (d)  A party state's withdrawal or termination shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing or terminated state's licensing board to report adverse actions and significant investigations occurring prior to the effective date of such withdrawal or termination.
    
    (e)  Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any nurse licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a party state and a nonparty state that is made in accordance with the other provisions of this compact.
    
    (f)  This compact may be amended by the party states. No amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon the party states unless and until it is enacted into the laws of all party states.
    
    (g)  Representatives of nonparty states to this compact shall be invited to participate in the activities of the commission, on a nonvoting basis, prior to the adoption of this compact by all states.
    
    ARTICLE XI.  CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
    
      
    
    
    This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or the United States, or if the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any party state, this compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining party states and in full force and effect as to the party state affected as to all severable matters.
