    Whereas, states license psychologists, in order to protect the public through verification of education, training and experience and ensure accountability for professional practice; and
    
    Whereas, this Compact is intended to regulate the day to day practice of telepsychology (i.e. the provision of psychological services using telecommunication technologies) by psychologists across state boundaries in the performance of their psychological practice as assigned by an appropriate authority; and
    
    Whereas, this Compact is intended to regulate the temporary in-person, face-to-face practice of psychology by psychologists across state boundaries for 30 days within a calendar year in the performance of their psychological practice as assigned by an appropriate authority;
    
    Whereas, this Compact is intended to authorize State Psychology Regulatory Authorities to afford legal recognition, in a manner consistent with the terms of the Compact, to psychologists licensed in another state;
    
    Whereas, this Compact recognizes that states have a vested interest in protecting the public's health and safety through their licensing and regulation of psychologists and that such state regulation will best protect public health and safety;
    
    Whereas, this Compact does not apply when a psychologist is licensed in both the Home and Receiving States; and
    
    Whereas, this Compact does not apply to permanent in-person, face-to-face practice, it does allow for authorization of temporary psychological practice.
    
    Consistent with these principles, this Compact is designed to achieve the following purposes and objectives:
    
    1.  Increase public access to professional psychological services by allowing for telepsychological practice across state lines as well as temporary in-person, face-to-face services into a state which the psychologist is not licensed to practice psychology;
    
    2.  Enhance the states' ability to protect the public's health and safety, especially client/patient safety;
    
    3.  Encourage the cooperation of Compact States in the areas of psychology licensure and regulation;
    
    4.  Facilitate the exchange of information between Compact States regarding psychologist licensure, adverse actions and disciplinary history;
    
    5.  Promote compliance with the laws governing psychological practice in each Compact State; and
    
    6.  Invest all Compact States with the authority to hold licensed psychologists accountable through the mutual recognition of Compact State licenses.

    B.  A Receiving State may take adverse action on a psychologist's Authority to Practice Interjurisdictional Telepsychology within that Receiving State. A Home State may take adverse action against a psychologist based on an adverse action taken by a Distant State regarding temporary in-person, face-to-face practice.
    
    C.  If a Home State takes adverse action against a psychologist's license, that psychologist's Authority to Practice Interjurisdictional Telepsychology is terminated and the E.Passport is revoked. Furthermore, that psychologist's Temporary Authorization to Practice is terminated and the IPC is revoked.
    
    1.  All Home State disciplinary orders which impose adverse action shall be reported to the Commission in accordance with the Rules promulgated by the Commission. A Compact State shall report adverse actions in accordance with the Rules of the Commission.
    
    2.  In the event discipline is reported on a psychologist, the psychologist will not be eligible for telepsychology or temporary in-person, face-to-face practice in accordance with the Rules of the Commission.

    D.  A Home State's Psychology Regulatory Authority shall investigate and take appropriate action with respect to reported inappropriate conduct engaged in by a licensee which occurred in a Receiving State as it would if such conduct had occurred by a licensee within the Home State. In such cases, the Home State's law shall control in determining any adverse action against a psychologist's license.
    
    E.  A Distant State's Psychology Regulatory Authority shall investigate and take appropriate action with respect to reported inappropriate conduct engaged in by a psychologist practicing under Temporary Authorization Practice which occurred in that Distant State as it would if such conduct had occurred by a licensee within the Home State.

    F.  Nothing in this Compact shall override a Compact State's decision that a psychologist's participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action and that such participation shall remain non-public if required by the Compact State's law. Compact States must require psychologists who enter any alternative programs to not provide telepsychology services under the Authority to Practice Interjurisdictional Telepsychology or provide temporary psychological services under the Temporary Authorization to Practice in any other Compact State during the term of the alternative program.
    
    G.  No other judicial or administrative remedies shall be available to a psychologist in the event a Compact State imposes an adverse action pursuant to subsection C, above.

    2.  Issue cease and desist and/or injunctive relief orders to revoke a psychologist's Authority to Practice Interjurisdictional Telepsychology and/or Temporary Authorization to Practice.
    
    3.  During the course of any investigation, a psychologist may not change his/her Home State licensure. A Home State Psychology Regulatory Authority is authorized to complete any pending investigations of a psychologist and to take any actions appropriate under its law. The Home State Psychology Regulatory Authority shall promptly report the conclusions of such investigations to the Commission. Once an investigation has been completed, and pending the outcome of said investigation, the psychologist may change his/her Home State licensure. The Commission shall promptly notify the new Home State of any such decisions as provided in the Rules of the Commission. All information provided to the Commission or distributed by Compact States pursuant to the psychologist shall be confidential, filed under seal and used for investigatory or disciplinary matters. The Commission may create additional rules for mandated or discretionary sharing of information by Compact States.
    
    ARTICLE IX.  COORDINATED LICENSURE INFORMATION SYSTEM

    8.  Other information which may facilitate the administration of this Compact, as determined by the Rules of the Commission.
    
    C.  The Coordinated Database administrator shall promptly notify all Compact States of any adverse action taken against, or significant investigative information on, any licensee in a Compact State.
    
    D.  Compact States reporting information to the Coordinated Database may designate information that may not be shared with the public without the express permission of the Compact State reporting the information.

If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the Commission.
    
    ARTICLE XII.  OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ENFORCEMENT
    
      
    
    
    A.  Oversight
    
    1.  The Executive, Legislative and Judicial branches of state government in each Compact State shall enforce this Compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the Compact's purposes and intent. The provisions of this Compact and the rules promulgated hereunder shall have standing as statutory law.
    
    2.  All courts shall take judicial notice of the Compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a Compact State pertaining to the subject matter of this Compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the Commission.
    
    3.  The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the Commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact or promulgated rules.
    
    B.  Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
    
    1.  If the Commission determines that a Compact State has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated rules, the Commission shall:
    
    a.  Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other Compact States of the nature of the default, the proposed means of remedying the default and/or any other action to be taken by the Commission; and
    
    b.  Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
    
    2.  If a state in default fails to remedy the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the Compact States, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact shall be terminated on the effective date of termination. A remedy of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
    
    3.  Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be submitted by the Commission to the Governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the Compact States.
    
    4.  A Compact State which has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations which extend beyond the effective date of termination.
    
    5.  The Commission shall not bear any costs incurred by the state which is found to be in default or which has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting state.
    
    6.  The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the state of Georgia or the federal district where the Compact has its principal offices. The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
    
    C.  Dispute Resolution
    
    1.  Upon request by a Compact State, the Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact which arise among Compact States and between Compact and Non-Compact States.
    
    2.  The Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes that arise before the commission.
    
    D.  Enforcement
    
    1.  The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and Rules of this Compact.
    
    2.  By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the State of Georgia or the federal district where the Compact has its principal offices against a Compact State in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules and Bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
    
    3.  The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.

    A.  The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the Compact is enacted into law in the seventh Compact State.

Thereafter, the Commission shall meet and exercise rulemaking powers necessary to the implementation and administration of the Compact.
    
    B.  Any state which joins the Compact subsequent to the Commission's initial adoption of the rules shall be subject to the rules as they exist on the date on which the Compact becomes law in that state.

    C.  Any Compact State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute repealing the same.
    
    1.  A Compact State's withdrawal shall not take effect until six (6) months after enactment of the repealing statute.
    
    2.  Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing State's Psychology Regulatory Authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this act prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
    
    D.  Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any psychology licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a Compact State and a Non-Compact State which does not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.
    
    E.  This Compact may be amended by the Compact States. No amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any Compact State until it is enacted into the law of all Compact States.
    
    ARTICLE XIV.  CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
