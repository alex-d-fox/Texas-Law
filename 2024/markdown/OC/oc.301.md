    (2)  maintains an acceptable pass rate as determined by the board on the applicable licensing examination under this chapter.
    
    (d-2)  A school of nursing or educational program that fails to meet or maintain an acceptable pass rate on applicable licensing examinations under this chapter is subject to review by the board.

    (d-4)  The board may recognize and accept as approved under this section a school of nursing or educational program operated in another state and approved by a state board of nursing or other regulatory body of that state.  The board shall adopt rules to ensure that the other state's standards are substantially equivalent to the board's standards.

    (d-7)  A school of nursing or educational program approved under Subsection (d-1) shall:
    
    (1)  provide the board with copies of any reports submitted to or received from the national nursing accrediting agency selected by the board;
    
    (2)  notify the board of any change in accreditation status; and
    
    (3)  provide other information required by the board as necessary to evaluate and establish nursing education and workforce policy in this state.
    
    (d-8)  For purposes of Subsection (d-4), a nursing program  is considered to meet standards substantially equivalent to the board's standards if the program:

    (C)  pass the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses at a rate equivalent to the board's required passage rate for students of approved in-state programs.
    
    (d-9)  A graduate of a clinical competency assessment program operated in another state and approved by a state board of nursing or other regulatory body of another state is eligible to apply for an initial license under this chapter if:
    
    (1)   the program does not make any substantial changes in the length or content of its clinical competency assessment without the board's approval; and
    
    (2)  the program remains in good standing with the state board of nursing or other regulatory body in the other state.
    
    (d-10)  In this section, the terms "clinical competency assessment program" and "supervised clinical learning experiences program" have the meanings assigned by Section 105.008, Health and Safety Code.
    
    (d-11)  If a clinical competency assessment program operated in another state graduates students who pass the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses at a rate lower than the board's required passage rate for graduating students of approved in-state programs, not later than May 31 of the next school year the program shall:
    
    (1)  for the first year the student passage rate is lower than the board's required passage rate for students of approved in-state programs, complete and submit to the board for review and comment a self-study of the program in accordance with the board's guidelines;
    
    (2)  for the second consecutive year the student passage rate is lower than the board's required passage rate for students of approved in-state programs, allow the board to conduct a desk review to evaluate the program using the criteria typically used in an on-site visit and make recommendations to improve the program; and
    
    (3)  for the third consecutive year the student passage rate is lower than the board's required passage rate for students of approved in-state programs, provide notice on the program's Internet website that prospective students of the program may need to complete additional requirements to apply for an initial license in this state because the program has failed to meet the board's standards related to the required passage rate on the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses.
    
    (d-12)  A clinical competency assessment program operated in another state is not considered to meet standards substantially equivalent to the board's standards if the program fails to meet the applicable requirements under Subsection (d-11) or if the program's graduating student passage rate on the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses is lower than the board's required passage rate for graduating students of approved in-state programs for four consecutive years.  A student enrolled in a program described by this subsection before December 31 of the fourth consecutive year is eligible to apply for an initial license under this chapter.

    (2)  is an applicant for a license.
    
    (b)  The petition must state the basis for the person's potential ineligibility.
    
    (c)  The board has the same powers to investigate the petition and the person's eligibility that it has to investigate a person applying for a license.
    
    (d)  The petitioner or the board may amend the petition to include additional grounds for potential ineligibility at any time before a final determination is made.
    
    (e)  If the board determines that a ground for ineligibility does not exist, instead of issuing an order, the board shall notify the petitioner in writing of the board's determination on each ground of potential ineligibility.

    (f)  The board's order must set out each basis for potential ineligibility and the board's determination as to eligibility.  In the absence of new evidence known to but not disclosed by the petitioner or not reasonably available to the board at the time the order is issued, the board's ruling on the petition determines the person's eligibility with respect to the grounds for potential ineligibility set out in the written notice or order.
    
    (g)  The board may require an individual accepted for enrollment or enrolled in an educational program preparing a student for initial licensure as a registered nurse or vocational nurse to submit information to the board to permit the board to determine whether the person is aware of the conditions that may disqualify the person from licensure as a registered nurse or vocational nurse on graduation and of the person's right to petition the board for a declaratory order under this section.  Instead of requiring the person to submit the information, the board may require the educational program to collect and submit the information on each person accepted for enrollment or enrolled in the program.
    
    (h)  The information required under Subsection (g) must be submitted in a form approved by the board.
    
    (i)  If, as a result of information provided under Subsection (g), the board determines that a person may not be eligible for a license on graduation, the board shall notify the educational program of its determination.
    
    (j)  The board may file a petition under this section based on the results of a criminal history record information check conducted under Section [301.2511](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=301.2511).  The board by rule shall adopt requirements for the petition and determination under this subsection.  The rules must:
    
    (1)  identify the criminal offenses that constitute grounds for the board to file the petition; and
    
    (2)  describe the documents required by the board to make a determination of license eligibility.

    (l)  The board may require in a declaratory order under this section that a person begin participation in a peer assistance program at the time of receipt of an initial license under this chapter.  The board shall notify the person that, on issuance of the person's initial license, the person may request reevaluation of the person's required participation in the peer assistance program.
    
    (m)  The board by rule shall develop a process to determine whether a person should continue to be required to participate in a peer assistance program.  In making the determination, the board shall:
    
    (1)  review the person's criminal history record information and, if applicable, determine whether participation in the program is warranted based on the time that has elapsed since the conviction or end of community supervision;
    
    (2)  reevaluate or require a contractor administering a peer assistance program to reevaluate the treatment plan or the time the person is required to participate in the peer assistance program based on the person's individualized needs; and
    
    (3)  authorize, as appropriate, a waiver of peer assistance program completion if the board is satisfied the person has achieved a satisfactory period of treatment or documented sobriety, as defined by board rules, and continued participation is not necessary.

    (g)  If a nurse or applicant refuses to consent to an evaluation under Subsection (f), the nurse or applicant may not introduce an evaluation into evidence at a hearing to determine the nurse's or applicant's right to be issued or retain a nursing license unless the nurse or applicant:
    
    (1)  not later than the 30th day before the date of the hearing, notifies the board that an evaluation will be introduced into evidence at the hearing;
    
    (2)  provides the board the results of that evaluation;

    (B)  included in the findings of fact and conclusions of law in a final board order; and
    
    (C)  disclosed to a peer assistance program approved by the board under Chapter [467](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&Value=467), Health and Safety Code, and to which the board has referred the nurse.
    
    (k)  If the board determines there is insufficient evidence to bring action against a person based on the results of any evaluation under this section, the evaluation must be expunged from the board's records.

    Sec. 301.457.  COMPLAINT AND INVESTIGATION.  (a)  The board or any person may initiate a proceeding under this subchapter by filing with the board a complaint against a nurse.  The complaint must be in writing and signed by the complainant.
    
    (b)  Except as otherwise provided by this section, the board or a person authorized by the board shall conduct each investigation.  Each complaint against a nurse that requires a determination of nursing competency shall be reviewed by a board member, consultant, or employee with a nursing background the board considers sufficient.
    
    (b-1)  The board by rule shall provide for the appointment by the board of advanced practice registered nurses to act as expert reviewers and assist with complaints and investigations relating to alleged standard of care violations by advanced practice registered nurses.
    
    (c)  On the filing of a complaint, the board:
    
    (1)  may conduct a preliminary investigation into the identity of the nurse named or described in the complaint;
    
    (2)  shall make a timely and appropriate preliminary investigation of the complaint;  and
    
    (3)  may issue a warning or reprimand to the nurse.
    
    (d)  After any preliminary investigation to determine the identity of the subject of the complaint, unless it would jeopardize an investigation, the board shall notify the nurse that a complaint has been filed and the nature of the complaint.  If the investigation reveals probable cause to take further disciplinary action, the board shall either attempt an informal disposition of the complaint or file a formal charge against the nurse stating the provision of this chapter or board rule that is alleged to have been violated and a brief description of each act or omission that constitutes the violation.
    
    (e)  The board shall conduct an investigation of the complaint to determine:
    
    (1)  whether the nurse's continued practice of nursing poses a risk of harm to clients or other persons;  and
    
    (2)  whether probable cause exists that a nurse committed an act listed in Section [301.452](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=301.452)(b) or that violates other law.
    
    (f)  In making a determination under Subsection (e), the board shall review the evidence to determine the extent to which a deficiency in care by the registered nurse was the result of deficiencies in the registered nurse's judgment, knowledge, training, or skill rather than other factors beyond the nurse's control.  A determination that a deficiency in care is attributable to a registered nurse must be based on the extent to which the registered nurse's conduct was the result of a deficiency in the registered nurse's judgment, knowledge, training, or skill.
    
    (g)  If the board determines after investigating a complaint under Subsection (e) that there is reason to believe that a nurse's deficiency in care was the result of a factor beyond the nurse's control, the board shall report that determination to the patient safety committee at the facility where the nurse's deficiency in care occurred, or if the facility does not have a patient safety committee, to the chief nursing officer.
    
    (h)  Except as provided by Subsection (i), if the board determines under Subsection (e) that an act by an advanced practice registered nurse falls below an acceptable standard of care, the board shall refer the complaint for review by an expert reviewer appointed under Subsection (b-1) who practices in the same advanced practice role and population focus as the nurse who is the subject of the complaint.
    
    (i)  The board may not refer a complaint against an advanced practice registered nurse to an expert reviewer under Subsection (h) if the act alleged in the complaint is:
    
    (1)  within the scope of practice applicable to a nurse who is not an advanced practice registered nurse; or
    
    (2)  considered unprofessional conduct.

    (2)  be specific enough to enable a person of common understanding to know what is meant by the formal charge;  and
    
    (3)  contain a degree of certainty that gives the person who is the subject of the formal charge notice of each particular act alleged to violate a specific statute, board rule, or board order.
