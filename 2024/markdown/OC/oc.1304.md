    Sec. 1304.151.  FINANCIAL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS; DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS HELD IN TRUST.  (a)  To ensure the faithful performance of a provider's obligations to its service contract holders, each provider must:
    
    (1)  insure the provider's service contracts under a reimbursement insurance policy issued by an insurer authorized to transact insurance in this state or by a surplus lines insurer eligible to place coverage in this state under Chapter [981](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=981), Insurance Code;
    
    (2)  maintain a funded reserve account covering the provider's obligations under its service contracts that are issued and outstanding in this state and place in trust with the executive director a financial security deposit consisting of:

    (3)  maintain, or have a parent company that maintains, a net worth or stockholders' equity of at least $100 million.
    
    (b)  If the provider ensures its obligations under Subsection (a)(2), the amount maintained in the reserve account may not be less than an amount computed by subtracting the amount of any claims paid from the product of 40 percent and the gross consideration the provider received from consumers from the sale of all service contracts issued and outstanding in this state.  The department shall prescribe a calculation form to be used by a provider to calculate the minimum amount required to be maintained in the provider's reserve account under this subsection. The executive director may review and examine the reserve account.  Except as provided by Subsections (b-1) and (b-4), the amount of the security deposit may not be less than $250,000.  The provider must submit to the executive director on request a copy of the provider's financial statements that must be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, be without qualification as to the going concern status of the provider, and be audited by an independent certified public accountant.  The commission by rule may require the provider to submit additional financial reports.
    
    (b-1)  Subject to Subsection (b-2), the amount of the security deposit required under Subsection (b) may not be less than $25,000 if the provider:
    
    (1)  is a motor vehicle dealer licensed under Chapter [2301](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=2301); and
    
    (2)  offers to sell service contracts only on motor vehicles sold by the provider.
    
    (b-2)  The amount of the security deposit required under Subsection (b-1) is:
    
    (1)  $25,000 for a motor vehicle dealer that generated $1,125,000 or less in annual gross revenue in this state from the sale of service contracts in the preceding year;
    
    (2)  $50,000 for a motor vehicle dealer that generated more than $1,125,000 and not more than $2,500,000 in annual gross revenue in this state from the sale of service contracts in the preceding year; and
    
    (3)  $75,000 for a motor vehicle dealer that generated more than $2,500,000 in annual gross revenue in this state from the sale of service contracts in the preceding year.
    
    (b-3)  If a motor vehicle dealer described by Subsection (b-1) has no gross revenue in this state from the sale of service contracts in the preceding year, the security deposit shall be $25,000.
    
    (b-4)  The amount of the security deposit required under Subsection (b) may not be less than $25,000 for a provider of a residential service contract.
    
    (c)  If the provider ensures its obligations under Subsection (a)(3), the provider must give to the executive director on request:
    
    (1)  a copy of the provider's or the provider's parent company's most recent Form 10-K or Form 20-F filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission within the preceding calendar year;  or
    
    (2)  if the provider or the provider's parent company does not file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, a copy of the provider's or the provider's parent company's audited financial statements showing a net worth of the provider or its parent company of at least $100 million.
    
    (d)  If the provider's parent company's Form 10-K, Form 20-F, or audited financial statements are filed to show that the provider meets the financial security requirement, the parent company shall agree to guarantee the obligations of the provider relating to service contracts sold by the provider in this state.
    
    (e)  The executive director may not require a provider to meet any additional financial security requirement.
    
    (f)  In the event of a provider's bankruptcy or a similar event affecting the ability of the provider to faithfully perform its obligations to its service contract holders, the executive director may distribute any funds held in trust as financial security for the provider under this section to eligible service contract holders as payment for claims.  The executive director must distribute the funds in an equitable and cost-effective manner as determined by the executive director.

    Sec. 1304.152.  REIMBURSEMENT INSURANCE POLICY.  (a)  A reimbursement insurance policy that a provider uses to comply with Sections [1304.1025](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=1304.1025) and [1304.151](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=1304.151)(a)(1) must state that:

    (A)  reimburse or pay on behalf of the provider any covered amount the provider is legally obligated to pay; or
    
    (B)  provide the service that the provider is legally obligated to perform according to the provider's contractual obligations under the insured service contract;
    
    (2)  if the covered service is not provided to a service contract holder not later than the 60th day after the date of proof of loss, the insurer shall pay the covered amount directly to the service contract holder or provide the required service; and
    
    (3)  if a refund is not paid to the service contract holder or credited to the service contract holder's account as required by Section 1304.158, the insurer, after receiving written notice, shall pay the refund amount directly to the service contract holder.
    
    (a-1)  For a reimbursement insurance policy to comply with Section [1304.151](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=1304.151)(a)(1), the insurer issuing the policy must:
    
    (1)  maintain surplus as to policyholders and paid-in capital of at least $15 million and annually file with the executive director copies of the insurer's audited financial statements, National Association of Insurance Commissioners annual statement, and actuarial certification if the certification is required and filed in the insurer's state of domicile; or
    
    (2)  maintain surplus as to policyholders and paid-in capital of at least $10 million but not more than $15 million, demonstrate to the satisfaction of the executive director that the insurer maintains a ratio of net written premiums, wherever written, to surplus as to policyholders and paid-in capital of not more than three to one, and annually file with the executive director copies of the insurer's audited financial statements, National Association of Insurance Commissioners annual statement, and actuarial certification if the certification is required and filed in the insurer's state of domicile.
    
    (b)  The insurer may not cancel the reimbursement insurance policy until the insurer delivers to the provider and the executive director a written notice of cancellation that complies with the notice requirements prescribed by Subchapters [B](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=551.051) and C, Chapter [551](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=IN&Value=551), Insurance Code, for cancellation of an insurance policy under those subchapters.   Cancellation of the policy does not affect the insurer's liability for a service contract issued by the provider and insured under the policy before the effective date of the cancellation.
    
    (b-1)  If the insurer or provider cancels the reimbursement insurance policy, the provider named on the policy may not issue a new service contract after the effective date of the cancellation unless:

    (2)  the provider complies with other financial security requirements provided by Section [1304.151](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=1304.151)(a).
    
    (c)  A provider is considered the agent of an insurer that issues a reimbursement insurance policy for purposes of obligating the insurer to the service contract holder in accordance with the service contract and this chapter.  The insurer issuing the reimbursement insurance policy is considered to have received the premium for the policy on the date the service contract holder pays the purchase price of the service contract.
    
    (d)  This chapter does not prevent or limit the right of the insurer to seek indemnification or subrogation against a provider for any amount the insurer pays or is obligated to pay to a service contract holder on behalf of the provider.
    
    (e)  In this section, "net written premiums" means the sum of direct written premiums and assumed reinsurance premiums, minus ceded reinsurance premiums.
