    (2)  a hearing before the disciplinary panel concerning the temporary suspension or restriction is scheduled for the earliest possible date following the suspension or restriction.
    
    (d)  Notwithstanding Chapter [551](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=551), Government Code, the disciplinary panel may hold a meeting by telephone conference call if immediate action is required and convening of the panel at one location is inconvenient for any member of the disciplinary panel.
    
    (e)  After the hearing described by Subsection (c)(2), if the disciplinary panel affirms the temporary suspension or restriction of the license holder's license, the board shall schedule an informal settlement conference that meets the requirements of Section [2001.054](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001.054)(c), Government Code, to be held as soon as practicable, unless the license holder waives the informal settlement conference or an informal settlement conference has already been held with regard to the issues that are the basis for the temporary suspension or restriction.
    
    (f)  If the license holder is unable to show compliance at the informal settlement conference regarding the issues that are the basis for the temporary suspension or restriction, a board representative shall file a charge under Section [351.503](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&Value=351.503) as soon as practicable.
    
    (g)  If after the hearing described by Subsection (c)(2) the disciplinary panel does not temporarily suspend or restrict the license holder's license, the facts that were the basis for the temporary suspension or restriction may not be the sole basis for another proceeding to temporarily suspend or restrict the license holder's license.  The board may use those same facts in a subsequent investigation to obtain new information that may be the basis for the temporary suspension or restriction of the license holder's license.  For purposes of this subsection, facts that are the basis for the temporary suspension or restriction of a license holder's license include facts presented to the disciplinary panel and facts presented by the board or a representative of the board at the time evidence was presented to the disciplinary panel.
