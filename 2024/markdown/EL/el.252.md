    Sec. 252.0011.  INELIGIBILITY FOR APPOINTMENT AS CAMPAIGN TREASURER.  (a)   Except as provided by Subsection (b) or (c), a person is ineligible for appointment as a campaign treasurer if the person is the campaign treasurer of a political committee that does not file a report required by Chapter [254](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=EL&Value=254).
    
    (b)  The period for which a person is ineligible under Subsection (a) for appointment as a campaign treasurer ends on the date on which the political committee in connection with which the person's ineligibility arose has filed each report required by Chapter [254](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=EL&Value=254) that was not timely filed or has paid all fines and penalties in connection with the failure to file the report.

(a)  In addition to the information required by Section [252.002](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=EL&Value=252.002), a campaign treasurer appointment by a general-purpose committee must include:
    
    (1)  the full name, and any acronym of the name that will be used in the name of the committee as provided by Subsection (d), of each corporation, labor organization, or other association or legal entity that directly establishes, administers, or controls the committee, if applicable, or the name of each person who determines to whom the committee makes contributions or the name of each person who determines for what purposes the committee makes expenditures;
    
    (2)  the full name and address of each general-purpose committee to whom the committee intends to make political contributions;
    
    (3)  the name of the committee and, if the name is an acronym, the words the acronym represents; and
    
    (4)  before the committee may use a political contribution from a corporation or a labor organization to make a direct campaign expenditure in connection with a campaign for an elective office, an affidavit stating that:
    
    (A)  the committee is not established or controlled by a candidate or an officeholder; and
    
    (B)  the committee will not use any political contribution from a corporation or a labor organization to make a political contribution to:
    
    (i)  a candidate for elective office;
    
    (ii)  an officeholder; or
    
    (iii)  a political committee that has not filed an affidavit under this subdivision or Section [252.0031](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=EL&Value=252.0031)(a)(2).

The campaign treasurer of the political committee must file a name change with the commission not later than the 14th day after the date of notification.  A campaign treasurer who fails to file a name change as provided by this subsection or a political committee that continues to use a prohibited name after its campaign treasurer has been notified by the commission commits an offense.  An offense under this subsection is a Class B misdemeanor.
    
    (d)  The name of a general-purpose committee must include the name of each corporation, labor organization, or other association or legal entity other than an individual that directly establishes, administers, or controls the committee.  The name of an entity that is required to be included in the name of the committee may be a commonly recognized acronym by which the entity is known.
