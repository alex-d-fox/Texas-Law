If the statement cannot be obtained, the recount supervisor shall have the ballots recounted manually.
    
    (e)  If a recount using a corrected program is to be made, the original program shall be preserved without change and a complete new program shall be prepared.

    (g)  The costs of a recount under Subsection (c) may not be assessed against a person regardless of its outcome.  If other precincts are included in the same recount document, the assessment of the costs in the other precincts shall be determined by the overall outcome in all precincts included in the document.

    (b)  A person desiring a manual recount under this section must notify the recount supervisor immediately after the test is concluded that a manual recount is desired.
    
    (c)  After being notified under Subsection (b) that a manual recount is desired, the recount supervisor shall promptly deliver to the person requesting the recount a written statement of the costs incurred for use of the equipment in making the tests and for compensation of the recount committee for time spent in making the tests.
    
    (d)  To obtain a manual recount, the person requesting the recount must deliver to the recount supervisor within 24 hours after receiving the cost statement under Subsection (c):

    (g)  If the recount supervisor is not the recount coordinator, the supervisor shall notify the coordinator of the change in the counting method and shall deliver to the coordinator the check remitted under Subsection (d)(2).  The check is subject to disposition in the same manner as the check accompanying the recount document.

If the original ballot was duplicated improperly, the recount committee chair shall have the original ballot duplicated properly and that duplicate ballot shall be counted.  The improper duplicate ballot shall be retained and the recount committee chair shall make a notation on the improper duplicate ballot of the reason for which it was not counted.
