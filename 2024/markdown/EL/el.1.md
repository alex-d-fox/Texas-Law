    (b)  When a provision of this code provides that it supersedes another specifically referenced provision of this code to the extent of any conflict, no conflict is created by the failure of the superseding provision, or of related provisions, to repeat the substance of the referenced provision;  rather, a conflict exists only if the substance of the superseding and any related provisions is irreconcilable with the substance of the referenced provision.
