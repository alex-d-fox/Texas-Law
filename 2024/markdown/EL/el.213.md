    (1)  the petitioner and each person entitled to notice under Section [212.032](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=EL&Value=212.032), for an initial recount or an expedited recount;  and

    Sec. 213.057.  CANVASS FOLLOWING RECOUNT.  As soon as practicable after completion of a recount that changes the number of votes received for a particular candidate or for or against a measure, the final canvassing authority shall conduct a canvass for the office or measure involved using the recount supervisor's report, instead of the original county election returns, for each county in which a recount was conducted.  An original final canvass for the office or measure is void, and the new final canvass is the official final canvass for the election on that office or measure.  If no change occurs in the recount in the number of votes received for a candidate or for or against a measure, the official result of the election is determined from the original final canvass.

    (b)  If an objection is made under Subsection (a), the recount coordinator shall ascertain the grounds for the objection and shall verify with the appropriate recount supervisor each result to which objection is made.  If the verification changes the overall result as originally determined by the coordinator, the coordinator shall give notice of the change to the persons entitled to receive the original notice of the result and shall continue the verification process until no objection exists.  The canvass may then be conducted on the basis of telephone or telegraph reports as verified.
    
    (c)  If a canvass is conducted on the basis of results reported by telephone or telegraph, on receiving a recount supervisor's written report, the recount coordinator shall compare the report with the result used in the canvass.  If a discrepancy exists, the coordinator shall ascertain the correct vote count from the supervisor.  The supervisor shall deliver a corrected written report to the coordinator if the original written report is incorrect.
    
    (d)  If a discrepancy that affects the outcome of the election is discovered in the comparison made under Subsection (c), the recount coordinator shall immediately call a meeting of the canvassing authority or notify the governor, as applicable, to conduct another canvass and shall take the necessary action for correction of the ballots for the runoff election.  If discovered discrepancies do not affect the outcome, the coordinator shall correct the canvassing authority's vote tabulation to conform to the written reports.
