    (1)  for a recount under Title 13, including a recount of ballots cast on a system involving direct recording electronic voting machines;
    
    (2)  for an election contest under Title 14; or
    
    (3)  if a risk-limiting audit conducted under Section [127.302](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=EL&Value=127.302) fails to produce strong evidence that the reported outcome of the election matches the results that a full counting of the paper records would reveal.
    
    (e)  An authority that purchased a voting system other than an auditable voting system after September 1, 2014, and before September 1, 2021, may use available federal funding and, if federal funding is not available, available state funding to convert the purchased voting system into an auditable voting system in accordance with the following schedule:
