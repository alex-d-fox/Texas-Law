    (e)  If, before completing an estimate, the estimating authority determines that the total estimated vote will be large enough to make a computation of the number of signatures required to appear on the petition unnecessary, the authority may certify that fact in writing instead of completing the estimate.
    
    (f)  A candidate for an office that is affected by an estimate or by a determination made under Subsection (e) may challenge the accuracy of the estimate or determination by filing a petition, stating the ground of the challenge, in a district court having general jurisdiction in the territory involved.
