    (A)  the signer's printed name;
    
    (B)  the signer's:
    
    (i)  date of birth; or
    
    (ii)  voter registration number and, if the territory from which signatures must be obtained is situated in more than one county, the county of registration;
    
    (C)  the signer's residence address; and
    
    (D)  the date of signing; and
    
    (2)  comply with any other applicable requirements prescribed by law.
    
    (b)  The signature is the only information that is required to appear on the petition in the signer's own handwriting.
    
    (c)  The use of ditto marks or abbreviations does not invalidate a signature if the required information is reasonably ascertainable.
    
    (d)  The omission of the state from the signer's residence address does not invalidate a signature unless the political subdivision from which the signature is obtained is situated in more than one state.  The omission of the zip code from the address does not invalidate a signature.
    
    (e)  A petition signature is invalid if the signer signed the petition earlier than the 180th day before the date the petition is filed.

    (b)  A withdrawal affidavit filed by mail is considered to be filed at the time of its receipt by the appropriate authority.

    (b)  The signature of a voter whose name appears on the list of registered voters with the notation "S", or a similar notation, is considered valid if the voter:
    
    (1)  is otherwise eligible to vote in the territory; and
    
    (2)  provides a residence address located in the territory.

    Sec. 277.003.  VERIFYING SIGNATURES BY STATISTICAL SAMPLE.  If a petition contains more than 1,000 signatures, the city secretary or other authority responsible for verifying the signatures may use any reasonable statistical sampling method in determining whether the petition contains the required number of valid signatures, except that the sample may not be less than 25 percent of the total number of signatures appearing on the petition or 1,000, whichever is greater.  If the signatures on a petition circulated on a statewide basis are to be verified by the secretary of state, the sample prescribed by Section [141.069](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=EL&Value=141.069) applies to the petition rather than the sample prescribed by this section.
