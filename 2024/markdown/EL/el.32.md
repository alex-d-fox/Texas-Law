    Sec. 32.001.  PRESIDING JUDGE AND ALTERNATE FOR EACH ELECTION PRECINCT.  (a)  A presiding election judge and an alternate presiding judge shall be appointed for each election precinct in which an election is held.
    
    (b)  The alternate presiding judge shall serve as presiding judge for an election if the regularly appointed presiding judge cannot serve.
    
    
    
    
    Acts 1985, 69th Leg., ch. 211, Sec. 1, eff. Jan. 1, 1986.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sec. 32.002.  JUDGES FOR COUNTY ELECTION.  (a)  The commissioners court shall appoint the election judges for each regular county election precinct:
    
    (1)  at its July term in a county with a population of over 500,000; or
    
    (2)  at its August term in a county with a population of 500,000 or less.
    
    (b)  Judges appointed under Subsection (a) serve for a term of one year, except that the commissioners court by order recorded in its minutes may provide for a term of two years.  A judge's term begins:
    
    (1)  August 1 following appointment in a county to which Subsection (a)(1) applies; or
    
    (2)  September 1 following appointment in a county to which Subsection (a)(2) applies.
    
    (c)  The presiding judge and alternate presiding judge must be affiliated or aligned with different political parties, subject to this subsection.  Before July of each year in a county to which Subsection (a)(1) applies or before August of each year in a county to which Subsection (a)(2) applies, the county chair of a political party whose candidate for governor received the highest or second highest number of votes in the county in the most recent gubernatorial general election shall submit in writing to the commissioners court a list of names of persons in order of preference for each precinct who are eligible for appointment as an election judge.  The county chair may supplement the list of names of persons until the 20th day before a general election or the 15th day before a special election in case an appointed election judge becomes unable to serve.  The commissioners court shall appoint the first person meeting the applicable eligibility requirements from the list submitted in compliance with this subsection by the party with the highest number of votes in the precinct as the presiding judge and the first person meeting the applicable eligibility requirements from the list submitted in compliance with this subsection by the party with the second highest number of votes in the precinct as the alternate presiding judge. If the candidates for governor of two political parties received the same number of votes in the precinct, the first person meeting the applicable eligibility requirements from the list submitted by the party whose candidate for governor received the highest number of votes in the county shall be appointed as the presiding judge and the first person meeting the applicable eligibility requirements from the list submitted by the party whose candidate for governor received the second highest number of votes in the county shall be appointed as the alternate presiding judge.  The commissioners court may reject the list if the persons whose names are submitted on the list are determined not to meet the applicable eligibility requirements.
    
    (c-1)  For purposes of this subsection, the county chair shall provide a list of names of persons eligible for appointment as election judges.  Judges of countywide polling places established under Section [43.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=EL&Value=43.007) must be appointed from the list of names of persons submitted by the county chair in compliance with Subsection (c) except that in appointing a person from the list the commissioners court shall apportion the number of judges in direct proportion to the percentage of precincts located in each county commissioners precinct won by each party in the last gubernatorial election, the commissioners court is not required to make the appointments based on specific polling locations or precincts, a presiding judge or alternate presiding judge is not required to serve in a polling place located in the precinct in which the judge resides, and more than one presiding judge or alternate presiding judge may be selected from the same precinct to serve in polling places not located in the precinct in which the judges reside.  The county chairs may submit, and the commissioners court may preapprove, the appointment of more presiding judges or alternate presiding judges than necessary to fill available positions.  The county clerk may select an individual whose appointment was preapproved by the commissioners court to fill a vacancy in a position that was held by an individual from the same political party.  Other than a judge's party affiliation, nothing in this subsection precludes a county clerk from placing an election officer at a countywide polling place based on the need for services at that location.
    
    (d)  The county clerk, after making a reasonable effort to consult with the party chair of the appropriate political party or parties, shall submit to the commissioners court a list of names of persons eligible for appointment as presiding judge and alternate presiding judge for each precinct in which an appointment is not made under Subsection (c).  The commissioners court shall appoint an eligible person from the list who is affiliated or aligned with the appropriate party, if available.
    
    (e)  The commissioners court shall fill a vacancy in the position of presiding judge or alternate presiding judge for the remainder of the unexpired term.  An appointment to fill a vacancy may be made at any regular or special term of court.  Not later than 48 hours after the county clerk becomes aware of a vacancy, the county clerk shall notify the county chair of the same political party with which the original judge was affiliated or aligned of the vacancy.  Not later than the fifth day after the date of notification of the vacancy, the county chair of the same political party with which the original judge was affiliated or aligned shall submit to the commissioners court in writing the name of a person who is eligible for the appointment.  If a name is submitted in compliance with this subsection, the commissioners court shall appoint that person to the unexpired term.  If a name is not submitted in compliance with this subsection, the county clerk shall submit to the commissioners court a list of names of persons eligible as an appointee for the unexpired term.  The commissioners court shall appoint an eligible person from the list who is affiliated or aligned with the same party, if available.
    
    (f)  Subject to Section [32.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=EL&Value=32.003), the judges appointed under this section shall serve in each election ordered by the governor or a county authority in which the regular county election precincts are required to be used.
    
    (g)  Following an oral warning to the election judge and with the concurrence of the county chair of the same political party with which the judge is affiliated or aligned, the county clerk may remove, replace, or reassign an election judge who causes a disruption in a polling location or wilfully disobeys the provisions of this code.  A vacancy created under this subsection shall be filled in the same manner as an emergency appointment under Section [32.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=EL&Value=32.007).
