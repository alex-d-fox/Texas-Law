    Sec. 87.027.  SIGNATURE VERIFICATION COMMITTEE.  (a)  Except as provided by Subsection (a-1), a signature verification committee may be appointed in any election.  The early voting clerk is the authority responsible for determining whether a signature verification committee is to be appointed.  If the clerk determines that a committee is to be appointed, the clerk shall issue a written order calling for the appointment.
    
    (a-1)  A signature verification committee shall be appointed in the general election for state and county officers on submission to the early voting clerk of a written request for the committee by at least 15 registered voters of the county.  The request must be submitted not later than the preceding October 1, and a request submitted by mail is considered to be submitted at the time of its receipt by the clerk.
    
    (b)  The following authority is responsible for appointing the members of a signature verification committee:
    
    (1)  the county election board, in an election for which the board is established;
    
    (2)  the county chair, in a primary election;  and
    
    (3)  the governing body of the political subdivision, in an election ordered by an authority of a political subdivision other than a county.
    
    (c)  Not later than the fifth day after the date the early voting clerk issues the order calling for the appointment of a signature verification committee, or not later than October 15 for a committee required under Subsection (a-1), the appropriate authority shall appoint the members of the committee and designate one of the appointees as chair, subject to Subsection (d).  The authority shall fill a vacancy on the committee by appointment as soon as possible after the vacancy occurs, subject to Subsection (d).  The early voting clerk shall post notice of the name and residence address of each appointee.  The notice must remain posted continuously for the period beginning the day after the date of the appointment and ending on the last day of the committee's operation in the election.
    
    (d)  The early voting clerk shall determine the number of members who are to compose the signature verification committee and shall state that number in the order calling for the committee's appointment.  A committee must consist of not fewer than five members.  In an election in which party alignment is indicated on the ballot, each county chair of a political party with a nominee or aligned candidate on the ballot shall submit to the appointing authority a list of names of persons eligible to serve on the signature verification committee in order of the  county chair's preference.  The authority shall appoint at least two persons from each list in the order of preference indicated on each list to serve as members of the committee.  The same number of members must be appointed from each list.  The authority shall appoint as chair of the committee the highest-ranked person on the list provided by the political party whose nominee for governor received the most votes in the county in the most recent gubernatorial general election.  The authority shall appoint as vice chair of the committee the highest-ranked person on the list provided by the political party whose nominee for governor received the second most votes in the county in the most recent gubernatorial general election. A vacancy on the committee shall be filled by appointment from the original list or from a new list submitted by the appropriate county chair.
    
    (e)  To be eligible to serve on a signature verification committee, a person must be eligible under Subchapter [C](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=EL&Value=32.051), Chapter [32](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=EL&Value=32), for service as a presiding election judge, except that the person must be a qualified voter:
    
    (1)  of the county, in a countywide election ordered by the governor or a county authority or in a primary election;
    
    (2)  of the part of the county in which the election is held, for an election ordered by the governor or a county authority that does not cover the entire county of the person's residence; or
    
    (3)  of the political subdivision, in an election ordered by an authority of a political subdivision other than a county.
    
    (f)  The early voting clerk shall determine the place, day or days, and hours of operation of the signature verification committee and shall state that information in the order calling for the committee's appointment.  A committee may not begin operating before the 20th day before election day.
    
    (g)  The early voting clerk shall post a copy of the order calling for the appointment of the signature verification committee.  The copy must remain posted continuously for at least 10 days before the first day the committee meets.
    
    (h)  If a signature verification committee is appointed for the election, the early voting clerk shall deliver the jacket envelopes containing the early voting ballots voted by mail to the committee instead of to the early voting ballot board.  Deliveries may be made only during the period of the committee's operation at times scheduled in advance of delivery by the early voting clerk.  The clerk shall post notice of the time of each delivery.  The notice must remain posted continuously for at least two days before the date of the delivery.
    
    (i)  The signature verification committee shall compare the signature on each carrier envelope certificate, except those signed for a voter by a witness, with the signature on the voter's ballot application to determine whether the signatures are those of the voter.  The committee may also compare the signatures with any known signature of the voter on file with the county clerk or voter registrar to determine whether the signatures are those of the voter.  Except as provided by Subsection (l), a determination under this subsection that the signatures are not those of the voter must be made by a majority vote of the committee's membership.  The committee shall place the jacket envelopes, carrier envelopes, and applications of voters whose signatures are not those of the voter in separate containers from those of voters whose signatures are those of the voter.  The committee chair shall deliver the sorted materials to the early voting ballot board at the time specified by the board's presiding judge.
    
    (j)  If a signature verification committee is appointed, the early voting ballot board shall follow the same procedure for accepting the early voting ballots voted by mail as in an election without a signature verification committee, except that the board may not determine whether a voter's signatures on the carrier envelope certificate and ballot application are those of the same person if the committee has determined that the signatures are those of the same person. If the committee has determined that the signatures are not those of the same person, the board may make a determination that the signatures are those of the same person by a majority vote of the board's membership.
    
    (k)  Postings required by this section shall be made on the bulletin board used for posting notice of meetings of the commissioners court of a county that does not maintain an Internet website, in an election for which the county election board is established or a primary election, or of the governing body of the political subdivision in other elections.
    
    (k-1)  If the county maintains an Internet website, postings required by this section shall be made on the county's Internet website in an election for which the county election board is established or a primary election.
    
    (l)  If more than 12 members are appointed to serve on the signature verification committee, the early voting clerk may designate two or more subcommittees of not less than six members.  If subcommittees have been designated, a determination under Subsection (i) is made by a majority of the subcommittee.
    
    (m)  If ballot materials or ballot applications are recorded electronically as provided by Section [87.126](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=EL&Value=87.126), the signature verification committee may use an electronic copy of a carrier envelope certificate or the voter's ballot application in making the comparison under Subsection (i).

    SUBCHAPTER C. ACCEPTING EARLY VOTING BALLOT VOTED BY MAIL
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 87.041.  ACCEPTING VOTER.  (a)  The early voting ballot board shall open each jacket envelope for an early voting ballot voted by mail and determine whether to accept the voter's ballot.
    
    (b)  A ballot may be accepted only if:
    
    (1)  the carrier envelope certificate is properly executed;
    
    (2)  neither the voter's signature on the ballot application nor the signature on the carrier envelope certificate is determined to have been executed by a person other than the voter, unless signed by a witness;
    
    (3)  the voter's ballot application states a legal ground for early voting by mail;
    
    (4)  the voter is registered to vote, if registration is required by law;
    
    (5)  the address to which the ballot was mailed to the voter, as indicated by the application, was outside the voter's county of residence, if the ground for early voting is absence from the county of residence;
    
    (6)  for a voter to whom a statement of residence form was required to be sent under Section [86.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=EL&Value=86.002)(a), the statement of residence is returned in the carrier envelope and indicates that the voter satisfies the residence requirements prescribed by Section [63.0011](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=EL&Value=63.0011);
    
    (7)  the address to which the ballot was mailed to the voter is an address that is otherwise required by Sections [84.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=EL&Value=84.002) and [86.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=EL&Value=86.003); and
    
    (8)  the information required under Section [86.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=EL&Value=86.002)(g) provided by the voter identifies the same voter identified on the voter's application for voter registration under Section [13.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=EL&Value=13.002)(c)(8).
    
    (c)  If a ballot is accepted, the board shall enter the voter's name on the poll list unless the form of the list makes it impracticable to do so.  The names of the voters casting ballots by mail shall be listed separately on the poll list from those casting ballots by personal appearance.
    
    (d)  A ballot shall be rejected if any requirement prescribed by Subsection (b) is not satisfied.  In that case, the board shall indicate the rejection by entering "rejected" on the carrier envelope and on the corresponding jacket envelope.
    
    (d-1)  If a voter provides the information required under Section [86.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=EL&Value=86.002)(g) and it identifies the same voter identified on the voter's application for voter registration under Section [13.002](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=EL&Value=13.002)(c)(8), the signature on the ballot application and on the carrier envelope certificate shall be rebuttably presumed to be the signatures of the voter.  The board shall compare signatures in making a determination under Subsection (b)(2) regardless of whether the presumption provided by this subsection exists.
    
    (e)  In making the determination under Subsection (b)(2), to determine whether the signatures are those of the voter, the board may also compare the signatures with any known signature of the voter on file with the county clerk or voter registrar.
    
    (f)  In making the determination under Subsection (b)(2) for a ballot cast under Chapter [101](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=EL&Value=101) or [105](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=EL&Value=105), the board shall compare the signature on the carrier envelope or signature cover sheet with the signature of the voter on the federal postcard application.
    
    (g)  A person commits an offense if the person intentionally accepts a ballot for voting or causes a ballot to be accepted for voting that the person knows does not meet the requirements of Subsection (b).  An offense under this subsection is a Class A misdemeanor.
