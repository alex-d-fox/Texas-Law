    (1)  describes the property to be rented; and
    
    (2)  states whether the property will be rented at public auction or privately, whether for cash or on credit, and if on credit, the extent of the credit and the period for which the property may be rented.

    (2)  by order approve and confirm the rental if the court finds the rental just and reasonable.
    
    (b)  If the court disapproves the rental, the guardianship is not bound and the court may order another offering for rent of the property in the same manner and subject to the provisions of this chapter.
    
    (c)  If the court approves the rental and it later appears that, by reason of the fault of the guardian of the estate, the property was not rented for the property's reasonable value, the court shall have the guardian and the sureties on the guardian's bond appear and show cause why the reasonable value of the rental of the property should not be adjudged against the guardian or sureties.
