The guardian shall be given notice by a qualified delivery method to appear and contest the request for removal under this subsection at a time and place set in the notice.
    
    (c)  If there is probable cause to believe that a guardian is an incapacitated person, a court may, on the court's own motion or on complaint of an interested person, appoint an attorney ad litem to represent the ward's interests as provided by Section [1054.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ES&Value=1054.007) and a court investigator or guardian ad litem to investigate whether the guardian should be removed under Subsection (a)(5)(A).
