    (6)  gas obtained from other sources or another tract of land may be injected into a formation underlying any land or lease committed to the agreement, and that royalties are not required to be paid on the gas injected when the gas is produced from the unit.

(a)  The court shall enter an order setting out the court's findings and authorizing execution of the proposed pooling or unitization agreement, with or without payment of cash consideration according to the agreement, if the court finds that:
    
    (1)  the pool or unit to which the agreement relates will be operated in a manner that protects correlative rights or prevents the physical or economic waste of oil, liquid hydrocarbons, gas, gaseous elements, or other minerals subject to the pool or unit;
    
    (2)  it is in the best interests of the estate that the agreement be executed; and
    
    (3)  the agreement conforms substantially with the permissible provisions of Section [1160.151](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ES&Value=1160.151).
    
    (b)  If cash consideration is to be paid for the pooling or unitization agreement, the court shall make a finding as to the necessity of increased or additional bond as a finding is made in the making of leases on payment of the cash bonus for the lease.  The agreement is not valid until any required increased or additional bond has been approved by the judge and filed with the clerk.
    
    (c)  If the effective date of the pooling or unitization agreement is not stipulated in the agreement, the effective date of the agreement is the date of the court's order.
