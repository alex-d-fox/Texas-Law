    (c)  An heir who is not disclosed in an affidavit recorded under this section may recover from an heir who receives consideration from a purchaser in a transfer for value of title to a homestead passing under the affidavit.

    (b)  The distributees to whom payment, delivery, transfer, or issuance is made are:
    
    (1)  answerable for the payment, delivery, transfer, or issuance to any person having a prior right; and
