    Sec. 402.053.  PROTECTION OF PERSON PURCHASING ESTATE PROPERTY.  (a)  A person who is not a devisee or heir is not required to inquire into the power of sale of estate property of the independent executor or independent administrator or the propriety of the exercise of the power of sale if the person deals with the independent executor or independent administrator in good faith and:
    
    (1)  a power of sale is granted to the independent executor in the will;
    
    (2)  a power of sale is granted under Section [401.006](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ES&Value=401.006) in the court order appointing the independent executor or independent administrator; or

The signature or joinder of a devisee or heir who has an interest in the property being sold as described in this section is not necessary for the purchaser to obtain all right, title, and interest of the estate in the property being sold.
    
    (c)  This subchapter does not relieve the independent executor or independent administrator from any duty owed to a devisee or heir in relation, directly or indirectly, to the sale.
