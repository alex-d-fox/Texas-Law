    (b)  If the court refers to mediation a proceeding under Subsection (a) regarding the appointment of a guardian for a proposed ward:
    
    (1)  a determination of incapacity of the proposed ward may be an issue to be mediated, but the applicant for guardianship must still prove to the court that the proposed ward is an incapacitated person in accordance with the requirements of Chapter [1101](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ES&Value=1101); and
