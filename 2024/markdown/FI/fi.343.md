    INSURANCE NOTICE TO APPLICANT
    
      
    
    
    You may elect to purchase credit life, disability, or involuntary unemployment insurance in conjunction with this mortgage loan.  If you elect to purchase this insurance coverage, you may pay for it either on a monthly premium basis or with a single premium payment at the time the lender closes this loan.  If you choose the single premium payment, the cost of the premium will be financed at the interest rate provided for in the mortgage loan.
    
    This insurance is NOT required as a condition of closing the mortgage loan and will be included with the loan only at your request.
    
    You have the right to cancel this credit insurance once purchased.  If you cancel it within 30 days of the date of your loan, you will receive either a full refund or a credit against your loan account.  If you cancel this insurance at any other time, you will receive either a refund or credit against your loan account of any unearned premium.  YOU MUST CANCEL WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE OF THE LOAN TO RECEIVE A FULL REFUND OR CREDIT.
    
    To assist you in making an informed choice, the following estimates of premiums are being provided along with an example of the cost of financing.  The examples assume that the term of the insurance product is ____ years and that the interest rate is ______ percent (a rate that has recently been available for the type of loan you are seeking). PLEASE NOTE THAT THE ACTUAL LOAN TERMS YOU QUALIFY FOR MAY VARY FROM THIS EXAMPLE. "Total amount paid" is the amount that would be paid if you financed only the total insurance premium for a ___ year period and is equal to the amount you would have paid if you made all scheduled payments.

    (c)  In adopting rules under Subsection (b), the finance commission shall require a mortgage servicer who receives a request for a payoff statement with respect to a home loan from a title insurance company to deliver the requested payoff statement on the prescribed form within a time specified by finance commission rule, which must allow the mortgage servicer at least seven business days after the date the request is received to deliver the payoff statement.

    (1)  remains a liability of the former mortgagor owed to the mortgagee; and
    
    (2)  if the payoff statement is in connection with:
    
    (A)  the sale of the real property:
    
    (i)  the deed of trust or other contract lien securing an interest in the property is released;

    (iii)  any proceeds disbursed at closing to or for the benefit of the mortgagor, excluding closing costs related to the transaction, are subject to a constructive trust for the benefit of the mortgagee to the extent of the underpayment; or
    
    (B)  a refinance by the mortgagor of the existing home loan:
    
    (i)  the lien securing the existing home loan becomes subordinate to the lien securing the new home loan; and
    
    (ii)  any proceeds disbursed at closing to or for the benefit of the mortgagor, excluding closing costs related to the transaction, are subject to a constructive trust for the benefit of the mortgagee to the extent of the underpayment.
