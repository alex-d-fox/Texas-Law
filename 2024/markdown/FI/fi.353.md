    (b)  A retail seller and prospective retail buyer may enter into a conditional delivery agreement.
    
    (c)  A conditional delivery agreement is:
    
    (1)  an enforceable contract; and
    
    (2)  void on the execution of a retail installment contract between the parties to the conditional delivery agreement for the sale of the commercial vehicle that is the subject of the conditional delivery agreement.
    
    (d)  A conditional delivery agreement may only confer rights consistent with this section and may not confer any legal or equitable rights of ownership, including ownership of the commercial vehicle that is the subject of the conditional delivery agreement.
    
    (e)  A conditional delivery agreement may not exceed a term of 15 days.
    
    (f)  If a prospective retail buyer tenders to a retail seller a trade-in motor vehicle in connection with a conditional delivery agreement:
    
    (1)  the parties must agree on the value of the trade-in motor vehicle;
    
    (2)  the conditional delivery agreement must contain the agreed value of the trade-in motor vehicle described by Subdivision (1); and
    
    (3)  the retail seller must use reasonable care to conserve the trade-in motor vehicle while the vehicle is in the retail seller's possession.
    
    (g)  If the parties to a conditional delivery agreement do not subsequently enter into a retail installment contract for the sale of the commercial vehicle that is the subject of the conditional delivery agreement, the retail seller shall, not later than the seventh day after termination of the conditional delivery agreement:
    
    (1)  deliver to the prospective retail buyer any trade-in motor vehicle that the prospective retail buyer tendered in connection with the conditional delivery agreement in the same or substantially the same condition as it was at the time of execution of the agreement and shall return any down payment or other consideration received from the prospective retail buyer in connection with the agreement; or
    
    (2)  if the trade-in motor vehicle cannot be returned in the same or substantially the same condition as it was at the time of execution of the conditional delivery agreement, deliver to the prospective retail buyer a sum of money equal to the agreed value of the trade-in motor vehicle as described by Subsection (f) and shall return any down payment or other consideration described by Subdivision (1).
    
    (h)  Any money that a retail seller is obligated to provide a prospective retail buyer under Subsection (g) must be tendered at the same time that the trade-in motor vehicle is delivered for return to the prospective retail buyer or when the trade-in motor vehicle would have been delivered if the vehicle was damaged or could not be returned.
    
    (i)  If a prospective retail buyer returns a commercial vehicle under a conditional delivery agreement at the request of the retail seller, the retail seller, notwithstanding the period prescribed by Subsection (g), must return the trade-in vehicle at the same time that the commercial vehicle under the conditional delivery agreement is returned by the prospective retail buyer.

If the commissioner determines that the retail seller in fact owes the prospective retail buyer a certain amount under Subsection (g), the commissioner may order the retail seller to pay the amount to the prospective retail buyer.  If the trade-in motor vehicle is not returned by the retail seller in accordance with this section and the retail seller does not pay the prospective retail buyer an amount equal to the agreed value of the trade-in motor vehicle within the period prescribed by this section, the commissioner may assess an administrative penalty against the retail seller in an amount that is reasonable in relation to the value of the trade-in motor vehicle.  The commissioner shall provide notice to the retail seller and the prospective retail buyer of the commissioner's determination under this subsection.
    
    (l)  Not later than the 30th day after the date the parties receive notice of the commissioner's determination under Subsection (k), the retail seller or prospective retail buyer may file with the commissioner an appeal of the commissioner's determination requesting a time and place for a hearing before a hearings officer designated by the commissioner.

    (m)  A person who files an appeal under Subsection (l) is required to pay a deposit to secure the payment of the costs of the hearing in a reasonable amount as determined by the commissioner, unless the person cannot afford to pay the deposit and files an affidavit to that effect with the hearings officer in the form and content prescribed by finance commission rule.  The entire deposit must be refunded to the person if the person prevails at the hearing.  If the person does not prevail, any portion of the deposit in excess of the costs of the hearing assessed against the person is refundable.
    
    (n)  Notice of the commissioner's final order under Subsection (l), given to the person in accordance with Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code, must include a statement of the person's right to judicial review of the order.

    Sec. 353.016.  COMPUTATION OF TIME PRICE DIFFERENTIAL USING TRUE DAILY EARNINGS METHOD.  Under the true daily earnings method, the earned time price differential is computed by multiplying the daily rate of the time price differential by the number of days the actual unpaid principal balance is outstanding.  Under this method:
    
    (1)  a payment is credited at the time received, with a payment received before the scheduled installment date resulting in a greater reduction in the unpaid principal balance than otherwise scheduled, and a payment received after the scheduled installment date resulting in less of a reduction in the unpaid principal balance than otherwise scheduled;
    
    (2)  a partial payment is applied first to time price differential with any remainder applied to the unpaid principal balance; and
    
    (3)  accrued but unpaid time price differential is not:
    
    (A)  added to the unpaid principal balance; or

    (c)  If prepayment in full or demand for payment in full occurs during an installment period, the holder may retain, in addition to time price differential that accrued during any elapsed installment periods, an amount computed by:
    
    (1)  multiplying the simple annual rate under the contract by the unpaid principal balance of the contract determined according to the schedule of payments to be outstanding on the preceding installment due date;
    
    (2)  dividing 365 into the product computed under Subdivision (1); and

    (d)  In addition to the earned time price differential computed under this section, the holder may also earn a $150 acquisition fee for a heavy commercial vehicle, or a $25 acquisition fee for other commercial vehicles, if the sum of the earned time price differential and the acquisition fee does not exceed the time price differential disclosed in the contract.
    
    (e)  The holder shall refund or credit, as applicable, to the retail buyer the amount computed by subtracting the total amount earned or retained under Subsections (b), (c), and (d) from the total amount of time price differential contracted for and precomputed in the contract.
