    Sec. 348.006.  PRINCIPAL BALANCE;  INCLUSION OF DOCUMENTARY FEE.  (a)  The principal balance under a retail installment contract is computed by:
    
    (1)  adding:
    
    (A)  the cash price of the motor vehicle;
    
    (B)  each amount included in the retail installment contract for an itemized charge; and
    
    (C)  subject to Subsection (c), a documentary fee for services rendered for or on behalf of the retail buyer in handling and processing documents relating to the motor vehicle sale; and
    
    (2)  subtracting from the results under Subdivision (1) the amount of the retail buyer's down payment in money, goods, or both.
    
    (b)  The computation of the principal balance may include an amount authorized under Section [348.404](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=348.404)(b).
    
    (c)  For a documentary fee to be included in the principal balance of a retail installment contract:
    
    (1)  the retail seller must charge the documentary fee to cash buyers and credit buyers;
    
    (2)  the documentary fee may not exceed a reasonable amount agreed to by the retail seller and retail buyer for the documentary services; and
    
    (3)  the buyer's order and the retail installment contract must include:
    
    (A)  a statement of the amount of the documentary fee; and
    
    (B)  in reasonable proximity to the place in each where the amount of the documentary fee is disclosed, the following notice in type that is bold-faced, capitalized, underlined, or otherwise conspicuously set out from surrounding written material:
    
    "A DOCUMENTARY FEE IS NOT AN OFFICIAL FEE.  A DOCUMENTARY FEE IS NOT REQUIRED BY LAW, BUT MAY BE CHARGED TO BUYERS FOR HANDLING DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE SALE.  A DOCUMENTARY FEE MAY NOT EXCEED A REASONABLE AMOUNT AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES.  THIS NOTICE IS REQUIRED BY LAW."
    
    (d)  A retail seller shall post the documentary fee notice prescribed in Subsection (c) so that it is clearly visible in each place where a vehicle sale is finalized.  If the language primarily used in an oral sales presentation is not the same as the language in which the retail installment contract is written, the retail seller shall furnish to the retail buyer a written statement containing the notice set out in Subsection (c)(3)(B) in the language primarily used in the oral sales presentation.
    
    (e)  Prior to increasing the maximum amount of the documentary fee the retail seller charges, a retail seller shall provide written notice to the commissioner of the maximum amount of the documentary fee the retail seller intends to charge unless the maximum amount intended to be charged is considered reasonable as provided by Subsection (f).  The commissioner may review the amount of a documentary fee a retail seller intends to charge for reasonableness if the retail seller is required to provide written notice of the fee increase under this subsection.  In determining whether a fee charged by a retail seller is reasonable, the commissioner may consider the resources required by the retail seller to perform the retail seller's duties under state and federal law with respect to the handling and processing of documents relating to the sale and financing of a motor vehicle.  If the commissioner determines that a documentary fee charged is not reasonable, the commissioner may require that the documentary fee charged be reduced or suspended.
    
    (e-1)  Except as provided by Subsections (e-2) and (e-3), the following information and documents are confidential and not subject to disclosure:
    
    (1)  all information provided by a retail seller to the commissioner under Subsection (e), including the maximum documentary fee a retail seller intends to charge, the written notice of an increased documentary fee, and any financial information submitted with the notice; and
    
    (2)  all correspondence between a retail seller and the commissioner or the commissioner's representative relating to the notice of an increased documentary fee under Subsection (e) and a review for reasonableness of the amount of the documentary fee to be charged.
    
    (e-2)  The commissioner may disclose information or documents that are confidential under Subsection (e-1) if:
    
    (1)  the commissioner determines that release of the information or documents is required for an administrative hearing;
    
    (2)  the retail seller consents to the release of the information or documents; or
    
    (3)  the disclosure is required by a court order.
    
    (e-3)  The commissioner or the commissioner's representative may disclose whether a retail seller has filed written notice of an increased documentary fee and the proposed amount of the increased fee to:
    
    (1)  a holder that provides written proof, signed by the retail seller, that the retail seller has agreed to assign or transfer one or more retail installment contracts to the holder; or
    
    (2)  a prospective retail buyer that provides to the commissioner:
    
    (A)  a buyer's order executed by the prospective buyer and the retail seller;
    
    (B)  a draft of a retail installment contract provided by the retail seller to the prospective buyer; or
    
    (C)  a written statement by the retail seller acknowledging that the person is a prospective buyer of a motor vehicle from the retail seller.
    
    (f)  A documentary fee charged in accordance with this section is considered reasonable for purposes of this section if the amount is less than or equal to the amount of the documentary fee presumed reasonable as established by rule of the finance commission.
    
    (g)  This section does not:
    
    (1)  create a private right of action; or
    
    (2)  require that the commissioner approve a specific documentary fee amount before a retail seller charges the fee.
    
    (h)  The finance commission may adopt rules, including rules relating to the standards for a reasonableness determination or disclosures, necessary to enforce this section.  A rule adopted under this subsection may not require a retail seller to submit to the commissioner for prior approval the amount of a documentary fee that the retail seller intends to charge under this section.
    
    (i)  The commissioner has exclusive jurisdiction to enforce this section.

    Sec. 348.013.  CONDITIONAL DELIVERY AGREEMENT.  (a)  In this section, "conditional delivery agreement" means a contract between a retail seller and prospective retail buyer under the terms of which the retail seller allows the prospective retail buyer the use and benefit of a motor vehicle for a specified term.
    
    (b)  Subject to this section, a retail seller and prospective retail buyer may enter into a conditional delivery agreement.
    
    (c)  A conditional delivery agreement is:
    
    (1)  an enforceable contract; and
    
    (2)  void on the execution of a retail installment contract between the parties of the conditional delivery agreement for the sale of the motor vehicle that is the subject of the conditional delivery agreement.
    
    (d)  A conditional delivery agreement may only confer rights consistent with this section and may not confer any legal or equitable rights of ownership, including ownership of the motor vehicle that is the subject of the conditional delivery agreement.
    
    (e)  A conditional delivery agreement may not exceed a term of 15 days.
    
    (f)  If a prospective retail buyer tenders to a retail seller a trade-in motor vehicle in connection with a conditional delivery agreement:
    
    (1)  the parties must agree on the value of the trade-in motor vehicle;
    
    (2)  the conditional delivery agreement must contain the agreed value of the trade-in motor vehicle described by Subdivision (1); and
    
    (3)  the retail seller must use reasonable care to conserve the trade-in motor vehicle while the vehicle is in the retail seller's possession.
    
    (g)  If the parties to a conditional delivery agreement do not subsequently enter into a retail installment contract for the sale of the motor vehicle that is the subject of the conditional delivery agreement, the retail seller shall, not later than the seventh day after termination of the conditional delivery agreement:
    
    (1)  deliver to the prospective retail buyer any trade-in motor vehicle that the prospective retail buyer tendered in connection with the conditional delivery agreement in the same or substantially the same condition as it was at the time of execution of the agreement and shall return any down payment or other consideration received from the prospective retail buyer in connection with the agreement; or
    
    (2)  if the trade-in motor vehicle cannot be returned in the same or substantially the same condition as it was at the time of execution of the conditional delivery agreement, deliver to the prospective retail buyer a sum of money equal to the agreed value of the trade-in motor vehicle as described by Subsection (f) and shall return any down payment or other consideration described by Subdivision (1).
    
    (h)  Any money that a retail seller is obligated to provide a prospective retail buyer under Subsection (g) must be tendered at the same time that the trade-in motor vehicle is delivered for return to the prospective retail buyer or when the trade-in motor vehicle would have been delivered if the vehicle was damaged or could not be returned.
    
    (i)  If a prospective retail buyer returns a motor vehicle under a conditional delivery agreement at the request of the retail seller, the retail seller, notwithstanding the period prescribed by Subsection (g), must return the trade-in vehicle at the same time that the motor vehicle under the conditional delivery agreement is returned by the prospective retail buyer.
    
    (j)  The prospective retail buyer shall return the motor vehicle received under the conditional delivery agreement in the same or substantially the same condition as it was at the time of the execution of the conditional delivery agreement.
    
    (k)  An amount paid or required to be paid by the retail seller under Subsection (g) is subject to review by the commissioner.  If the commissioner determines that the retail seller in fact owes the prospective retail buyer a certain amount under Subsection (g), the commissioner may order the retail seller to pay the amount to the prospective retail buyer.  If the trade-in motor vehicle is not returned by the retail seller in accordance with this section and the retail seller does not pay the prospective retail buyer an amount equal to the agreed value of the trade-in motor vehicle within the period prescribed by this section, the commissioner may assess an administrative penalty against the retail seller in an amount that is reasonable in relation to the value of the trade-in motor vehicle.  The commissioner shall provide notice to the retail seller and the prospective retail buyer of the commissioner's determination under this subsection.
    
    (l)  Not later than the 30th day after the date the parties receive notice of the commissioner's determination under Subsection (k), the retail seller or prospective retail buyer may file with the commissioner an appeal of the commissioner's determination requesting a time and place for a hearing before a hearings officer designated by the commissioner.  A hearing under this subsection is governed by Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code.  After the hearing, based on the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations of the hearings officer, the commissioner shall enter a final order.
    
    (m)  A person who requests an appeal under Subsection (l) is required to pay a deposit to secure the payment of the costs of the hearing in a reasonable amount as determined by the commissioner, unless the person cannot afford to pay the deposit and files an affidavit to that effect with the hearings officer in the form and content prescribed by finance commission rule.  The entire deposit must be refunded to the person if the person prevails in the hearing.  If the person does not prevail, any portion of the deposit in excess of the costs of the hearing assessed against the person is refundable.
    
    (n)  Notice of the commissioner's final order under Subsection (l), given to the person in accordance with Section 2001, Government Code, must include a statement of the person's right to judicial review of the order.
    
    (o)  The hearings officer may order the retail seller or the prospective retail buyer, or both, to pay reasonable expenses incurred by the commissioner in connection with obtaining a final order under Subsection (l), including attorney's fees, investigative costs, and witness fees.
    
    (p)  This section does not:
