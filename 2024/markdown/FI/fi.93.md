The commissioner may deny the bank from exercising the power if the commissioner finds that:
    
    (1)  specific authority does not exist for another depository institution to exercise the proposed power;
    
    (2)  if the savings bank is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the savings bank is prohibited from exercising the power under Section 24, Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. Section 1831a), and related regulations;
    
    (3)  the exercise of the power by the bank would adversely affect the safety and soundness of the bank; or

    (e)  To effectuate this section, the finance commission may adopt rules implementing the method or manner in which a savings bank exercises specific powers granted under this section, including rules regarding the exercise of a power that would be prohibited to savings banks under state law but for this section.
    
    (f)  The exercise of a power by a savings bank in compliance with and in the manner authorized by this section is not a violation of any statute of this state.
