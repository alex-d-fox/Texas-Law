    SUBCHAPTER D.  ACQUISITION OF CONTROL AND CHANGE OF KEY INDIVIDUAL
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 152.151.  ACQUISITION OF CONTROL.  (a)  A person or group of persons acting in concert seeking to acquire control of a money services licensee must obtain written approval from the commissioner before acquiring control.  An individual is not considered to acquire control of a money services licensee and is not subject to the acquisition of control provisions of this subchapter if that individual becomes a key individual in the ordinary course of business.
    
    (b)  A person or group of persons acting in concert seeking to acquire control of a money services licensee shall, in cooperation with the licensee, submit:
    
    (1)  an application in a form and medium prescribed by the commissioner; and
    
    (2)  a nonrefundable fee in the amount established by commission rule.
    
    (c)  On request, the commissioner may permit a money services licensee or the person or group of persons acting in concert to submit some or all information required by the commissioner under Subsection (b)(1) without using the NMLS.
    
    (d)  The application required by Subsection (b)(1) must include information required by Section [152.105](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=152.105) for any new key individual that has not previously completed the requirements of Section [152.105](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=152.105) for the money services licensee.
    
    (e)  When an application for acquisition of control under this section appears to include all the items and address all of the matters that are required, the application is considered complete and the commissioner shall promptly notify the applicant in writing of the date on which the application was determined to be complete.
    
    (f)  The commissioner shall approve or deny the application not later than the 60th day after the completion date.  If the application is not approved or denied before the 61st day after the completion date, the application is approved and the person or group of persons acting in concert are not prohibited from acquiring control.  The commissioner may extend the application period for good cause.
    
    (g)  A determination by the commissioner under Subsection (e) that an application is complete and is accepted for processing is not an assessment of the substance of the application or of the sufficiency of the information provided.  That determination means only that the application, on its face, appears to include all of the items and address all of the matters that are required under Subsection (b).
    
    (h)  When an application is filed and considered complete under Subsection (e), the commissioner shall investigate the financial condition and responsibility, financial and business experience, character, and general fitness of the person or group of persons acting in concert seeking to acquire control.
    
    (i)  The commissioner shall approve an acquisition of control under this section if the commissioner finds that:
    
    (1)  the requirements of Subsections (b) and (d) have been met, as applicable; and
    
    (2)  it is in the interest of the public to permit the person or group of persons acting in concert to control the money services licensee, considering:
    
    (A)  the financial condition and responsibility, financial and business experience, competence, character, and general fitness of the person or group of persons acting in concert seeking to acquire control; and
    
    (B)  the experience, competence, character, and general fitness of the key individuals and persons that would be in control of the money services licensee after the acquisition of control.
    
    (j)  If an applicant participates in or is subject to a multistate licensing process:
    
    (1)  the commissioner may accept the investigation results of a lead investigative state for the purpose of Subsection (h) if the lead investigative state has sufficient staffing, expertise, and minimum standards; or
    
    (2)  if this state is a lead investigative state, the commissioner may investigate the applicant under Subsection (h) and the time frames established by agreement through the multistate licensing process, provided that the time frame complies with the period in Subsection (f).
    
    (k)  If the commissioner determines that a proposed person in control fails to meet the qualifications or satisfy the requirements of this chapter, the commissioner shall inform the money services licensee and the proposed person in control in writing that the application is denied and state the reasons for the denial.  The money services licensee or the proposed person in control may appeal the denial by filing a written request for a hearing with the commissioner not later than the 30th day after the date the notice is mailed.  A hearing on the denial must be held not later than the 45th day after the date the commissioner receives the written request unless the administrative law judge extends the period for good cause or the parties agree to a later hearing date.  The hearing is considered a contested case hearing and is subject to Section [152.451](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=152.451).

    (4)  a person who is exempt under Section [152.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=152.004)(7);
    
    (5)  a person who the commissioner determines is not subject to Subsection (a) based on the public interest;
    
    (6)  a public offering of securities of a money services licensee or a person in control of a money services licensee; or
    
    (7)  an internal reorganization of a person in control of the money services licensee resulting in the same person remaining in control of the licensee.
    
    (m)  A person to whom Subsections (a) and (b) do not apply under Subsection (l)(2), (3), (4), (6), or (7) shall, in cooperation with the money services licensee, notify the commissioner not later than the 15th day after the date of the acquisition of control of the person's grounds for not complying with Subsection (a) or (b).

    (1)  the person has not:

    (B)  controlled a money services licensee that has had a money services license revoked or suspended while the person was in control of the licensee in the previous five years;
    
    (2)  if the person is a money services licensee, the person:

    (5)  the money services licensee to be acquired will not implement any material changes to the licensee's business plan as a result of the acquisition of control, and if the person acquiring control is a money services licensee, the acquiring licensee also will not implement any material changes to its business plan as a result of the acquisition of control; and
    
    (6)  the person provides notice of the acquisition in cooperation with the money services licensee and attests to Subdivisions (1) through (5), as applicable, in a form and medium prescribed by the commissioner.

    (3)  if the security is a bond, be issued by a qualified surety company authorized to engage in business in this state and acceptable to the commissioner or, if the security is an irrevocable letter of credit, be issued by a financial institution acceptable to the commissioner.
    
    (b)  A claimant may bring suit directly on the security, or the commissioner may bring suit on behalf of the claimant or the state, either in one action or in successive actions.
    
    (c)  The commissioner may collect from the security or proceeds of the security any delinquent fee, assessment, cost, penalty, or other amount imposed on and owed by a money services licensee.  If the security is a surety bond, the commissioner shall give the surety reasonable prior notice of a hearing to impose an administrative penalty against the money services licensee, provided that a surety may not be considered an interested, aggrieved, or affected person for purposes of an administrative proceeding under Section [152.451](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=152.451) of this code or Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code.
    
    (d)  A security remains in effect until canceled, which may occur only after providing 30 days' written notice to the commissioner.  Cancellation does not affect any liability incurred or accrued during the period covered by the security.
    
    (e)  A security must cover claims for at least five years after the money services licensee surrenders the licensee's license or otherwise ceases to engage in activities for which a license is required under this subchapter.  However, the commissioner may permit the amount of the security to be reduced or eliminated before that time to the extent that the amount of the money services licensee's obligations to the department and to purchasers in this state is reduced.  The commissioner may permit a money services licensee to substitute another form of security when the licensee ceases to provide money transmission in this state.
    
    (f)  If the commissioner at any time reasonably determines that the required security is insecure, deficient in amount, or exhausted in whole or in part, the commissioner by written order shall require the money services licensee to file or make new or additional security to comply with this section.
    
    (g)  Instead of providing all or part of the amount of the security required by this section, an applicant for a money services license or a money services licensee may deposit, with a financial institution possessing trust powers that is authorized to conduct a trust business in this state and is acceptable to the commissioner, an aggregate amount of United States currency, certificates of deposit, or other cash equivalents that equals the total amount of the required security or the remaining part of the security.
    
    (h)  A deposit under Subsection (g):
    
    (1)  must be held in trust in the name of and be pledged to the commissioner;
    
    (2)  must secure the same obligations as the security; and
    
    (3)  is subject to other conditions and terms the commissioner may reasonably require.
    
    (i)  The security is considered by operation of law to be held in trust for the benefit of this state and any individual to whom an obligation arising under this chapter is owed, and may not be considered an asset or property of the money services licensee in the event of bankruptcy, receivership, or a claim against the licensee unrelated to the licensee's obligations under this chapter.

Notice under this subsection is considered to be given if performed under a multistate agreement or through the NMLS.
    
    (f)  Funds drawn on a letter of credit, and any other permissible investments held in trust for the benefit of the purchasers and holders of the money transmission licensee's outstanding money transmission obligations, are considered held in trust for the benefit of those purchasers and holders on a pro rata and equitable basis in accordance with statutes under which permissible investments are required to be held in this state, and other states, as applicable.
    
    (g)  A trust established under Subsection (c) shall be terminated on extinguishment of all of the money transmission licensee's outstanding money transmission obligations.
    
    (h)  The commissioner may allow other types of investments that the commissioner determines are of sufficient liquidity and quality to be a permissible investment.  The commissioner may participate in efforts with other state regulators to determine that other types of investments are of sufficient liquidity and quality to be a permissible investment.
