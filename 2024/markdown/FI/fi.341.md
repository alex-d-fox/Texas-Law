(a)  The commissioner under Chapter [180](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=180) shall establish, administer, and maintain a state-licensed residential mortgage loan originator recovery fund as provided by this subchapter.  The amounts received by the commissioner for deposit in the fund shall be held by the commissioner in trust for carrying out the purposes of the fund.
    
    (b)  Subject to this subsection, the fund shall be used to reimburse residential mortgage loan applicants for actual damages incurred because of acts committed by a state-licensed residential mortgage loan originator who was licensed under Chapter [342](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=342), [347](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=347), [348](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=348), or [351](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=351) when the act was committed.  The use of the fund is limited to reimbursement for out-of-pocket losses caused by an act that constitutes a violation of Chapter [180](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=180) or this subtitle.  Payments from the fund may not be made to a lender who makes a residential mortgage loan originated by the state-licensed residential mortgage loan originator or who acquires a residential mortgage loan originated by the state-licensed residential mortgage loan originator.
    
    (c)  The fund may be used at the discretion of the commissioner to reimburse expenses incurred to secure and destroy residential mortgage loan documents that have been abandoned by a current or former state-licensed residential mortgage loan originator under the regulatory authority of the agency.
