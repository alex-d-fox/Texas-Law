    (1)  be under oath and in a form prescribed by the banking commissioner;

In the absence of rules, information obtained by the banking commissioner under this section is confidential and may not be disclosed by the banking commissioner or any employee of the department except as provided by Subchapter [D](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=31.301), Chapter [31](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=31).

    (2)  the applicant requests confidential treatment and represents that a public announcement of the tender offer and the filing of appropriate forms with the Securities and Exchange Commission or the appropriate federal banking agency, as applicable, will occur within the period of deferral; and
    
    (3)  the banking commissioner determines that the public interest will not be harmed by the requested confidential treatment.
    
    (f)  The banking commissioner may waive the requirement that a notice be published or permit delayed publication on a determination that waiver or delay is in the public interest.

A hearing held under this section is confidential and closed to the public.
    
    (b)  Based on the record, the banking commissioner may issue an order denying an application if:
    
    (1)  the acquisition would substantially lessen competition, restrain trade, result in a monopoly, or further a combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the banking industry in any part of this state, unless:
    
    (A)  the anticompetitive effects of the proposed acquisition are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the acquisition in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served;  and

    (5)  the bank will not be solvent, have adequate capitalization, or comply with the law of this state after the acquisition;
    
    (6)  the proposed transferee has not furnished all information pertinent to the application reasonably required by the banking commissioner;  or
    
    (7)  the proposed transferee is not acting in good faith.
    
    (c)  If the banking commissioner approves the application, the transaction may be consummated.  If the approval is conditioned on a written commitment from the proposed transferee offered to and accepted by the banking commissioner, the commitment is enforceable against the bank and the transferee and is considered for all purposes an agreement under this subtitle.
