    Sec. 202.001.  ACQUISITION OF BANK OR BANK HOLDING COMPANY.
    
    (a)  This section applies to a company intending to acquire a Texas bank holding company or a Texas bank.  For purposes of this section, a Texas bank holding company does not include a bank holding company of which the only subsidiaries are state savings banks.
    
    (a-1)  A company described by Subsection (a) shall submit to the commissioner a copy of the application for approval or notice submitted to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System under Section 3, Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. Section 1842).  The copy must be:
    
    (1)  submitted to the commissioner when the application is submitted to the board of governors;
    
    (2)  accompanied by any additional information required under Subsection (b); and
    
    (3)  accompanied by any filing fee required by law.
    
    (b)  An applicant or notificant that is an out-of-state bank holding company shall provide satisfactory evidence to the commissioner of compliance with or inapplicability of:
    
    (1)  the requirements of Section [202.003](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=202.003);  and
    
    (2)  if the applicant or notificant is not incorporated under the laws of this state, the laws of this state relating to registration of foreign corporations to do business in this state.
    
    (c)  On receipt of the notice prescribed by Section 3(b), Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. Section 1842(b)), the commissioner shall state in writing within the period prescribed by that subsection the commissioner's:
    
    (1)  views and recommendations concerning the proposed transaction;
    
    (2)  opinion regarding whether the proposed transaction complies with this chapter and the Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act;  and
    
    (3)  opinion regarding whether the proposed transaction complies with the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (12 U.S.C. Section 2901 et seq.), as amended.
    
    (d)  The commissioner is not required to disapprove the application or notice solely because of the opinion stated under Subsection (c)(3).
    
    (e)  If the commissioner's response disapproves an application for or notice of an acquisition of a Texas state bank or a Texas bank holding company controlling a Texas state bank, the commissioner may:
    
    (1)  appear at the hearing held as provided by Section 3(b), Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. Section 1842(b));  and
    
    (2)  present evidence at the hearing regarding the reasons the application or notice should be denied.
    
    (f)  If the commissioner's response disapproves an application for or notice of an acquisition other than as described by Subsection (e), the commissioner may request that a hearing be held as provided by Section 3(b), Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. Section 1842(b)).  If the board of governors grants the request, the commissioner shall appear and present evidence at the hearing regarding the reasons the application or notice should be denied.
    
    (g)  If the board of governors approves an application or notice that the commissioner disapproved, the commissioner may accept the decision or attempt to overturn the decision on appeal as provided by Section 9, Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. Section 1848).

The bank holding company shall submit other information reasonably requested by the commissioner to determine the manner in which the acquisition, election, or activity will directly or indirectly affect residents of this state.
    
    (b)  To assist in determining whether to disapprove the proposed acquisition, election, or activity, the commissioner may hold a public hearing as provided by Section [31.201](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=31.201), regardless of whether requested to do so by a person, regarding the proposed acquisition, election, or activity and its effect on this state.  The commissioner shall convene a hearing if the bank holding company requests a hearing in writing when it submits the application, election, or notice to the commissioner.
    
    (c)  The commissioner shall disapprove the proposed acquisition, election, or activity if the commissioner determines that the acquisition, election, or activity would be detrimental to the public interest as a result of probable adverse effects, including undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices.
