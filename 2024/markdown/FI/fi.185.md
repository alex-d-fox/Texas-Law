The order must:
    
    (1)  be delivered by personal delivery or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested;
    
    (2)  state with reasonable certainty the grounds for the order;  and

    (c)  The order takes effect if the state trust company or person against whom the order is directed does not request a hearing in writing before the effective date.  After taking effect, the order is final and nonappealable as to that state trust company or person.

    (b)  In determining the amount of any penalty to be imposed, the banking commissioner shall consider the following factors:
    
    (1)  the financial resources of the state trust company or other person;
    
    (2)  the good faith of the state trust company or other person, including any corrective action taken;

(a)  When a penalty order under Section [185.010](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=185.010) becomes final, a state trust company or other person, as applicable, shall pay the penalty or appeal by filing a petition for judicial review.
    
    (b)  The petition for judicial review stays the penalty order during the period preceding the decision of the court.  If the court sustains the order, the court shall order the state trust company or other person, as applicable, to pay the full amount of the penalty or a lower amount determined by the court.  If the court does not sustain the order, a penalty is not owed.  If the final judgment of the court requires payment of a penalty, interest accrues on the penalty, at the rate charged on loans to depository institutions by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, beginning on the date the judgment is final and ending on the date the penalty and interest are paid.
    
    (c)  If the state trust company or other person, as applicable, does not pay the penalty imposed under a final and nonappealable penalty order, the banking commissioner shall refer the matter to the attorney general for enforcement.  The attorney general is entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees from the state trust company or other person, as applicable, if the attorney general prevails in judicial action necessary for collection of the penalty.
