    (1)  the activities of a state trust company affiliate; and

    (c)  To promote regulatory efficiency, if, in the preceding 24 months, a third-party service provider or affiliate has been examined by a federal or state financial services regulatory agency or by a member agency of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, or its successor agency, the banking commissioner may accept the results of that examination instead of conducting the banking commissioner's own examination of the third-party service provider or affiliate.  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as limiting or restricting the banking commissioner from participating in an examination of a third-party service provider or affiliate conducted by a federal or state financial services regulatory agency or by a member agency of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, or its successor agency.
    
    (d)  A third-party service provider that refuses to submit to examination or to pay an assessed fee for examination under this section is subject to an enforcement action under Chapter [185](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=185).  With respect to a third-party service provider's refusal to submit to examination, the banking commissioner may notify all state trust companies of the refusal and warn that continued use of the third-party service provider may constitute an unsafe and unsound fiduciary practice.

The banking commissioner may not disclose information under this section that is confidential under applicable state or federal law unless:
    
    (1)  the recipient agency agrees to maintain the confidentiality and take all reasonable steps to oppose an effort to secure disclosure of the information from the agency;  or

    (c)  The banking commissioner by agreement may establish an information sharing and exchange program with a functional regulatory agency that has overlapping regulatory jurisdiction with the department, with respect to all or part of an affiliated group, including a financial institution, to reduce the potential for duplicative and burdensome filings, examinations, and other regulatory activities.  Each agency party to the agreement must agree to maintain confidentiality of information that is confidential under applicable state or federal law and take all reasonable steps to oppose any effort to secure disclosure of the information from the agency.  An agreement may also specify procedures regarding use and handling of confidential information and identify types of information to be shared and procedures for sharing on a recurring basis.
    
    (d)  Disclosure of information by or to the banking commissioner under this section does not constitute a waiver of or otherwise affect or diminish an evidentiary privilege to which the information is otherwise subject, whether or not the disclosure is governed by a confidentiality agreement.
    
    (e)  Notwithstanding other law, an agency of this state:
    
    (1)  may execute, honor, and comply with an agreement to maintain confidentiality and oppose disclosure of information obtained from the banking commissioner as provided in this section;  and
    
    (2)  shall treat as confidential any information obtained from the banking commissioner that is entitled to confidential treatment under applicable state or federal law and take all reasonable steps to oppose an effort to secure disclosure of the information from the agency.
