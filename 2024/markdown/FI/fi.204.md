    (2)  a fact or condition exists which, if it had existed at the time of the foreign bank's original notice to engage in fiduciary activities, would have resulted in the commissioner denying authority to engage in fiduciary activities.

    (1)  dollar deposits;
    
    (2)  bonds, notes, debentures, or other legally created, general obligations of a state, an agency or political subdivision of a state, the United States, or an instrumentality of the United States;
    
    (3)  securities that this state, an agency or political subdivision of this state, the United States, or an instrumentality of the United States has unconditionally agreed to purchase, insure, or guarantee;
    
    (4)  securities issued or guaranteed by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Government National Mortgage Association, the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, or the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation;
    
    (5)  obligations of or issued or guaranteed by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the InterAmerican Development Bank, or the North American Development Bank;  or

The commissioner may give credit to reserves required to be maintained with a federal reserve bank in or outside this state pursuant to federal law, in accordance with rules adopted under this subtitle.
    
    (c)  While a foreign bank continues business in the ordinary course, the foreign bank may collect interest on the money and securities deposited under this section and from time to time exchange, examine, and verify the securities.

    Sec. 204.114.  ASSET MAINTENANCE.  (a)  In accordance with rules adopted under this subtitle, a foreign bank licensed to establish and maintain a Texas state branch or agency shall at all times satisfy the ratio of branch or agency assets to liabilities determined by the commissioner, in the commissioner's sole discretion, to be necessary or desirable with respect to the foreign bank.  The type of assets to be held in this state are specified by Subsection (b) and the type of liabilities to be included in the ratio are specified by Subsection (c).
    
    (b)  Assets to be held in this state for the purpose of satisfying the ratio of assets to liabilities:
    
    (1)  include:
    
    (A)  currency, bonds, notes, debentures, drafts, bills of exchange, or other evidences of indebtedness, including loan participation agreements or certificates;
    
    (B)  other obligations payable in the United States or in United States funds or, with the prior approval of the commissioner, in funds freely convertible into United States funds;  and
    
    (C)  other assets the commissioner permits or as may be specified by rule;  and
    
    (2)  exclude obligations of a person for money borrowed to the extent that the total of the obligations of the person exceeds 10 percent of total assets considered for purposes of this section.
    
    (c)  Liabilities included for purposes of calculating the ratio of assets to liabilities:
    
    (1)  include all liabilities of the foreign bank appearing in the books, accounts, or records of its Texas state branch or agency, including acceptances;  and
    
    (2)  exclude amounts due and other liabilities to other offices, agencies, branches, and wholly owned subsidiaries of the foreign bank, and other liabilities the commissioner determines.  The existence of a nominal number of directors' shares outstanding does not cause a subsidiary to be considered less than wholly owned.
    
    (d)  Subject to rules adopted under this subtitle, the commissioner, in the commissioner's sole discretion, may vary the ratio of assets to liabilities required by this section for a foreign bank as may be necessary or desirable to reflect differences among Texas branches or Texas agencies because of:
    
    (1)  the financial condition of Texas branch or agency offices of the foreign bank;
    
    (2)  the financial condition of branch or agency offices of the foreign bank located in other states;
    
    (3)  the general economic conditions prevalent in the home country of the foreign bank;  or
    
    (4)  the financial condition of the foreign bank itself, including:
    
    (A)  the financial condition of its branches and agencies located in other countries;
    
    (B)  the financial condition of its affiliated bank and nonbank subsidiaries in the United States;  and
    
    (C)  the financial condition of the foreign bank on a worldwide consolidated basis or in its home country.
    
    (e)  For purposes of this section, assets must be valued at the lower of principal amount or market value.  The commissioner may determine the value of a non-marketable security, loan, or other asset or obligation held or owed to the foreign bank or its Texas state branch or agency in this state.  If the commissioner cannot determine the value of an non-marketable asset, the asset must be excluded from the ratio computation.
    
    (f)  The commissioner may require a foreign bank to deposit the assets required to be held in this state pursuant to this section with specific banks in this state designated by the commissioner if, because of the existence or the potential occurrence of unusual and extraordinary circumstances, the commissioner considers it necessary or desirable for the maintenance of a sound financial condition, the protection of depositors, creditors, and the public interest in this state, and the maintenance of public confidence in the business of a Texas state branch or agency.

An application by a foreign bank under this section must be in the form and include the information the commissioner requires.
    
    (b)  The commissioner shall approve the application if the commissioner finds that the closing of the office will not be substantially detrimental to the foreign bank's depositors and creditors in this state.  An application may be approved subject to conditions imposed by the commissioner for the continued protection of the foreign bank's depositors and creditors in this state, including a condition that the foreign bank pledge assets in the manner specified by Section [204.113](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=204.113) for a specified period of time.
    
    (c)  When an application by a foreign bank under this section has been approved and all conditions precedent to the closing have been fulfilled, the foreign bank may close the office and an officer, manager, or agent of the foreign bank shall deliver to the commissioner:
    
    (1)  all copies of examination reports or other property of the department;
    
    (2)  a statement under oath by an authorized officer, manager, or agent of the foreign bank that all deposit and other liabilities of the Texas state branch or agency to depositors and creditors in this state have been properly discharged by payment or pledge or otherwise assumed or retained by a financial institution;
    
    (3)  the license issued by the commissioner;
    
    (4)  an appropriate board resolution closing the Texas state branch or agency;  and
    
    (5)  a statement of the location where the records of the Texas state branch or agency will be kept after the closing.

    (1)  does not currently meet the criteria established by this chapter for the original issuance of a license;
    
    (2)  has refused to permit the commissioner to examine its books, papers, accounts, records, or affairs in accordance with Sections [204.002](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=204.002) and [204.003](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=204.003);
    
    (3)  has failed to make a report required under this chapter or made a material false or misleading statement in the report;
    
    (4)  has violated this subtitle, another law or rule applicable to a foreign bank or a Texas state branch or agency, or a final and enforceable order of the commissioner or the finance commission;
    
    (5)  has misrepresented or concealed a material fact in the original application for license;
    
    (6)  has violated a condition of its license or an agreement between the foreign bank and the commissioner or the department;  or
    
    (7)  conducts business in an unsafe and unsound manner.

    (4)  state the grounds for the proposed revocation with reasonable certainty.
    
    (b)  Unless the foreign bank requests a hearing in writing on or before the effective date of the proposed order, the order takes effect as proposed and is final and nonappealable.
    
    (c)  A hearing requested on a proposed order shall be held not later than the 30th day after the date the written request for hearing is received by the department unless the parties agree to a later hearing date.  The department shall participate as the opposing party, and the commissioner shall conduct the hearing and one or more prehearing conferences and opportunities for discovery as the commissioner considers advisable and consistent with applicable statutes and rules.  The foreign bank may not accept new business during the pendency of the hearing unless the commissioner gives prior written approval, except that it shall comply with any stricter requirements imposed by Section 7(e), International Banking Act (12 U.S.C. Section 3105(e)).

Subject to Section [204.120](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=204.120), all functions requiring a license must be immediately transferred to a branch, affiliate, or agency of the foreign bank that is located outside of this state and that has the power to perform those functions under governing law.

    Sec. 204.120.  SEIZURE AND LIQUIDATION.  (a)  If the commissioner finds that any of the factors set forth in Section [204.116](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=204.116) are true with respect to a foreign bank licensed to establish and maintain a Texas state branch or agency, the commissioner may by order immediately take possession of the property and business of the foreign bank in this state if that action is necessary or desirable for the protection of the interests of the depositors and creditors of the foreign bank's business in this state or for the protection of the public.  The commissioner shall retain possession until the foreign bank resumes business in this state or is finally liquidated, except that the commissioner may permit the foreign bank to resume business in this state on conditions the commissioner requires.  An order issued under this section shall be served on the foreign bank in the manner required by Section [204.117](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=204.117)(a)(2).
    
    (b)  As soon as practicable after taking possession of the property and business of a foreign bank pursuant to Subsection (a), the commissioner shall initiate a receivership proceeding by filing a copy of the order issued under this section in a district court in Travis County to be governed by Chapter [36](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=36) as if the foreign bank were a Texas state bank, except as otherwise provided by this section.  Notwithstanding the priorities established by Chapter [36](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=36), the depositors and creditors of the Texas state branch or agency, arising out of transactions with and recorded on the books of the Texas state branch or agency, have an absolute preference and priority over the creditors of the foreign bank's offices located outside this state.
    
    (c)  An action initiated that seeks to directly or indirectly affect the assets of the Texas state branch or agency is considered to be an intervention in the receivership proceeding.  Venue for an action instituted to effect, contest, or otherwise intervene in the liquidation of a Texas state branch or agency is in Travis County, except that on motion filed and served concurrently with or before the filing of the answer, the court may, on a finding of good cause, transfer the action to the county of the Texas state branch or agency location.
    
    (d)  The foreign bank may contest the commissioner's actions as provided by this subsection.  On or before the 10th day after the date the commissioner has taken possession of the property and business of a foreign bank pursuant to Subsection (a), the foreign bank, acting through a majority of its directors, may intervene in the action filed by the banking commissioner to challenge the commissioner's closing of the foreign bank's Texas state branch or agency and to enjoin the commissioner or other receiver from liquidating its assets.  The court may issue an ex parte order restraining the commissioner or other receiver from liquidating the foreign bank's assets pending a hearing on the injunction.  The commissioner or other receiver shall comply with the restraining order but may petition the court for permission to liquidate an asset as necessary to prevent its loss or diminution pending the outcome of the injunction.  The commissioner or other receiver may not be required to post bond.  The court shall hear this action as quickly as possible and shall give it priority over other business.  The foreign bank or the commissioner or other receiver may appeal the court's judgment as in other civil cases, except that the commissioner or other receiver shall retain all seized foreign bank assets pending a final appellate court order even if the commissioner does not prevail in the trial court.  If the commissioner prevails in the trial court, liquidation of the state trust company may proceed unless the trial court or appellate court orders otherwise.  If liquidation is enjoined or stayed pending appeal, the trial court retains jurisdiction to permit liquidation of an asset as necessary to prevent its loss or diminution pending the outcome of the appeal.
    
    (e)  After the commissioner or other receiver has completed the liquidation of the property and business of a foreign bank, the commissioner or other receiver shall transfer any remaining assets to the foreign bank in accordance with the court's orders, except that:
    
    (1)  if the foreign bank has an office in another state of the United States that is in liquidation and the assets of the office appear to be insufficient to pay in full the creditors of that office, the court shall order the commissioner or other receiver to transfer to the liquidator of that office the amount of the remaining assets that appears to be necessary to cover the insufficiency;  or
    
    (2)  if the foreign bank has two or more such offices in liquidation and the amount of remaining assets is less than the aggregate amount of insufficiencies with respect to the offices, the court shall order the commissioner or other receiver to distribute the remaining assets among the liquidators of the offices in the manner the court finds equitable.

Section 3105(e)), an officer, manager, or agent of the foreign bank shall deliver to the commissioner:
    
    (1)  a certified copy of:
    
    (A)  a certificate of the official responsible for records of banking corporations of the foreign bank's jurisdiction of incorporation attesting to the occurrence of dissolution or of termination or cancellation of authority or existence;
    
    (B)  an order or decree of a court directing the dissolution of the foreign bank or the termination or cancellation of its authority or existence;  or
    
    (C)  an order of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System terminating its authority under Section 7(e), International Banking Act (12 U.S.C. Section 3105(e));  and
