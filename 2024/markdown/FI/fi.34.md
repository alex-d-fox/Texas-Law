The bank may acquire or establish a subsidiary or perform new activities in an existing subsidiary beginning on the 31st day after the date the banking commissioner receives the bank's letter unless the banking commissioner specifies an earlier or later date.  The banking commissioner may extend the 30-day period on a determination that the bank's letter raises issues that require additional information or additional time for analysis.  If the period is extended, the bank may acquire or establish a subsidiary, or may perform new activities in an existing subsidiary, only on prior written approval of the banking commissioner.
    
    (f)  A subsidiary of a state bank is subject to regulation by the banking commissioner to the extent provided by Chapter [11](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=11) or [12](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=12), this subtitle, or rules adopted under this subtitle.

(a)  Except as otherwise provided by this section, a bank lawfully doing business in this state may enter into a deposit account with a minor as the sole and absolute owner of the account and may pay checks and withdrawals and otherwise act with respect to the account on the order of the minor.  A payment or delivery of rights to a minor who holds a deposit account evidenced by an acquittance signed by the minor discharges the bank to the extent of the payment made or rights delivered.
    
    (b)  The disabilities of minority of a minor who is the sole and absolute owner of the deposit account are removed for the limited purpose of enabling:
    
    (1)  the minor to enter into a depository contract with the bank;  and
    
    (2)  the bank to enforce the contract against the minor, including collection of an overdraft or account fee and submission of account history to an account reporting agency or credit reporting bureau.
    
    (c)  A parent or legal guardian of a minor may deny the minor's authority to control, transfer, draft on, or make a withdrawal from the minor's deposit account by notifying the bank in writing.  On receipt of the notice by the bank, the minor may not control, transfer, draft on, or make a withdrawal from the account during minority except with the joinder of a parent or legal guardian of the minor.
    
    (d)  If a minor with a deposit account dies, the acquittance of the minor's parent or legal guardian discharges the liability of the bank to the extent of the acquittance, except that the aggregate discharges under this subsection may not exceed $3,000.
    
    (e)  Subsection (a) does not authorize a loan to the minor by the bank, whether on pledge of the minor's savings account or otherwise, or bind the minor to repay a loan made except as provided by Subsection (b) or other law or unless the depository institution has obtained the express consent and joinder of a parent or legal guardian of the minor.  This subsection does not apply to an inadvertent extension of credit because of an overdraft from insufficient funds, a returned check or deposit, or another shortage in a depository account resulting from normal banking operations.

    (1)  that is opened with the bank by one or more persons expressly as a trustee for one or more other named persons; and
    
    (2)  for which further notice of the existence and terms of a trust is not given in writing to the bank.
    
    (b)  For a deposit account that is opened with a bank by one or more persons expressly as a trustee for one or more other named persons under or purporting to be under a written trust agreement, the trustee may provide the bank with a certificate of trust to evidence the trust relationship.  The certificate must be an affidavit of the trustee and must include the effective date of the trust, the name of the trustee, the name of or method for choosing successor trustees, the name and address of each beneficiary, the authority granted to the trustee, the disposition of the account on the death of the trustee or the survivor of two or more trustees, other information required by the bank, and an indemnification of the bank.  The bank may accept and administer the account, subject to Subchapter [B](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ES&Value=111.051), Chapter [111](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ES&Value=111), and Chapters [112](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ES&Value=112) and [113](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ES&Value=113), Estates Code, in accordance with the certificate of trust without requiring a copy of the trust agreement.  The bank is not liable for administering the account as provided by the certificate of trust, even if the certificate of trust is contrary to the terms of the trust agreement, unless the bank has actual knowledge of the terms of the trust agreement.
    
    (c)  On the death of the trustee or of the survivor of two or more trustees, the bank may pay all or part of the withdrawal value of the account with interest as provided by the certificate of trust.  If the trustee did not deliver a certificate of trust, the bank's right to treat the account as owned by a trustee ceases on the death of the trustee.  On the death of the trustee or of the survivor of two or more trustees, the bank, unless the certificate of trust provides otherwise, shall pay the withdrawal value of the account with interest in equal shares to the persons who survived the trustee, are named as beneficiaries in the certificate of trust, and can be located by the bank from its own records.  If there is not a certificate of trust, payment of the withdrawal value and interest shall be made as provided by Subchapter [B](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ES&Value=111.051), Chapter [111](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ES&Value=111), and Chapters [112](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ES&Value=112) and [113](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ES&Value=113), Estates Code.  Any payment made under this section for all or part of the withdrawal value and interest discharges any liability of the bank to the extent of the payment.  The bank may pay all or part of the withdrawal value and interest in the manner provided by this section, regardless of whether it has knowledge of a competing claim, unless the bank receives actual knowledge that payment has been restrained by court order.
    
    (d)  This section does not obligate a bank to accept a deposit account from a trustee who does not furnish a copy of the trust agreement or to search beyond its own records for the location of a named beneficiary.
    
    (e)  This section does not affect a contractual provision to the contrary that otherwise complies with the laws of this state.

    Sec. 34.307.  RIGHT OF SET-OFF.  (a)  Except as otherwise provided by the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. Section 1601 et seq.) or other federal law, a bank has a right of set-off, without further agreement or action, against all accounts owned by a depositor to whom or on whose behalf the bank has made an advance of money by loan, overdraft, or otherwise if the bank has previously disclosed this right to the depositor.  If the depositor defaults in the repayment or satisfaction of the obligation, the bank, without notice to or consent of the depositor, may set off or cancel on its books all or part of the accounts owned by the depositor and apply the value of the accounts in payment of and to the extent of the obligation.
    
    (b)  For purposes of this section, a default occurs when an obligor has failed to make a payment as provided by the terms of the loan or other credit obligation and a grace period provided for by the agreement or law has expired.  An obligation is not required to be accelerated or matured for a default to authorize set-off of the depositor's obligation against the defaulted payment.
    
    (c)  A bank may not exercise its right of set-off under this section against an account unless the account is due the depositor in the same capacity as the defaulted credit obligation.  A trust account for which a depositor is trustee, including a trustee under a certificate of trust delivered under Section [34.306](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=34.306)(b), is not subject to the right of set-off under this section unless the trust relationship is solely evidenced by the account card as provided by Subchapter [B](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ES&Value=111.051), Chapter [111](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ES&Value=111), and Chapters [112](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ES&Value=112) and [113](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=ES&Value=113), Estates Code.
    
    (d)  This section does not limit the exercise of another right of set-off, including a right under contract or common law.
