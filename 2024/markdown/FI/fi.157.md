    (b)  The commissioner may also order disciplinary action against a licensed residential mortgage loan originator, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, if the commissioner, during the current term of the license, becomes aware of any fact that would have been grounds for denial of an original license if the fact had been known by the commissioner on the date the license was granted.
    
    (c)  In addition to disciplinary action by the commissioner authorized under Subsections (a) and (b), the commissioner, if the commissioner has reasonable cause to believe that a licensed residential mortgage loan originator has violated or is about to violate this section, may issue without notice and hearing an order to cease and desist continuing a particular action or an order to take affirmative action, or both, to enforce compliance with this chapter.
    
    (d)  An order issued under Subsection (c) must contain a reasonably detailed statement of the facts on which the order is made.

The hearing shall be governed by Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code.

A bond is not required of the commissioner with respect to injunctive relief granted under this subsection.
    
    (g)  For purposes of Subsection (a), a residential mortgage loan originator is considered convicted if a sentence is imposed on that person, that person receives community supervision, including deferred adjudication community supervision, or the court defers final disposition of that person's case.
    
    (h)  If a residential mortgage loan originator fails to pay an administrative penalty that has become final or fails to comply with an order of the commissioner that has become final, in addition to any other remedy provided under law, the commissioner, on not less than 10 days' notice to the residential mortgage loan originator, may without a prior hearing suspend the residential mortgage loan originator's license.  The suspension continues until the residential mortgage loan originator has complied with the administrative order or paid the administrative penalty.  During the period of suspension, the residential mortgage loan originator may not originate a residential mortgage loan and all compensation received by the residential mortgage loan originator during the period of suspension is subject to forfeiture as provided by Section [157.031](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=157.031)(a-1).

    (2)  otherwise affiliating with a person for the purpose of engaging in the business of originating or making residential mortgage loans; and
    
    (3)  being an employee, officer, director, manager, shareholder, member, agent, contractor, or processor of a mortgage banker, residential mortgage loan company, or residential mortgage loan originator for a residential mortgage loan company.
    
    (k)  On notice and opportunity for a hearing, the commissioner may suspend the license of a residential mortgage loan originator under this chapter if an indictment or information is filed or returned alleging that the person committed a criminal offense involving fraud, theft, or dishonesty.  The suspension continues until the criminal case is dismissed or the person is acquitted.
    
    (l)  The commissioner may, in the commissioner's discretion, rescind or vacate any previously issued order.
