    Sec. 32.001.  ORGANIZATION AND GENERAL POWERS OF STATE BANK.  (a)  One or more persons, a majority of whom are residents of this state, may organize a state bank as a banking association or a limited banking association.
    
    (b)  A state bank may:
    
    (1)  receive and pay deposits with or without interest, discount and negotiate promissory notes, borrow or lend money with or without security or interest, invest and deal in securities, buy and sell exchange, coin, and bullion, and exercise incidental powers as necessary to carry on the business of banking as provided by this subtitle;
    
    (2)  act as agent, or in a substantially similar capacity, with respect to a financial activity or an activity incidental or complementary to a financial activity;
    
    (3)  act in a fiduciary capacity, without giving bond, as guardian, receiver, executor, administrator, or trustee, including a mortgage or indenture trustee;

    (e)  A state bank may be organized or reorganized as a community development financial institution or may serve as a community development partner, as those terms are defined by the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (Pub.  L. No. 103-325).
    
    (f)  In the exercise of discretion consistent with the purposes of this subtitle, the banking commissioner may require a state bank to conduct an otherwise authorized activity through a subsidiary.

    Sec. 32.009.  PARITY BETWEEN STATE AND NATIONAL BANKS.  (a)  Section 16(a), Article XVI, Texas Constitution, empowers the legislature to authorize the incorporation of state banks and provide for a system of state regulation and control of state banks that will adequately protect and secure depositors and creditors.  Section 16(c), Article XVI, Texas Constitution, grants to state banks created by virtue of the power vested in the legislature by Section 16(a) of that article the same rights and privileges that are or may be granted to national banks domiciled in this state.  The legislature finds that Section 16(c) of that article does not restrict the legislature's power to provide a system of state regulation under Section 16(a) of that article that differs from the regulatory scheme imposed on national banks under federal law or prevent the finance commission, acting under authority granted by the legislature for the purpose of implementing this subtitle, from adopting rules that differ from federal statutes and regulations or that reasonably regulate the method or manner by which a state bank exercises its rights and privileges if the rules are adopted after due consideration of the factors listed in Section [31.003](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=31.003)(b).  The legislature further finds that Section 16(c), Article XVI, Texas Constitution, does not limit any rights or powers specifically given to state banks by the laws of this state.
    
    (b)  A state bank that intends to exercise a right or privilege granted to national banks that is not authorized for state banks under the statutes and rules of this state shall submit a letter to the banking commissioner describing in detail the activity in which the bank intends to engage and the specific authority of a national bank to engage in that activity.  The bank shall attach copies, if available, of relevant federal law, regulations, and interpretive letters.  The bank may begin to perform the proposed activity after the 30th day after the date the banking commissioner receives the bank's letter unless the banking commissioner specifies an earlier or later date or prohibits the activity.  The banking commissioner may prohibit the bank from performing the activity only if the banking commissioner finds that:
    
    (1)  a national bank domiciled in this state does not possess the specific right or privilege to perform the activity the bank seeks to perform;  or
    
    (2)  the performance of the activity by the bank would adversely affect the safety and soundness of the bank.
    
    (c)  The banking commissioner may extend the 30-day period under Subsection (b) if the banking commissioner determines that the bank's letter raises issues requiring additional information or additional time for analysis.  If the 30-day period is extended, the bank may perform the proposed activity only on prior written approval by the banking commissioner, except that the banking commissioner must approve or prohibit the proposed activity or convene a hearing under Section [31.201](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=31.201) not later than the 60th day after the date the banking commissioner receives the bank's letter.  If a hearing is convened, the banking commissioner must approve or prohibit the proposed activity not later than the 30th day after the date the hearing is completed.
    
    (d)  A state bank that is denied the requested right or privilege to engage in an activity by the banking commissioner under this section may appeal as provided by Sections [31.202](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=31.202) and [31.204](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=31.204) or may resubmit a letter under this subsection with additional information or authority relevant to the banking commissioner's determination.  A denial is immediately final for purposes of appeal.
    
    (e)  To effectuate the Texas Constitution, the finance commission may adopt rules implementing the method or manner in which a state bank exercises specific rights and privileges granted under Section 16(c), Article XVI, Texas Constitution, including rules regarding the exercise of rights and privileges that would be prohibited to state banks but for Section 16(c) of that article.  The finance commission may not adopt rules under this subsection unless it considers the factors listed in Section [31.003](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=31.003)(b) and finds that:
    
    (1)  national banks domiciled in this state possess the rights or privileges to perform activities the rule would permit state banks to perform;  and
    
    (2)  the rules contain adequate safeguards and controls, consistent with safety and soundness, to address the concern of the legislature evidenced by the state law the rules would impact.
    
    (f)  The exercise of rights and privileges by a state bank in compliance with and in the manner authorized by this section is not a violation of any statute of this state.

This section may not be used by a Texas state bank to alter or negate the application of the laws of this state with respect to:
    
    (1)  establishment and maintenance of a branch in this state or another state or country;
    
    (2)  permissible interest rates and loan fees chargeable in this state;

    (C)  real estate development, marketing, and sales activities.
    
    (b)  A state bank that intends to exercise a power, directly or through a subsidiary, granted by Subsection (a) that is not otherwise authorized for state banks under the statutes of this state shall submit a letter to the banking commissioner describing in detail the power that the bank proposes to exercise and the specific authority of another depository institution to exercise the power.  The bank shall attach copies, if available, of relevant law, regulations, and interpretive letters.  The bank may begin to exercise the proposed power after the 30th day after the date the banking commissioner receives the bank's letter unless the banking commissioner specifies an earlier or later date or prohibits the activity.  The banking commissioner may prohibit the bank from exercising the power only if the banking commissioner finds that:
    
    (1)  specific authority does not exist for another depository institution to exercise the proposed power;
    
    (2)  if the state bank is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the state bank is prohibited from exercising the power pursuant to Section 24, Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. Section 1831a), and related regulations;  or
    
    (3)  the exercise of the power by the bank would adversely affect the safety and soundness of the bank.
    
    (c)  The banking commissioner may extend the 30-day period under Subsection (b) if the banking commissioner determines that the bank's letter raises issues requiring additional information or additional time for analysis.  If the 30-day period is extended, the bank may exercise the proposed power only on prior written approval by the banking commissioner, except that the banking commissioner must approve or prohibit the proposed power or convene a hearing under Section [31.201](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=31.201) not later than the 60th day after the date the banking commissioner receives the bank's letter.  If a hearing is convened, the banking commissioner must approve or prohibit the proposed power not later than the 30th day after the date the hearing is completed.
    
    (d)  A state bank that is denied the requested power by the banking commissioner under this section may appeal as provided by Sections [31.202](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=31.202) and [31.204](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=31.204) or may resubmit a letter under this section with additional information or authority relevant to the banking commissioner's determination.  A denial is immediately final for purposes of appeal.
    
    (e)  To effectuate this section, the finance commission may adopt rules implementing the method or manner in which a state bank exercises specific powers granted under this section, including rules regarding the exercise of a power that would be prohibited to state banks under state law but for this section.  The finance commission may not adopt rules under this subsection unless it considers the factors listed in Section [31.003](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=31.003)(b) and finds that:
    
    (1)  the conditions for prohibition by the banking commissioner under Subsection (b) do not exist;  and
    
    (2)  if the rights and privileges would be prohibited to state banks under other state law, the rules contain adequate safeguards and controls, consistent with safety and soundness, to address the concern of the legislature evidenced by the state law the rules would affect.
    
    (f)  The exercise of a power by a state bank in compliance with and in the manner authorized by this section is not a violation of any statute of this state.

(a)  A state bank may purchase assets from another financial institution or other seller, except that the prior written approval of the banking commissioner is required if the purchase price exceeds an amount equal to three times the bank's unimpaired capital and surplus.

    (b)  If the purchasing bank acts under written contract of agency approved by the banking commissioner that specifically names each depositor and creditor and the amount to be paid each, and if the agency is limited to the purely ministerial act of paying those depositors and creditors the amounts due them as determined by the selling institution and reflected in the contract of agency and does not involve discretionary duties or authority other than the identification of the depositors and creditors named, the purchasing bank:
    
    (1)  may rely on the contract of agency and the instructions included in it;  and
    
    (2)  is not responsible for:
    
    (A)  any error made by the selling institution in determining its liabilities, the depositors and creditors to whom the liabilities are due, or the amounts due the depositors and creditors;  or
    
    (B)  any preference that results from the payments made under the contract of agency and the instructions included in it.

    Sec. 32.405.  SALE OF ASSETS.  (a)  A state bank may sell a portion of its assets to another financial institution or other buyer, except that the prior written approval of the banking commissioner is required if the sales price exceeds an amount equal to three times the bank's unimpaired capital and surplus.  The finance commission by rule may require a state bank to obtain the prior written approval of the banking commissioner for a transaction not otherwise subject to approval that involves potentially substantial risks to the safety and soundness of the selling bank.
    
    (b)  If the prior approval of the banking commissioner for a sale of assets is not required under Subsection (a) and the sale involves the disposition of a branch office or another established location of the state bank, the state bank must provide written notice of the transaction to the banking commissioner at least 30 days before the expected closing date of the transaction.
    
    (c)  The board of a state bank, with the prior written approval of the banking commissioner, may cause the bank to sell all or substantially all of its assets without shareholder approval if:

    (2)  the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or its successor approves the transaction and agrees to provide assistance to the prospective buyer under 12 U.S.C. Section 1823(c) or a comparable law unless the deposits of the bank are not insured.

    (1)  all of the bank's liabilities to depositors;
    
    (2)  all of the bank's liabilities for salaries of the bank's employees incurred before the date of the sale;
    
    (3)  obligations incurred by the banking commissioner arising out of the supervision or sale of the bank; and
    
    (4)  fees and assessments due the department.
    
    (e)  This section does not affect the banking commissioner's right to take action under another law.  The sale by a state bank of all or substantially all of its assets with shareholder approval is considered a voluntary dissolution and liquidation and is governed by Subchapter B, Chapter [36](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=36).

    (b)  The merger or conversion by the state bank must be made and approval of its board and shareholders must be obtained in accordance with the Business Organizations Code as if the state bank were a filing entity and all other parties to the transaction, if any, were foreign entities, except as provided by rule.  For purposes of this subsection, a conversion is considered a merger into the successor form of financial institution.
    
    (c)  The state bank does not cease to be a state bank subject to the supervision of the banking commissioner unless:
    
    (1)  the banking commissioner has been given written notice of the intention to merge or convert before the 31st day before the date of the proposed transaction;
    
    (2)   the bank has filed with the banking commissioner:

A banking association or limited banking association may convert its organizational form under this section.
    
    (b)  A financial institution applying to convert into a state bank may receive a certificate of authority to do business as a state bank if the banking commissioner finds that:

    (3)  the financial institution can be expected to operate profitably after the conversion;
    
    (4)  the officers and directors of the financial institution as a group have sufficient banking experience, ability, standing, competence, trustworthiness, and integrity to justify a belief that the financial institution will operate as a state bank in compliance with law;
    
    (5)  each principal shareholder has sufficient experience, ability, standing, competence, trustworthiness, and integrity to justify a belief that the financial institution will be free from improper or unlawful influence or interference with respect to the financial institution's operation as a state bank in compliance with law; and
    
    (6)  if the converting financial institution did not have general depository powers and the state bank will have those powers, the factors set forth in Section [32.003](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=32.003)(b) are satisfied.
    
    (c)  The banking commissioner may:
    
    (1)  request additional information considered necessary to an informed decision under this section;
    
    (2)  perform an examination of the converting financial institution at the expense of the converting financial institution;  and
    
    (3)  require that examination fees be paid before a certificate of authority is issued.
    
    (d)  In connection with the application, the converting financial institution must:
    
    (1)  submit a statement of the law governing the exit of the financial institution from the regulatory system applicable before the conversion and the terms of the transition into a state bank;  and
    
    (2)  demonstrate that all applicable law has been fully satisfied.
