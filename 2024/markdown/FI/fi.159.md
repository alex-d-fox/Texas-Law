    SUBCHAPTER G.  ENFORCEMENT OF CHAPTER
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 159.301.  CEASE AND DESIST ORDER.  (a)  The commissioner, if the commissioner has reasonable cause to believe that a wrap lender or wrap mortgage loan originator to whom this chapter applies has violated or is about to violate this chapter, may issue without notice and hearing an order to cease and desist from continuing a particular action or an order to take affirmative action, or both, to enforce compliance with this chapter.
    
    (b)  An order issued under Subsection (a) must contain a reasonably detailed statement of the facts on which the order is made.  If a person against whom the order is made requests a hearing, the commissioner shall set and give notice of a hearing before the commissioner or a hearings officer.  The hearing shall be governed by Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code.  Based on the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations of the hearings officer, the commissioner by order may find a violation has occurred or not occurred.
    
    (c)  If a hearing is not requested under Subsection (b) on or before the 30th day after the date on which an order is made, the order is considered final and not appealable.
    
    (d)  The commissioner, after giving notice and an opportunity for hearing, may impose against a person who violates a cease and desist order an administrative penalty in an amount not to exceed $1,000 for each day of the violation.  In addition to any other remedy provided by law, the commissioner may institute in district court a suit for injunctive relief and to collect the administrative penalty.  A bond is not required of the commissioner with respect to injunctive relief granted under this subsection.
