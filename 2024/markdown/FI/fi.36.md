If liquidation is enjoined or stayed pending appeal, the trial court retains jurisdiction to permit liquidation of an asset as necessary to prevent its loss or diminution pending the outcome of the appeal.

The fictional tracing rule does not apply.  To the extent of any unsatisfied fiduciary claim to commingled money, a claimant to commingled trust money is entitled to the same priority as a depositor of the bank.

    (b)  The banking commissioner may place temporary limits on the right of withdrawals by or payments to individual depositors and creditors of a bank reopened under this section.  The limits:
    
    (1)  must apply equally to all unsecured depositors and creditors;

    Sec. 36.301.  FILING CLAIM.  (a)  This section applies only to a claim by a person, other than a shareholder acting in that capacity, who has a claim against a state bank in liquidation, including a claimant with a secured claim and a claimant under a fiduciary relationship who has been ordered by the receiver to file a proof of claim under Section [36.223](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=36.223).
    
    (b)  To receive payment of a claim, the person must present proof of the claim to the receiver:
    
    (1)  at a place specified by the receiver;  and
    
    (2)  within the period specified by the receiver under Section [36.205](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=36.205).
    
    (c)  A claim that is not filed within the period specified by the receiver may not participate in a distribution of the assets by the receiver, except that, subject to court approval, the receiver may accept a claim filed not later than the 180th day after the date notice of the claimant's right to file a proof of claim is mailed to the claimant.
    
    (d)  A claim accepted and approved under Subsection (c) is subordinate to an approved claim of a general creditor.
    
    (e)  Interest does not accrue on a claim after the date the bank is closed for liquidation.

    Sec. 36.302.  PROOF OF CLAIM.  (a)  A proof of claim must be in writing, be signed by the claimant, and include:
    
    (1)  a statement of the claim;
    
    (2)  a description of the consideration for the claim;
    
    (3)  a statement of whether collateral is held or a security interest is asserted against the claim and, if so, a description of the collateral or security interest;
    
    (4)  a statement of any right of priority of payment for the claim or other specific right asserted by the claimant;
    
    (5)  a statement of whether a payment has been made on the claim and, if so, the amount and source of the payment, to the extent known by the claimant;
    
    (6)  a statement that the amount claimed is justly owed by the bank in liquidation to the claimant;  and
    
    (7)  any other matter that is required by the court.
    
    (b)  The receiver may designate the form of the proof of claim.  A proof of claim must be filed under oath unless the oath is waived by the receiver.  A proof of claim filed with the receiver is considered filed in an official proceeding for purposes of Chapter [37](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&Value=37), Penal Code.
    
    (c)  If a claim is founded on a written instrument, the original instrument, unless lost or destroyed, must be filed with the proof of claim.  After the instrument is filed, the receiver may permit the claimant to substitute a copy of the instrument until the final disposition of the claim.  If the instrument is lost or destroyed, a statement of that fact and of the circumstances of the loss or destruction must be filed under oath with the claim.

    Sec. 36.303.  JUDGMENT AS PROOF OF CLAIM.  (a)  A judgment entered against a state bank in liquidation before the date the bank was closed for liquidation may not be given higher priority than a claim of an unsecured creditor unless the judgment creditor in a proof of claim proves the allegations supporting the judgment to the receiver's satisfaction.
    
    (b)  A judgment against the bank taken by default or by collusion before the date the bank was closed for liquidation may not be considered as conclusive evidence of the liability of the bank to the judgment creditor or of the amount of damages to which the judgment creditor is entitled.
    
    (c)  A judgment against the bank entered after the date the bank was closed for liquidation may not be considered as evidence of liability or of the amount of damages.

    Sec. 36.304.  SECURED CLAIM.  (a)  The owner of a secured claim against a bank in liquidation may:
    
    (1)  surrender the security and file a claim as a general creditor;  or
    
    (2)  apply the security to the claim and discharge the claim.
    
    (b)  If the owner applies the security and discharges the claim, any deficiency shall be treated as a claim against the general assets of the bank on the same basis as a claim of an unsecured creditor.  The amount of the deficiency shall be determined as provided by Section [36.305](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=36.305), except that if the amount of the deficiency has been adjudicated by a court in a proceeding in which the receiver has had notice and an opportunity to be heard, the court's decision is conclusive as to the amount.
    
    (c)  The value of security held by a secured creditor shall be determined under supervision of the court by:
    
    (1)  converting the security into money according to the terms of the agreement under which the security was delivered to the creditor;  or
    
    (2)  agreement, arbitration, compromise, or litigation between the creditor and the receiver.

    Sec. 36.305.  UNLIQUIDATED OR UNDETERMINED CLAIM.  (a)  A claim based on an unliquidated or undetermined demand shall be filed within the period provided by Subchapter C  for the filing of a claim.  The claim may not share in any distribution to claimants until the claim is definitely liquidated, determined, and allowed.  After the claim is liquidated, determined, and allowed, the claim shares ratably with the claims of the same class in all subsequent distributions.
    
    (b)  For purposes of this section, a demand is considered unliquidated or undetermined if the right of action on the demand accrued while the bank was closed for liquidation and the liability on the demand has not been determined or the amount of the demand has not been liquidated.
    
    (c)  If the receiver in all other respects is in a position to close the receivership proceeding, the proposed closing is sufficient grounds for the rejection of any remaining claim based on an unliquidated or undetermined demand.  The receiver shall notify the claimant of the intention to close the proceeding.  If the demand is not liquidated or determined before the 61st day after the date of the notice, the receiver may reject the claim.

    Sec. 36.306.  SET-OFF.  (a)  Mutual credits and mutual debts shall be set off and only the balance allowed or paid, except that a set-off may not be allowed in favor of a person if:
    
    (1)  the obligation of the bank to the person on the date the bank was closed for liquidation did not entitle the person to share as a claimant in the assets of the bank;
    
    (2)  the obligation of the bank to the person was purchased by or transferred to the person after the date the bank was closed for liquidation or for the purpose of increasing set-off rights;  or
    
    (3)  the obligation of the person or the bank is as a trustee or fiduciary.
    
    (b)  On request, the receiver shall provide a person with an accounting statement identifying each debt that is due and payable.  A person who owes the bank an amount that is due and payable against which the person asserts a set-off of mutual credits that may become due and payable from the bank in the future shall promptly pay to the receiver the amount due and payable.  The receiver shall promptly refund, to the extent of the person's prior payment, mutual credits that become due and payable to the person by the bank in liquidation.

    (c)  The receiver shall send each claimant a summary schedule of approved and rejected claims by priority class and notify the claimant:
    
    (1)  that a copy of a schedule of claims disposition including only the name of the claimant, the amount of the claim allowed, and the amount of the claim rejected is available on request;  and
    
    (2)  of the procedure and deadline for filing an objection to an approved claim.
