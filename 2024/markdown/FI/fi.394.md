    (1)  a fee not to exceed $100 for debt consultation or education services, including obtaining a credit report, setting up an account, and other similar services; and

    (A)  with respect to a debt management service agreement in which a flat fee is charged based on the total amount of debt that is included in a debt management plan, the total aggregate amount of fees charged to a consumer under this subchapter, including fees charged under Subdivisions (1) and (2), may not exceed 17 percent of the total principal amount of debt included in the debt management plan; or

    (i)  The flat fee authorized under this subchapter shall be assessed in equal monthly payments for a period that is at least as long as the term of the debt management plan, as estimated when the debt management plan is established, unless:
    
    (1)  the fee payment period is voluntarily accelerated by the consumer in an addendum to the agreement or other separate agreement; and
    
    (2)  offers of settlement by creditors have been obtained on at least half of the outstanding debt included in the debt management plan.
    
    (j)  If a consumer is enrolled in a debt management plan that provides for the settlement of debts for amounts that are less than the principal amount of the debts as a concession from creditors, if fees for debt management services will not be charged or collected until the time a settlement agreement is reached with a creditor, and if at least one payment has been made toward the settlement agreement by or on behalf of the consumer, the fee limitations in Subsection (g) do not apply and the provider may charge reasonable settlement fees.  The fee with respect to each debt included in the plan must:
    
    (1)  bear the same proportional relationship to the total fee for settling all debts included in the debt management plan as the principal amount of the particular debt bears to the total principal amount of the debt included in the plan; or
    
    (2)  be a percentage of the amount saved as a result of the settlement, determined as the difference between the principal amount of a debt and the amount actually paid to satisfy the debt.  The percentage charged cannot change from one debt to another.
    
    (k)  A provider may impose fees or other charges or receive fees or payment under only one of Subsection (f), (g), or (j).

The commissioner may approve a fee in an amount greater than $100 if the nature and extent of the educational and counseling services warrant the greater amount.
    
    (m)  If, before the expiration of the 90th day after the date debt counseling or education services are completed or canceled, a consumer enters into a debt management service agreement with a provider, the provider shall refund to the consumer any payments received under Subsection (l).

A provider shall exercise due care to appropriately manage the funds in the trust account.
