    (b)  The order:

    Sec. 37.007.  TEMPORARY BRANCH OR OFFICE.  (a)  If the banking commissioner determines that an emergency has affected and will continue to affect one or more particular bank offices for an extended period, either as a result of the emergency or subsequent recovery operations, the banking commissioner may authorize the bank or banks affected to open temporary branch offices or other facilities required for bank operations for the purpose of prompt restoration of access by the public to banking services.
    
    (b)  A temporary bank office opened under the authority of Subsection (a) may remain open only for the period specified in the banking commissioner's order, except that the banking commissioner may extend the period the office may remain open on a finding that the conditions requiring the temporary office continue to exist. The bank may convert a temporary branch office to a permanent bank location only by obtaining the prior written approval of the banking commissioner under Section [32.203](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=32.203).
    
    (c)  If requested by the state bank regulatory agency of another state that is experiencing an emergency and is contiguous to this state, the banking commissioner may authorize a bank or banks located in the state to open temporary offices in this state for the purpose of prompt restoration of banking services to the existing customers of the bank or banks, as the circumstances of such emergency may require.  A temporary bank office opened under the authority of this subsection may remain open only for the period specified in the banking commissioner's order, except that the banking commissioner may extend the period the office may remain open on a finding that the conditions requiring the temporary office continue to exist.  A bank may convert a temporary branch office to a permanent bank location if permitted by and subject to the conditions and requirements of Chapter [203](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=203).
