    (c)  Rules adopted under this subtitle may specify the confidential or nonconfidential character of information obtained by the banking commissioner under this section.  In the absence of rules, information  obtained by the banking commissioner under this section is confidential and may not be disclosed by the banking commissioner or any employee of the department except as provided by Subchapter D, Chapter [181](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=181).

    (e)  The applicant may defer publication of the notice until not later than the 34th day after the date the application is filed if:

A hearing held under this section is confidential and closed to the public.
    
    (b)  Based on the record, the banking commissioner may issue an order denying an application if:
    
    (1)  the acquisition would substantially lessen competition, be in restraint of trade, result in a monopoly, or be in furtherance of a combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the trust industry in any part of this state, unless:
    
    (A)  the anticompetitive effects of the acquisition are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of acquisition in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served;  and
    
    (B)  the acquisition is not in violation of the law of this state or the United States;

    (4)  the experience, ability, standing, competence, trustworthiness, and integrity of the transferee, or any member of a group comprising the transferee, are insufficient to justify a belief that the state trust company will be free from improper or unlawful influence or interference with respect to the state trust company's operation in compliance with law;
    
    (5)  the state trust company will not be solvent, have adequate capitalization, or be in compliance with the laws of this state after the acquisition;

    (7)  the transferee is not acting in good faith.

    (1)  enforceable against the state trust company and the transferee;  and
    
    (2)  considered for all purposes an agreement under this subtitle.

This subchapter does not prevent the banking commissioner from investigating, commenting on, or seeking to enjoin or set aside a transfer of voting securities that evidence a direct or indirect interest in a state trust company, regardless of whether the transfer is governed by this subchapter, if the banking commissioner considers the transfer to be against the public interest.
