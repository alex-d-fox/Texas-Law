    (e)  A creditor who has disclosed to an obligor that an election may be renewed under Subsection (d) is not required to give additional notice of a renewal under that subsection.
    
    (f)  To increase a previously agreed rate, a creditor shall comply with Section [303.103](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=303.103) before the end of the last calendar quarter of the period in which the rate previously agreed to is in effect.

    (b)  A notice under this section to change a provision of an account, including the rate, or the index or formula used to compute the rate, must include:
    
    (1)  the new provision, the new rate, or the index or formula to be used to compute the rate;

The form may be included on a part of the account statement that is to be returned to the creditor or on a separate sheet.  In addition to the requirements of Subsection (b), the notice must include:

    "YOU MAY TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO PAY THE NEW RATE."

    (1)  the obligor chooses to retain the privilege of using the open-end account;
    
    (2)  the obligor or a person authorized by the obligor accepts or uses an extension of credit after the fifth day after the date on which the notice is mailed;  or
    
    (3)  the obligor does not notify the creditor in writing before the 21st day after the date on which the notice is mailed that the obligor does not wish to continue to use the open-end account.
    
    (e)  An obligor who rejects a rate change in accordance with this section is entitled to pay the balance on the open-end account at the rate and over the period in effect immediately before the date of the proposed change and under the same minimum payment terms provided by the agreement.  Rejection of a new rate does not accelerate payment of the balance due.
    
    (f)  The procedure provided by this section for changing the terms of an agreement is in addition to other means of amending the agreement provided by law.
