    (b)  The banking commissioner shall grant a state trust company charter only on proof satisfactory to the banking commissioner that public convenience and advantage will be promoted by the establishment of the state trust company.

    (1)  the organizational and capital structure and amount of initial capitalization is adequate for the business and location;
    
    (2)  the anticipated volume and nature of business indicates a reasonable probability of success and profitability based on the market sought to be served;

    (c)  The organizers bear the burden of proof to establish that public convenience and advantage will be promoted by the establishment of the state trust company.

Any comment received by the department and any reply of the applicant to the comment shall be made available to the protesting party.
    
    (c)  The banking commissioner may not be compelled to hold a hearing before granting or denying the charter application.  In the exercise of discretion, the banking commissioner may consider granting a hearing on a charter application at the request of the applicant or a protesting party. The banking commissioner may order a hearing regardless of whether a hearing has been requested by a party. A party requesting a hearing must indicate with specificity the issues involved that cannot be determined on the basis of the record compiled under Subsection (b) and why the issues cannot be determined. A request for hearing and the banking commissioner's decision with regard to granting a hearing shall be made a part of the record. If the banking commissioner sets a hearing, the banking commissioner shall conduct a public hearing and as many prehearing conferences and opportunities for discovery as the banking commissioner considers advisable and consistent with governing statutes and rules, except that the banking commissioner may not permit discovery of confidential information in the charter application or the investigation report. 
    
    (d)  Based on the record, the banking commissioner shall determine whether all of the necessary conditions set forth in Section [182.003](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=182.003)(b) have been established and shall enter an order granting or denying the charter.

    Sec. 182.008.  RESTRICTED CAPITAL.  (a)  The banking commissioner may not issue a charter to a state trust company having restricted capital of less than $2 million.
    
    (b)  The banking commissioner may, on a case-by-case basis, require additional restricted capital for a proposed or existing state trust company if the banking commissioner finds the condition and operations of the existing state trust company or the proposed scope or type of operations of the proposed state trust company requires additional restricted capital to protect the safety and soundness of the state trust company.  The safety and soundness factors to be considered by the banking commissioner in the exercise of discretion include:
    
    (1)  the nature and type of business the state trust company conducts;
    
    (2)  the nature and degree of liquidity in assets held in a corporate capacity;
    
    (3)  the amount, type, and depository of fiduciary assets that the state trust company manages;

    (8)  the reasonableness of the state trust company's business plans for retaining or acquiring additional restricted capital;  and
    
    (9)  the existence and adequacy of insurance obtained or held by the state trust company to protect its clients, beneficiaries, and grantors.
    
    (c)  The effective date of an order under Subsection (b) must be stated in the order and must be on or after the 21st day after the date the order is mailed or delivered.  Unless the state trust company requests a hearing before the banking commissioner in writing before the effective date of the order, the order takes effect and is final and nonappealable.  This subsection does not prohibit an application to reduce capital requirements of an existing state trust company under Subsection (e) or under Section [182.011](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=182.011).
    
    (d)  Subject to Subsection (e) and Section [182.011](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=182.011), a state trust company to which the banking commissioner issues a charter shall at all times maintain restricted capital in at least the amount required under Subsection (a) and in any additional amount the banking commissioner requires under Subsection (b).
    
    (e)  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), on application, the banking commissioner may, on a case-by-case basis in the exercise of discretion, reduce the amount of minimum restricted capital required for a state trust company in a manner consistent with protecting the state trust company's safety and soundness.  In making a determination under this subsection, the banking commissioner shall consider the factors listed by Subsection (b).

    Sec. 182.010.  PARITY.  (a)  A state trust company has the same rights and privileges with respect to the exercise of fiduciary powers that are or may be granted to a trust institution that maintains its principal office or a branch or trust office in this state, except that this section may not be used by a state trust company to:
    
    (1)  diminish its otherwise applicable fiduciary duties to a client under the laws of this state;  or
    
    (2)  avoid otherwise applicable consumer protection laws of this state.
    
    (b)  A state trust company that intends to exercise a right or privilege with respect to the exercise of fiduciary powers granted to a trust institution described in Subsection (a) that is not authorized for state trust companies under the statutes and rules of this state other than under this section shall submit a letter to the banking commissioner, describing in detail the activity in which the state trust company intends to engage and the specific authority for the trust institution described in Subsection (a) to undertake the proposed activity.  The state trust company shall attach copies, if available, of relevant state and federal law, including regulations and interpretive letters.  The state trust company may begin to perform the proposed activity after the 30th day after the date the banking commissioner receives the state trust company's letter unless the banking commissioner specifies an earlier or later date or prohibits the activity.  The banking commissioner may prohibit the state trust company from performing the activity only if the banking commissioner finds that:
    
    (1)  a trust institution described in Subsection (a) does not possess the specific right or privilege to perform the activity the state trust company seeks to perform;  or
    
    (2)  the performance of the activity by the state trust company would adversely affect the safety and soundness of the requesting state trust company.
    
    (c)  The banking commissioner may extend the 30-day period under Subsection (b) if the banking commissioner determines that the state trust company's letter raises issues requiring additional information or additional time for analysis.  If the 30-day period is extended, the state trust company may perform the proposed activity only on prior written approval by the banking commissioner, except that the banking commissioner must approve or prohibit the proposed activity or convene a hearing under Section [181.201](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=181.201) not later than the 60th day after the date the commissioner receives the state trust company's letter.  If a hearing is convened, the banking commissioner must approve or prohibit the proposed activity not later than the 30th day after the date the hearing is completed.
    
    (d)  A state trust company that is denied the requested right or privilege to engage in an activity by the banking commissioner under this section may appeal as provided by Sections [181.202](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=181.202) and [181.204](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=181.204) or may resubmit a letter under this section with additional information or authority relevant to the banking commissioner's determination.  A denial is immediately final for purposes of appeal.
    
    (e)  The finance commission may adopt rules implementing the method or manner in which a state trust company exercises specific rights and privileges, including rules regarding the exercise of rights and privileges that would be prohibited to state trust companies under state law except as provided by this section.  The finance commission may not adopt rules under this subsection unless it finds that:
    
    (1)  trust institutions described in Subsection (a) possess the rights or privileges to perform activities the rules would permit state trust companies to perform;  and

    (1)  may rely on the contract of agency and the instructions included in it;  and
    
    (2)  is not responsible for:

    Sec. 182.404.  PAYMENT TO CREDITORS.  The purchasing state trust company may pay a creditor of the selling institution the amount to be paid the creditor under the terms of the contract of agency by opening an agency account in the name of the creditor, crediting the account with the amount to be paid the creditor under the terms of the agency contract, and mailing or personally delivering a duplicate ticket evidencing the credit to the creditor at the creditor's address shown in the records of the selling institution.  The relationship between the purchasing state trust company and the creditor is that of agent to creditor only to the extent of the credit reflected by the ticket.

    Sec. 182.405.  SALE OF ASSETS.  (a)  A state trust company may sell all or any portion of its assets to another trust institution or other buyer, except that the prior written approval of the banking commissioner is required if the sales price exceeds an amount equal to three times the sum of the trust company's equity capital less intangible assets.  The finance commission by rule may require a state trust company to obtain the prior written approval of the banking commissioner for a transaction not otherwise subject to approval that involves potentially substantial risks to the safety and soundness of the selling trust company.
    
    (b)  If the prior approval of the banking commissioner for a sale of assets is not required under Subsection (a) and the sale involves the disposition of an established location of the state trust company, the state trust company must provide written notice of the transaction to the banking commissioner at least 30 days before the expected closing date of the transaction.
    
    (c)  The board of a state trust company, with the banking commissioner's approval, may cause the state trust company to sell all or substantially all of its assets, including the right to control accounts established with the state trust company, without shareholder or participant approval if:
    
    (1)  the banking commissioner finds that the interests of the state trust company's clients, depositors, and creditors are jeopardized because of the hazardous condition of the state trust company and that the sale is in their best interest; and
    
    (2)  the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or its successor approves the transaction, if the deposits of the state trust company are insured.
    
    (d)  A sale under Subsection (c) must include an assumption and promise by the buyer to pay or otherwise discharge:
    
    (1)  all of a state trust company's liabilities to clients and depositors;
    
    (2)  all of the state trust company's liabilities for salaries of the state trust company's employees incurred before the date of the sale;
    
    (3)  obligations incurred by the banking commissioner arising out of the supervision or sale of the state trust company; and
    
    (4)  fees and assessments due the department.
    
    (e)  This section does not affect the banking commissioner's right to take action under another law.  The sale by a state trust company of all or substantially all of its assets with shareholder or participant approval is considered a voluntary dissolution and liquidation and is governed by Subchapter [B](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=186.101), Chapter [186](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=FI&Value=186).
    
    (f)  Each buyer in a transaction described by Subsection (c) that is a trust institution or other fiduciary shall succeed by operation of law to all of the rights, privileges, and fiduciary obligations of the selling state trust company under each account included in the assets acquired.

    (2)   the state trust company has filed with the banking commissioner:

    (B)  a certified copy of all minutes of board meetings and shareholder or participant meetings at which action was taken regarding the merger or conversion; 
    
    (3)  the banking commissioner determines that:
    
    (A)  all accounts and liabilities of the state trust company are fully discharged, assumed, or otherwise retained by the successor trust institution;
    
    (B)  any conditions imposed by the banking commissioner for the protection of clients and creditors have been met or otherwise resolved; and
    
    (C)  any required filing fees have been paid; and
    
    (4)  the state trust company has received a certificate of authority to do business as the successor trust institution.

    Sec. 182.502.  CONVERSION OF TRUST INSTITUTION INTO STATE TRUST COMPANY.  (a)  A trust institution may apply to the banking commissioner for conversion into a state trust company on a form prescribed by the banking commissioner and accompanied by any required fee if the trust institution follows the procedures prescribed by the laws of the United States, this state, another state, or another country governing the exit of the trust institution for the purpose of conversion into a state trust company from the regulatory system applicable before the conversion.  A trust association or limited trust association may convert its organizational form under this section.
    
    (b)  A trust institution applying to convert into a state trust company may receive a certificate of authority to do business as a state trust company if the banking commissioner finds that:
    
    (1)  the trust institution is not engaging in a pattern or practice of unsafe and unsound fiduciary or banking practices;
    
    (2)  the trust institution has adequate capitalization for a state trust company to act as a fiduciary at the same locations as the trust institution is acting as a fiduciary before the conversion;
    
    (3)  the trust institution can be expected to operate profitably after the conversion;
    
    (4)  the officers and directors of the trust institution as a group have sufficient fiduciary experience, ability, standing, competence, trustworthiness, and integrity to justify a belief that the trust institution will operate as a state trust company in compliance with law; and

    (c)  The banking commissioner may:
    
    (1)  request additional information considered necessary to make an informed decision under this section;
    
    (2)  perform an examination of the converting trust institution at the expense of the converting trust institution;  and
    
    (3)  require that examination fees be paid before a certificate of authority is issued.
    
    (d)  In connection with the application, the converting trust institution must:
    
    (1)  submit a statement of the law governing the exit of the trust institution from the regulatory system applicable before the conversion and the terms of the transition into a state trust company;  and
    
    (2)  demonstrate that all applicable law has been fully satisfied.
