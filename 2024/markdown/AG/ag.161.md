If the court does not sustain the occurrence of the violation, the court shall order that no penalty is owed.
    
    (p)  When the judgment of the court becomes final, the court shall proceed under this subsection.  If the person paid the amount of the penalty and if that amount is reduced or is not upheld by the court, the court shall order that the appropriate amount plus accrued interest be remitted to the person.  The rate of the interest is the rate charged on loans to depository institutions by the New York Federal Reserve Bank, and the interest shall be paid for the period beginning on the date the penalty was paid and ending on the date the penalty is remitted.  If the person gave a supersedeas bond and if the amount of the penalty is not upheld by the court, the court shall order the release of the bond.  If the person gave a supersedeas bond and if the amount of the penalty is reduced, the court shall order the release of the bond after the person pays the amount.
