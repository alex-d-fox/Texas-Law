    SUBCHAPTER A. COTTON PEST CONTROL
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 74.001.  PUBLIC NUISANCE.  (a)  The legislature finds that cotton pests are a menace to the cotton industry, and that control of those pests is a public necessity.  Any portion of the state that is susceptible to infestation by cotton pests must be protected from this public nuisance and threat to the continued stability of the cotton industry.
    
    (b)  The legislature finds that volunteer and other noncommercial cotton is a public nuisance that threatens the cotton growers' boll weevil eradication program by serving as a host for cotton pests such as boll weevils and pink bollworms.  To protect the cotton industry of this state, volunteer and other noncommercial cotton must be eliminated subject to the provisions of this chapter.

    Sec. 74.0032.  HOSTABLE COTTON FEE.  (a)  The department shall establish and collect a hostable cotton fee for fields in which hostable cotton stalks, hostable volunteer cotton, or other hostable noncommercial cotton remains past the stalk destruction deadline set for the applicable pest management zone under Section [74.0031](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=AG&Value=74.0031).  A fee under this section shall be expressed in terms of dollars per acre, per week in which the stalks, volunteer cotton, or other noncommercial cotton remains in the field.  The department shall establish a procedure to notify a cotton grower that a fee is due the department under this section.
    
    (b)  If adverse weather conditions or other good cause exists, the Texas Boll Weevil Eradication Foundation may request that the department grant an extension of the cotton stalk destruction deadline for any specified part of the pest management zone or for the entire pest management zone.  A request under this subsection must be made within the period specified by department rule.  A field is not subject to a hostable cotton fee if the department grants an extension of the deadline.  The Texas Boll Weevil Eradication Foundation shall submit to the department an estimate of the amount by which an extension under this subsection will increase the cost of administering the boll weevil eradication program.
    
    (c)  If the Texas Boll Weevil Eradication Foundation does not request an extension, or if the department denies a request for an extension of the cotton stalk destruction deadline for a specified part of a pest management zone, a cotton grower may apply for an individual extension of the deadline.  A request under this subsection must be made within the period specified by department rule.
    
    (d)  The Texas Boll Weevil Eradication Foundation shall submit to the department an estimate of the amount by which any extension of a stalk destruction deadline that is granted under Subsection (c) will increase the cost of administering the boll weevil eradication program.
    
    (e)  Any hostable cotton or hostable cotton stalks that remain in a field after the cotton stalk destruction deadline or any extension of the stalk destruction deadline has passed are subject to the hostable cotton fee established under Subsection (a).  Any hostable cotton or hostable cotton stalks that remain in a field for more than 30 days after the stalk destruction deadline or any extension of the deadline are subject to 150 percent of the hostable cotton fee established under Subsection (a).
    
    (f)  A hostable cotton fee shall be sent to the comptroller and may be appropriated only for the purpose of treating hostable cotton or for other expenses related to boll weevil eradication.  The department may contract with the Texas Boll Weevil Eradication Foundation or its successor entity for the treatment, control, or monitoring activities funded from the account.
    
    (g)  Unless the fee is paid on or before the 45th day after the date the department gives notice to a cotton grower that a hostable cotton fee is due, the department may destroy any cotton or cotton stalks that remain in the field, as provided by Section [74.004](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=AG&Value=74.004).
    
    (h)  The department shall adopt rules to administer this section.

    (b)  If on inspection of a field after the harvest deadline, the department determines that host plants or any parts or products of host plants have not been destroyed within the time specified by regulation of the department, the department may declare the field to be a public nuisance.
    
    (c)  On the declaration of a field as a public nuisance, the department may take any action necessary to complete destruction of host plants or host plant products or parts to prevent the spread of cotton pests from the infested area and shall:
    
    (1)  immediately give written notice to any farm owner and to the operator in charge of the field that the field is in violation of this section, instructing the owner and operator to destroy host plants or host plant products or parts within seven days after the date written notice is issued;
    
    (2)  post for a period of three consecutive days a copy of the notice on or in the immediate vicinity of the field in violation, if either the owner or operator of the field cannot be located after a reasonably diligent effort by the department;  and
    
    (3)  have the host plants or host plant products or parts destroyed, if no response is received by the department from either the owner or operator within four days after the date of posting of the notice at the field or if the department considers a response inadequate.
    
    (d)  If adverse weather conditions or other good cause exists, the commissioner may, on written request by a farm owner or operator, grant an extension of the date of implementation of appropriate host plant or host plant product or part destruction.
    
    (e)  If it becomes necessary for the department to contract with someone to destroy host plants or host plant products or parts, the farm owner or operator shall reimburse the department for 1-1/2 times the actual costs required for destruction.
    
    (f)  If neither the farm owner nor operator reimburses the department as provided by Subsection (e) of this section within 30 days after the date of the completion of department action and issuance by the department of a bill requesting payment, the department may place a lien against the property on which a violation of a department regulation under this section has occurred.
    
    (g)  The department may perfect the lien by filing the lien, a sworn statement of the indebtedness, and a description of the property subject to the lien with the county clerk of the county in which the property is located.  The lien must be filed within a 30-day period following the expiration of the 30-day period described in Subsection (f) of this section.  Within 180 days after the date of filing the lien, the department may file suit in a court of competent jurisdiction for collection of the account and foreclosure of the lien.  Neither the department nor any person to whom the account is assigned may be required to post a cost bond in the suit.  The court shall enter judgment for the debt with interest and costs of suit and foreclosing the lien on premises as the court determines necessary for the defraying of expenses, court costs, and the fees owed.
    
    (h)  All reimbursements and additional costs collected under this section shall be deposited in the State Treasury in a special fund to be appropriated to the department to carry out this subchapter.
    
    (i)  Reimbursement under Subsection (e) of this section does not prevent the department from seeking criminal or civil sanctions under this subchapter.
    
    (j)  In this section, "harvest deadline" means a deadline set by the department for harvesting a certain crop or, in the absence of a department deadline, the 31st day after the date by which the crop is customarily harvested in the region, as determined by the department.

    SUBCHAPTER D. OFFICIAL COTTON GROWERS' BOLL WEEVIL ERADICATION FOUNDATION
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 74.101.  FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.  (a)  It is hereby found and declared that:
    
    (1)  the insects Anthonomus grandis Boheman, known as the boll weevil, and Pectinophora gossypiella, known as the pink bollworm, are public nuisances and a menace to the cotton industry, and their eradication is a public necessity;
    
    (2)  because of the differences in soil conditions, growing seasons, farming techniques, and climate conditions among several areas in the state where cotton is grown, the eradication and suppression of the nuisance can best be accomplished by dividing the cotton-growing areas into separate zones so that integrated pest management programs may be developed for each zone;
    
    (3)  there is a need for a quasi-governmental entity acting under the supervision and control of the commissioner whose members are actual cotton growers who would be represented on the board of the entity by directors elected by them to manage eradication and suppression programs and to furnish expertise in the field of insect control and eradication, because such an entity would enhance the interest and participation of cotton growers in the program;
    
    (4)  because of the progress made in eradication, investments made by cotton growers in certain areas, the potential injustice to certain cotton growers who have made such investments, and the stage of development of the cotton crops in the statutory eradication zones, an urgent public necessity exists to validate and ratify the assessments, agreements, and obligations of the Texas Boll Weevil Eradication Foundation, Inc., made or incurred by the foundation and related to certain statutory zones;
    
    (5)  cotton growers, in partnership with the state and federal governments, have made significant investments toward the eradication of these pests in this state;
    
    (6)  it is essential to the well-being of the cotton industry and the agricultural economy of this state that the investments of the cotton growers and the state and federal governments be protected; and
    
    (7)  the establishment of a maintenance program to be carried out by the foundation under the supervision of the department is required to protect the investments in eradication.

    Sec. 74.115.  PAYMENT OF ASSESSMENTS;  ASSESSMENT LIENS.  (a)  A cotton grower who fails to pay an assessment levied under this subchapter when due may be subject, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing, to a penalty set by the commissioner.  In determining the amount of the penalty to be assessed, the commissioner shall consider:
    
    (1)  the seriousness of the violation, including the nature, circumstances, and extent of the violation;
    
    (2)  the history of previous violations;
    
    (3)  the amount necessary to deter future violations;
    
    (4)  the economic situation of the cotton grower;  and
    
    (5)  any other matter that justice may require.
    
    (b)  The foundation may develop a compliance certificate program to manage the payment and collection of an assessment levied under this subchapter.  Under the program the foundation, subject to department rules, may issue a compliance certificate for cotton for which an assessment has been paid.
    
    (c)  In addition to any other remedies for the collection of assessments and penalties, the commissioner may adopt rules relating to the compliance certificate program for eradication assessments.  The rules may include:
    
    (1)  provisions establishing and relating to the obligations of growers, ginners, and buyers in due course of cotton produced in active eradication zones to ensure that assessments are paid within a prescribed time period;
    
    (2)  provisions allowing incentives in the form of discounted assessments for growers who pay assessments within a prescribed time period;
    
    (3)  provisions establishing penalties and interest against growers who pay assessments after a prescribed time period;  and
    
    (4)  other provisions the commissioner may determine are proper.
    
    (d)  In addition to any other remedies for the collection of assessments and penalties, an assessment lien in favor of the foundation attaches and is perfected 60 days after the date the foundation mails notice of the assessment on cotton produced and harvested that year from the acreage that is subject to the assessment that is due and unpaid.  An assessment lien is not an agricultural lien for the purposes of Chapter [9](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9), Business & Commerce Code, and is not subject to the provisions of that chapter.  An assessment lien is subject to and preempted by the Food Security Act of 1985 (7 U.S.C. Section 1631 et seq.) and shall be treated under that Act in the same manner as a security interest created by the seller.  A buyer of cotton takes free of the assessment lien if the buyer:
    
    (1)  receives a compliance certificate issued by the foundation when the buyer purchases the cotton that certifies that the assessment has been paid to the foundation;
    
    (2)  pays for the cotton by a check on which the department is named as a joint payee;
    
    (3)  does not receive notice of the assessment lien as required by the Food Security Act of 1985 (7 U.S.C. Section 1631 et seq.);  or
    
    (4)  buys the cotton from a person other than the producer of the cotton.
    
    (e)  The foundation may assign, with the approval of the commissioner, assessments or liens in favor of the foundation as collateral for a loan to the foundation only if the proceeds of the loan are designated for use in the eradication zone from which the assessments or liens originated.
    
    (f)  If the department has cause to believe that a violation of this section or rules promulgated under this section has occurred, the department may investigate and, during normal business hours, audit and inspect the records of the person who is the subject of the investigation.

    (c)  A cotton grower who applies for an exemption under this section must use a form prescribed by the commissioner.  A cotton grower must file a separate application form for each year for which the cotton grower claims an exemption.
    
    (d)  The commissioner may establish a payment plan for a cotton grower applying for an exemption under this section.
    
    (e)  The commissioner shall promptly notify an applicant of the determination regarding the applicant's request for an exemption.
    
    (f)  If an exemption under this section is denied, assessments and penalties for the year for which the application is made are due on the later of:
    
    (1)  the date on which they would be due in the absence of an application for exemption;  or
