Instead of retaining and selling the animals under Section [167.107](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/GetStatute.aspx?Code=AG&Value=167.107), the officer may perfect and foreclose a lien granted by this section.

    (d)  A peace officer may perfect a lien under Subsection (b) by filing a sworn statement covering a single treatment or a number of treatments with the clerk of the district court.  The statement must show the number of animals treated and must describe the animals.  The statement must be filed within 12 months after each treatment.
    
    (e)  A peace officer may foreclose a lien under Subsection (a) by filing suit against the owner of the animals in a court of competent jurisdiction for collection of the account and foreclosure of the lien.  The suit must be filed within 24 months after the statement is filed with the county clerk.  In the suit, the court may not require a cost bond of the peace officer or any person to whom the peace officer has assigned the account.  The court shall enter judgment for the debt, with interest and costs of suit, and for foreclosure of the lien on the number of animals that the court determines necessary to defray the expenses and fees secured.
    
    (f)  The court shall foreclose a lien under Subsection (b) of this section after the filing of the statement and shall do so against the number of animals necessary for the payment of the expenses and costs.  The court shall order those animals sold as under execution.
    
    (g)  If a lien is foreclosed under this section, the remainder of the proceeds of the sale following deduction of expenses and costs shall be paid to the clerk of the court in which the suit is pending and are subject to the order of the owner of the animals.
