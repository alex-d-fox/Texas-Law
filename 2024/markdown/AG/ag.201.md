    TITLE 7. SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION
    
      
    
    
    CHAPTER 201. SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION
    
      
    
    
    SUBCHAPTER A. GENERAL PROVISIONS
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 201.001.  FINDINGS, PURPOSE, AND POLICY.  (a)  The legislature finds that the farm and grazing lands of the State of Texas are among the basic assets of the state and that the preservation of these lands is necessary to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of its people;  that improper land-use practices have caused and have contributed to, and are now causing and contributing to, progressively more serious erosion of the farm and grazing lands of this state by wind and water;  that the breaking of natural grass, plant, and forest cover has interfered with the natural factors of soil stabilization, causing loosening of soil and exhaustion of humus, and developing a soil condition that favors erosion;  that the topsoil is being blown and washed out of fields and pastures;  that there has been an accelerated washing of sloping fields;  that these processes of erosion by wind and water speed up with removal of absorptive topsoil, causing exposure of less absorptive and less protective but more erosive subsoil;  that failure by an occupier of land to conserve the soil and control erosion upon the land causes a washing and blowing of soil and water onto other lands and makes the conservation of soil and control of erosion on those other lands difficult or impossible.
    
    (b)  The consequences of soil erosion in the form of soil-blowing and soil-washing are the silting and sedimentation of stream channels, reservoirs, dams, ditches, and harbors;  the loss of fertile soil material in dust storms;  the piling up of soil on lower slopes, and its deposit over alluvial plains;  the reduction in productivity or outright ruin of rich bottom lands by overwash of poor subsoil material, sand, and gravel swept out of the hills;  deterioration of soil and its fertility, deterioration of crops, and declining acre yields despite development of scientific processes for increasing such yields;  loss of soil and water that causes destruction of food and cover for wildlife;  a blowing and washing of soil into streams that silt over spawning beds and destroy waterplants, diminishing the food supply of fish;  a diminishing of the underground water reserve that causes water shortages, intensifies periods of drought, and causes crop failures;  an increase in the speed and volume of rainfall runoff, causing severe and increasing floods that bring suffering, disease, and death;  impoverishment of families attempting to farm eroding and eroded lands;  damage to roads, highways, railways, farm buildings, and other property from floods and from dust storms;  and losses in navigation, hydroelectric power, municipal water supply, irrigation developments, farming, and grazing.
    
    (c)  In order to conserve soil resources and control and prevent soil erosion, it is necessary that land-use practices contributing to soil waste and soil erosion may be discouraged and discontinued, and appropriate soil-conserving land-use practices be adopted and carried out.  Among the procedures necessary for widespread adoption are engineering operations such as the construction of terraces, terrace outlets, check dams, dikes, ponds, ditches, and the like;  the utilization of strip-cropping, lister furrowing, contour cultivating, and contour furrowing;  land irrigation;  seeding and planting of waste, sloping, abandoned, or eroded lands to water-conserving and erosion-preventing plants, trees, and grasses;  forestation and reforestation;  rotation of crops, soil stabilization with trees, grasses, legumes, and other thick-growing, soil-holding crops, retardation of runoff by increasing absorption of rainfall;  and retirement from cultivation of steep, highly erosive areas and areas now badly gullied or otherwise eroded.
    
    (d)  It is the policy of the legislature to provide for the conservation of soil and related resources of this state and for the control and prevention of soil erosion, and thereby to preserve natural resources, control floods, prevent impairment of dams and reservoirs, assist in maintaining the navigability of rivers and harbors, preserve wildlife, protect the tax base, protect public lands, and protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the people of this state, and thus to carry out the mandate expressed in Article XVI, Section 59a, of the Texas Constitution.  It is further declared as a matter of legislative intent and determination of policy that the State Soil and Water Conservation Board is the state agency responsible for implementing the constitutional provisions and state laws relating to the conservation and protection of soil resources.

    (i)  A water quality management plan developed under this section that covers land on which animal carcasses will be buried must include:
    
    (1)  disposal management practices for the carcasses, including a requirement that poultry carcasses may be buried on site only in the event of a major die-off that exceeds the capacity of a poultry facility to handle and dispose of poultry carcasses by the normal means used by the facility;  and
    
    (2)  burial site requirements that identify suitable locations for burial based on site-specific factors including:
    
    (A)  land use;
    
    (B)  soil conditions;  and
    
    (C)  proximity to groundwater or surface water supplies.
    
    (j)  The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality may not require a landowner who requests and complies with a water quality management plan under Subsection (i) to record the burial of animal carcasses in the county deed records or report the burial to the commission.
    
    (k)  The state board shall notify the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality not later than the 10th business day after the date the state board decertifies a water quality management plan for an animal feeding operation.
    
    (l)  The state board shall update the state board's identification of priority areas for the control of nonpoint source pollution at least every four years.  The state board, in considering changes to the identified priority areas, shall consider:
    
    (1)  bodies of water the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has identified as impaired through the state water quality assessment process;
    
    (2)  threatened areas in which action is necessary to prevent nonpoint source pollution;  and
    
    (3)  other areas of concern, including groundwater concerns.
    
    (m)  Complaints concerning a violation of a water quality management plan or a violation of a law or rule relating to agricultural or silvicultural nonpoint source pollution under the jurisdiction of the state board shall be referred to the state board.

If the occupier of the land is not the owner, the owner shall be joined as a party defendant.  The petition to the court may request that the court:
    
    (1)  require the defendant to perform the work, operations, or avoidances within a reasonable time;
    
    (2)  order that if the defendant fails to perform, the directors may go upon the land and perform the work or other operations or otherwise bring the condition of the land into conformity with the land-use regulations;  and

    (c)  The petition to the court must be verified and must:
    
    (1)  set forth the adoption of the ordinance prescribing the land-use regulations;
    
    (2)  set forth the failure of the defendant to observe the regulations and to perform the particular work, operations, or avoidances required by the regulations;  and

If it appears to the court that testimony is necessary for the proper disposition of the matter, the court may take evidence or appoint a referee to take evidence as the court directs and to report the evidence to the court with findings of fact and conclusions of law.  The findings and conclusions of a referee constitute part of the proceedings on which the court may make its determination.  The court may dismiss the petition or may:
    
    (1)  require the defendant to perform the work, operations, or avoidances;
    
    (2)  order that, on the failure of the defendant to initiate performance within a time specified in the order of the court and to perform to completion with reasonable diligence, the directors may enter on the land involved and perform the work or operation or otherwise bring the condition of the land into conformity with the regulations;  and
    
    (3)  order that the directors recover their costs and expenses, with interest.
    
    (e)  The court shall retain jurisdiction of the case until after the work has been completed.  If the work is performed by the directors under the order of the court, the directors, after completion of the work, may file a petition with the court stating the costs and expenses sustained by them in the performance of the work and seeking judgment for those costs and expenses, with interest.  The court may enter judgment for the amount of the costs and expenses, with interest, and for the costs of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee fixed by the court, but the total charge to a defendant for work done by the directors or anyone under the directors may not exceed in any one year an amount equal to 10 percent of the assessed valuation of the land for state and county purposes.
