    SUBCHAPTER C. CITRUS MARKETING AGREEMENTS AND LICENSES
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 102.151.  POLICY.  The unreasonable waste and inefficient use of the citrus resources, caused by the marketing within this state of greater quantities of fresh citrus fruit than are reasonably necessary to supply the demands of the market, are not in the public interest.  The difficulty inherent in an attempt of individuals to correlate within a reasonable degree the citrus production to current demand creates chaotic economic conditions in the citrus areas of the state of such severity as to imperil the ability of citrus producers to contribute in appropriate amounts to the support of ordinary governmental and educational functions, thus tending to increase the tax burden of other taxpayers for the same purposes, and renders it impossible for producers to be reasonably assured of an adequate standard of living for themselves and their families.  In the interest of the public welfare and general prosperity of the state, the unreasonable waste and inefficient use of citrus resources involved in the marketing of citrus fruit in this state should be eliminated, while at the same time preserving to citrus producers in the area covered by this subchapter an equality of opportunity.

    Sec. 102.156.  FINDINGS.  (a)  Following a hearing, the department may execute a marketing agreement or issue a license only if it finds that:
    
    (1)  the supply of a citrus fruit available for marketing exceeds or is likely to exceed the demand for the fruit at prices that will provide a reasonable return to representative producers of that fruit;
    
    (2)  the return to producers of the citrus fruit will tend to be increased through the operation of the marketing plan;
    
    (3)  the marketing plan may be operated without permitting unreasonable profits to producers of the citrus fruit and without unreasonably enhancing prices of the citrus fruit to consumers;  and
    
    (4)  the marketing plan will tend to advance public welfare and conserve the agricultural wealth of the state by preventing threatened economic or agricultural waste and will tend to prevent chaotic marketing of the citrus fruit.
