    Sec. 251.004.  NUISANCE OR OTHER ACTIONS.  (a)  No nuisance action or other action to restrain an agricultural operation may be brought against an agricultural operation that has lawfully been in operation and substantially unchanged for one year or more prior to the date on which the action is brought.  A person who brings a nuisance action or other action to restrain an agricultural operation that is not prohibited by this section must establish each element of the action by clear and convincing evidence.  This subsection does not restrict or impede the authority of this state or a political subdivision to enforce state law, including an enforcement action by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.  For the purposes of this subsection, a substantial change to an agricultural operation means a material alteration to the operation of or type of production at an agricultural operation that is substantially inconsistent with the operational practices since the established date of operation.
    
    (b)  A person who brings a nuisance action or other action to restrain an agricultural operation and seeks damages or injunctive relief against an agricultural operation that has existed for one year or more prior to the date that the action is instituted or who violates the provisions of Subsection (a) is liable to the agricultural operator for:
    
    (1)  all costs and expenses incurred in defense of the action, including attorney's fees, court costs, travel, and other related incidental expenses incurred in the defense; and
    
    (2)  any other damages found by the trier of fact.
    
    (c)  This section does not affect or defeat the right of any person to recover for injuries or damages sustained because of an agricultural operation or portion of an agricultural operation that is conducted in violation of a federal, state, or local statute or governmental requirement that applies to the agricultural operation or portion of an agricultural operation.

    Sec. 251.005.  EFFECT OF GOVERNMENTAL REQUIREMENTS.  (a)  For purposes of this section, the effective date of a governmental requirement is the date on which the requirement requires or attempts to require compliance as to the geographic area encompassed by the agricultural operation.  The recodification of a municipal ordinance does not change the original effective date to the extent of the original requirements.
    
    (b)  A governmental requirement of a political subdivision of the state other than a city:
    
    (1)  applies to an agricultural operation with an established date of operation subsequent to the effective date of the requirement;
    
    (2)  does not apply to an agricultural operation with an established date of operation prior to the effective date of the requirement;  and
    
    (3)  applies to an agricultural operation if the governmental requirement was in effect and was applicable to the operation prior to the effective date of this chapter.

    (1)  there is clear and convincing evidence that the purposes of the requirement cannot be addressed through less restrictive means and that the requirement is necessary to protect persons who reside in the immediate vicinity or persons on public property in the immediate vicinity of the agricultural operation from the imminent danger of:
    
    (A)  explosion;
    
    (B)  flooding;

    (2)  determines the necessity of regulation and the manner in which agricultural operation should be regulated;

    (4)  if applicable, includes an explanation why the report recommends a manner of regulation that will restrict the use of a generally accepted agricultural practice that the manual indicates does not pose a threat to public health.
    
    (c)  A city may not impose a governmental requirement that directly or indirectly:
    
    (1)  prohibits the use of a generally accepted agricultural practice listed in the manual prepared under Section [251.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=AG&Value=251.007), except as provided by Subsections (a) and (b);
