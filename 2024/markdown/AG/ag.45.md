    CHAPTER 45.  TEXAS-ISRAEL EXCHANGE RESEARCH PROGRAM
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 45.001.  LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS; PURPOSE.  (a)  The legislature finds that Texas and Israel have many interests in common.  They face many of the same difficulties in agriculture; the geography of both areas produces semiarid climatic conditions; there is present in both areas a rising demand for a limited supply of water coupled with increasing pressures to minimize the use of energy in all aspects of agriculture.  Scientific and technological cooperatives already produce close ties between the two areas while engaging in binational projects for scientific and industrial research and development.
    
    A program to support joint agricultural research and development by, and the development of trade and business relations between, Texas and Israel will address common problems and make substantial contributions to the development of agriculture, trade, and business in both areas.  Since Texas has long emphasized broad-based agricultural research and Israel has originated and developed agricultural technologies designed to maximize production with minimal use of resources such as water and labor, each of the two areas will benefit by sharing information and expertise.
    
    (b)  The purpose of this chapter is to:
    
    (1)  establish a program to promote and support practical and applied agricultural research and development that will result in mutual benefit to Texas and Israel and will help to provide solutions to food and fiber production problems wherever they exist, particularly those relating to water conservation; and
    
    (2)  establish a program of mutual cooperation that will foster the development of trade, mutual assistance, and business relations between Texas and Israel.
