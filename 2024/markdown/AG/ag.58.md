    (c)  The board may provide for the establishment and maintenance of separate accounts within the Texas agricultural fund, including program accounts as prescribed by the board, an interest and sinking account, a reserve account, and other accounts provided for by the board in its resolutions.

The authority's bonds are not and do not create or constitute a pledge, giving, or lending of the faith or credit or taxing power of the state.  Each bond of the authority issued under this section must contain a statement to the effect that the state is not obligated to pay the principal of or any premium or interest on the bond, and that neither the faith or credit nor the taxing power of the state is pledged, given, or loaned to such a payment.

    (d)  The board may make additional covenants with respect to the bonds and the pledged revenues and may provide for the flow of funds, the establishment and maintenance and investment of funds, which may include interest and sinking funds, reserve funds, program funds, and other funds.  Those funds shall be kept and maintained in escrow and in trust by the comptroller for and on behalf of the authority and the owners of its revenue bonds, in funds held outside the treasury pursuant to Chapter [404](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=404), Government Code.  Those funds shall be used only as provided by this chapter, and pending their use shall be invested as provided by any resolution of the authority.  Legal title to those funds shall be in the authority unless or until paid out as provided by this chapter or by the resolutions authorizing the authority's bonds.  The comptroller, as custodian, shall administer those funds strictly and only as provided by this chapter and in those resolutions.  The comptroller shall invest the funds in investments authorized by law for state funds.  The state shall take no action with respect to those funds other than that specified in this chapter and in those resolutions.
    
    (e)  The board may provide in the resolution authorizing any revenue bonds for the issuance of additional bonds to be equally and ratably secured by lien on the revenues and receipts, or for the issuance of subordinate lien bonds.
    
    (f)  Revenues of the authority that may be used as a source of payment for the bonds or to establish a reserve fund to secure the payment of debt service on the bonds or related obligations of the authority include repayments of financial assistance, money appropriated by the legislature to the authority for the purpose of paying or securing the payment of debt service on the authority's revenue bonds or related obligations, federal or private money allocated to financial assistance programs established under this chapter, amounts paid under any credit agreement for those purposes, or any other money that the authority pledges or otherwise commits for those purposes.  To the extent that pledged revenues include amounts appropriated by the legislature, the revenue bonds must state on their face that those revenues are available to pay debt service only if appropriated by the legislature for that purpose.

(a)  The authority's bonds may be issued from time to time in one or more series or issues, in bearer, registered, or any other form, which may include registered uncertified obligations not represented by written instruments and commonly known as book-entry obligations, the registration of ownership and transfer of which shall be provided for by the authority under a system of books and records maintained by the authority or by an agent appointed by the authority in resolution providing for issuance of its bonds.  Bonds may mature serially or otherwise not more than 40 years from their date.  Bonds may bear no interest or may bear interest at any rate or rates, fixed, variable, floating, or otherwise, determined by the board or determined pursuant to any contractual arrangements approved by the board, not to exceed the maximum net effective interest rate allowed by Chapter [1204](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=1204), Government Code. Interest on the bonds may be payable at any time, and the rate of interest on the bonds may be adjusted at such time as may be determined by the board or as may be determined pursuant to any contractual arrangement approved by the board.  In connection with the issuance of its bonds, the board may exercise the powers granted to the governing body of an issuer in connection with the issuance of obligations under Chapter [1371](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=1371), Government Code, to the extent not inconsistent with this chapter.

The bonds are exempt securities under The Securities Act (Title 12, Government Code), and unless specifically provided otherwise, under any subsequently enacted securities act.  Any contract, guaranty, or any other document executed in connection with the issuance of bonds pursuant to this chapter is not a security under The Securities Act (Title 12, Government Code) and, unless specifically provided otherwise, any subsequently enacted securities act.  The board is authorized to do all things necessary to qualify the bonds for offer and sale under the securities laws and regulations of the United States and of the states and other jurisdictions in the United States as the board shall determine.
    
    (c)  The bonds may be issued in the form and denominations and executed in the manner and under the terms, conditions, and details determined as provided by the board in the resolution authorizing their issuance.  If any officer whose manual or facsimile signature appears on the bonds ceases to be an officer, the signature is still valid and sufficient for all purposes as if the officer had remained in office.
    
    (d)  All bonds issued by the authority are subject to review and approval by the attorney general in the same manner and with the same effect as is provided by Chapter [1371](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=1371), Government Code.
