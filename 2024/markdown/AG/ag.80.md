    MANAGEMENT CORPORATION
    
      
    
    
    Sec. 80.001.  FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.  (a)  The legislature finds that:
    
    (1)  citrus pests and diseases, including the insect known as the Asian citrus psyllid and the disease known as citrus greening, are public nuisances and menaces to the citrus industry, and their control and suppression is a public necessity;
    
    (2)  because of the natural migration patterns of citrus pests and the contagious nature of citrus diseases, the control and suppression of the nuisance can best be accomplished by dividing the commercial citrus-growing areas into separate zones so that integrated pest management programs may be developed for each zone;
    
    (3)  there is a need for a quasi-governmental entity acting under the supervision and control of the commissioner whose members are actual citrus producers who would be represented on the board of the entity by directors elected by them to manage control and suppression programs and to furnish expertise in the field of disease and insect control and suppression, because such an entity would enhance the interest and participation of citrus producers in the program;
    
    (4)  citrus producers, in partnership with the state and federal governments, have made significant investments toward the suppression of these pests and disease in this state; and
    
    (5)  it is essential to the well-being of the citrus industry and the agricultural economy of this state that the investments of the citrus producers and the state and federal governments be protected.
    
    (b)  It is the intent of the legislature that the program of control and suppression of citrus pests and diseases be carried out with the best available integrated pest management techniques.
    
    (c)  The department may recover costs for administration of this chapter.

    Sec. 80.002.  DESIGNATION OF ENTITY TO CARRY OUT CITRUS PEST AND DISEASE CONTROL AND SUPPRESSION.  (a)  The Texas Citrus Pest and Disease Management Corporation, Inc., a Texas nonprofit corporation, shall be recognized by the department as the entity to plan, carry out, and operate suppression programs to manage and control pests and diseases, including the Asian citrus psyllid and citrus greening, in citrus plants in the state under the supervision of the department as provided by this chapter.
    
    (b)  The commissioner may terminate the corporation's designation as the entity recognized to carry out citrus pest and disease control and management by giving 45 days' written notice to the corporation and by designating a successor entity.  If the commissioner designates a successor to the corporation, the successor has all the powers and duties of the corporation under this chapter.

    Sec. 80.017.  PAYMENT OF ASSESSMENTS; ASSESSMENT LIENS.  (a)  A citrus producer who fails to pay an assessment levied under this chapter when due may be subject, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing, to a penalty set by the commissioner.  In determining the amount of the penalty to be assessed, the commissioner shall consider:
    
    (1)  the seriousness of the violation, including the nature, circumstances, and extent of the violation;
    
    (2)  the history of previous violations;
    
    (3)  the amount necessary to deter future violations;
    
    (4)  the economic situation of the citrus producer; and
    
    (5)  any other matter that justice may require.
    
    (b)  The corporation may develop a compliance certificate program to manage the payment and collection of an assessment levied under this chapter.  Under the program the corporation, subject to department rules, may issue a compliance certificate for citrus for which an assessment has been paid.
    
    (c)  In addition to any other remedies for the collection of assessments and penalties, the commissioner may adopt rules relating to the compliance certificate program for suppression assessments.  The rules may include:
    
    (1)  provisions establishing and relating to the obligations of growers, packers, and buyers in due course of citrus produced in active pest management zones to ensure that assessments are paid within a prescribed time period;
    
    (2)  provisions allowing incentives in the form of discounted assessments for growers who pay assessments within a prescribed time period;
    
    (3)  provisions establishing penalties and interest against growers who pay assessments after a prescribed time period; and
    
    (4)  other provisions the commissioner determines are proper.
    
    (d)  In addition to any other remedies for the collection of assessments and penalties, an assessment lien in favor of the corporation attaches and is perfected 60 days after the date the corporation mails notice of the assessment on citrus produced and harvested that year from the acreage that is subject to the assessment that is due and unpaid.  An assessment lien is not an agricultural lien for the purposes of Chapter [9](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=BC&Value=9), Business & Commerce Code, and is not subject to the provisions of that chapter.  An assessment lien is subject to and preempted by the Food Security Act of 1985 (7 U.S.C. Section 1631 et seq.) and shall be treated under that Act in the same manner as a security interest created by the seller.  A buyer of citrus takes free of the assessment lien if the buyer:
    
    (1)  receives a compliance certificate issued by the corporation when the buyer purchases the citrus that certifies that the assessment has been paid to the corporation;
    
    (2)  pays for the citrus by a check on which the department is named as a joint payee;
    
    (3)  does not receive notice of the assessment lien as required by the Food Security Act of 1985 (7 U.S.C. Section 1631 et seq.); or
    
    (4)  buys the citrus from a person other than the producer of the citrus.
    
    (e)  The corporation may assign, with the approval of the commissioner, assessments or liens in favor of the corporation as collateral for a loan to the corporation only if the proceeds of the loan are designated for use in the pest management zone from which the assessments or liens originated.
    
    (f)  If the department believes that a violation of this section or a rule adopted under this section has occurred, the department may investigate and, during normal business hours, audit and inspect the records of the person who is the subject of the investigation.

    Sec. 80.0175.  SUIT TO COLLECT DELINQUENT ASSESSMENT.  (a)  At any time after an assessment becomes delinquent, the corporation may investigate conditions that relate to the prompt remittance of the assessment by a citrus producer.
    
    (b)  If the corporation determines that a citrus producer has failed to remit an assessment to the corporation as required by this chapter, the corporation may:
    
    (1)  independently bring suit against the citrus producer to obtain appropriate injunctive relief or a judgment in the amount due to the corporation, including:
    
    (A)  the amount of delinquent assessments;
    
    (B)  penalties assessed under Section [80.017](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=AG&Value=80.017)(a); and
    
    (C)  interest on delinquent assessments and penalties; or
    
    (2)  request the department, the attorney general, or a county or district attorney having jurisdiction to file suit on the corporation's behalf.
    
    (c)  A court shall order the injunctive relief necessary to ensure payment of the delinquent assessments by the citrus producer.
    
    (d)  A court shall grant injunctive relief under Subsection (b) without a bond.
    
    (e)  In a petition for injunctive relief under Subsection (b), the corporation may also seek to secure payment of assessments for the current year that are not yet delinquent. The corporation  shall estimate the amount of any assessments for the year that have not yet been made.
    
    (f)  A petition under Subsection (b) is sufficient if it alleges that:
    
    (1)  the corporation is legally constituted and authorized to impose and collect assessments from citrus producers;
    
    (2)  assessments in the amounts stated were legally imposed on the citrus producer for each year specified in the suit;
    
    (3)  the assessments are delinquent;
    
    (4)  penalties, interest, and costs allowed by law in the amounts stated are due in connection with the assessments;

    (6)  the corporation has done all things required under this chapter to enforce the payment of the assessments; and
    
    (7)  the attorney signing the petition is legally authorized to prosecute the suit on behalf of the corporation.
    
    (g)  The corporation, the department, the attorney general, and a county or district attorney are entitled to recover reasonable expenses incurred in obtaining injunctive relief or a judgment under this section, including:
    
    (1)  investigatory costs and fees;
    
    (2)  reasonable attorney's fees; and
    
    (3)  court costs.
    
    (h)  Venue for a suit under this section is in:
    
    (1)  Travis County; or
    
    (2)  the county in which the citrus producer named in the suit is located or conducts business related to the production of citrus.

    (b)  A citrus producer is not eligible for an exemption under this section for a year in which the amount computed by subtracting the assessments and penalties due under this chapter from the citrus producer's net income subject to federal income taxation in the previous year is greater than $15,000.
    
    (c)  A citrus producer who applies for an exemption under this section must use a form prescribed by the commissioner.  A citrus producer must file a separate application form for each year for which the citrus producer claims an exemption.
    
    (d)  The commissioner may establish a payment plan for a citrus producer applying for an exemption under this section.
    
    (e)  The commissioner shall promptly notify an applicant of the determination regarding the applicant's request for an exemption.
