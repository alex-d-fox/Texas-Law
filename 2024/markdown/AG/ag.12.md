    (A)  paying the amount of the penalty to the court for placement in an escrow account;  or
    
    (B)  giving to the court a supersedeas bond that is approved by the court for the amount of the penalty and that is effective until all judicial review of the commissioner's order is final;  or
    
    (2)  request the court to stay enforcement of the penalty by:
    
    (A)  filing with the court a sworn affidavit of the person stating that the person is financially unable to pay the amount of the penalty and is financially unable to give the supersedeas bond;  and
    
    (B)  giving a copy of the affidavit to the department by certified mail.
    
    (m)  The department on receipt of a copy of an affidavit under Subsection (l)(2) of this section may file with the court, within five days after the date the copy is received, a contest to the affidavit.

The person who files an affidavit has the burden of proving that the person is financially unable to pay the amount of the penalty and to give a supersedeas bond.
    
    (n)  If the person does not pay the amount of the penalty and the enforcement of the penalty is not stayed, the department may refer the matter to the attorney general for collection of the amount of the penalty.
    
    (o)  Judicial review of the order of the commissioner under Subsection (i):

    (2)  is under the substantial evidence rule.
    
    (p)  If the court sustains the occurrence of the violation, the court may uphold or reduce the amount of the penalty and order the person to pay the full or reduced amount of the penalty.  If the court does not sustain the occurrence of the violation, the court shall order that no penalty is owed.
    
    (q)  When the judgment of the court becomes final, the court shall proceed under this subsection.  If the person paid the amount of the penalty and if that amount is reduced or is not upheld by the court, the court shall order that the appropriate amount plus accrued interest be remitted to the person.  The rate of the interest is the rate charged on loans to depository institutions by the New York Federal Reserve Bank, and the interest shall be paid for the period beginning on the date the penalty was paid and ending on the date the penalty is remitted.  If the person gave a supersedeas bond and if the amount of the penalty is not upheld by the court, the court shall order the release of the bond.  If the person gave a supersedeas bond and if the amount of the penalty is reduced, the court shall order the release of the bond after the person pays the amount.
    
    (r)  A penalty collected under this section shall be deposited in the state treasury to the credit of the General Revenue Fund.
    
    (s)  All proceedings under this section are subject to Chapter [2001](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&Value=2001), Government Code, except as provided in Subsections (t) and (u).

    (B)  issued a finding of fact that is not supported by a preponderence  of the evidence;  or
    
    (2)  determines that a department policy or a prior administrative decision on which the administrative law judge relied is incorrect or should be changed.
    
    (u)  The commissioner shall state in writing the specific reason and legal basis for a determination under Subsection (t).

If more than one qualifying organization delivers meals in a county, the department shall reduce the grants proportionally to each qualifying organization in that county so that the total amount of the grants to the organizations does not exceed the amount described by Subsection (h).
    
    (j)  If the total amount of the grants made by the department under Subsection (i) is less than the amount appropriated to fund the program under this section in a state fiscal year, the department shall use the unspent funds to proportionally increase the grants to each qualifying organization.
