    (b)  Recovery on a bond shall be prorated if claims exceed liability on a bond, but a depositor suing on a bond is not required to join other depositors in a suit.

    (f)  A person is prohibited from filing a claim on an invalid receipt.
    
    (g)  An action under this section must be brought not later than the second anniversary of the date of expiration of the public grain warehouse license in effect at the time the claim arose.

(a)  If the department determines that a warehouse operator does not possess sufficient grain to cover outstanding receipts and outstanding scale weight tickets issued or assumed by the warehouse operator, or if a warehouse operator refuses or is unable to submit records or property for lawful inspection or the department is unable to conduct an inspection of the warehouse due to the condition of the warehouse or grain stored in the warehouse, the department may seal the warehouse to prevent delivery or receipt of grain except as authorized by the department, suspend the license of the warehouse operator, and give notice to the warehouse operator requiring the warehouse operator to submit records or property for lawful inspection, to correct any condition interfering with the department's inspection of the warehouse or grain, or to cover a shortage of a particular type of grain by:
    
    (1)  storing to the credit of or delivering to each depositor affected by the shortage grain of the same type and quality that is stored at any of the warehouse operator's licensed warehouses in this state and that has been designated as company-owned grain by the warehouse operator;
    
    (2)  purchasing and storing to the credit of or delivering to each depositor affected by the shortage grain of the same type and quality;

    (b)  A warehouse operator shall comply with the requirements of a notice issued under Subsection (a) within 24 hours of notification by the department or within a longer time allowed by the department.

The department may then audit and investigate the affairs of the public grain warehouse, especially with respect to the grain of which there is an apparent shortage.  The purpose of the audit and investigation is to determine the amount of the shortage and, if practicable, to compute the shortage as to each depositor, as shown by the warehouse operator's records.  The department shall notify the warehouse operator and the surety on the warehouse operator's bond of the approximate amount of the shortage.  The department shall notify each depositor affected by the shortage by sending notice to the depositor's last known address, as shown by the warehouse operator's records.
